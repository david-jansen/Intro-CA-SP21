    "For the midterm project, you will work with a partner(s) to computationally analyze a dataset, and you will write a short (500-1,000 word) blog post about an interesting finding or insight from your analysis. You will publish this blog post on Medium, specifically to our [Medium course page](https://medium.com/introduction-to-cultural-analytics) (to do so, you will need to make a [Medium account](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F&source=--------------------------lo_home_nav-----------)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission**: To submit this project for credit, each partner will submit a Jupyter notebook to Gradescope (\"Midterm-Project-LASTNAME.ipynb\") that includes a link to your co-authored blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peer Evaluation**: When you're finished with the project, you will also fill out a [peer evaluation](https://forms.gle/8sA8USor8gFTYhMF7) and evaluate the participation of each group member. If group members participate less than others, their grades will be adjusted to reflect this contribution.\n"

I was looking specifically for the people Hollywood chose to profile for a U.S. audience. A total of 676 films featuring 761 subjects were included in the sample...\"\n",

For example, both “Norma Rae” (1979) and “Belle” (2013) are based on true stories but are classified on IMDb as drama, and drama and romance, respectively. A number of biographical films may be missing from the sample as a result, but this analysis is a place to start.\"\n",
