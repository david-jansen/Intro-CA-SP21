ever\\n\\nChris: Today’s historic trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong marks a new season of hope for the future of world trade. The two countries have been at each other’s throats for years but now the hatchet’s been buried by a treaty which allows unrestricted trading between all parties at all levels. I’m joined now by Martin Craste, the British minister with special responsibility for the Commonwealth, and Gavin Hawtrey, the Australian foreign secretary, on camera. Gentlemen, this is pretty historic stuff, well done. A future of unbridled harmony then, Australia?\\n\\nGavin: Yes, I think Martin Craste and I can be pretty satisfied. It’s a good day\\n\\nChris: And if, as in the past, Australia exceed their agreement, what will you do about it?\\n\\nMartin: This is a very satisfactory treaty which I’m sure will work, well naturally if the limits were exceeded then this would be met with a firm line but I can’t see this being necessary\\n\\nChris: Mr. Hawtrey, he’s knocking a firm line in your direction. What are you going to do about that?\\n\\nGavin: Well, in that case we’d just reimpose sanctions as we did last year and then we’d-\\n\\nChris: Sanctions? Hold on a second, they’ve only just swallowed their sanctions and now they’re burping them back up in your face\\n\\nMartin: I think sanctions is rather premature talk, certainly. If sanctions were imposed we should have to retaliate with appropriate measures, but I can’t see-\\n\\nChris: I think “appropriate measures” is a euphemism, Mr. Hawtrey. You know what it means, what are you going to do about that?\\n\\nGavin: Well, I’d just have to go back to cabinet\\n\\nChris: And ask them about what?\\n\\nGavin: Well, I don’t know. Maybe it’s a matter for the military\\n\\nChris: The military?\\n\\nMartin: I think military measures is totally inappropriate reaction and I think this is way, way over the top\\n\\nChris: Sounds like you’re being inappropriate, are you?\\n\\nGavin: Of course I’m not being inappropriate, Martin Craste knows that full well\\n\\nMartin: This is the sort of misunderstanding that I thought we’d laid to rest during our negotiating period\\n\\nChris: Misunderstanding it certainly is, it’s certainly not a treaty, is it? You’re both at each other’s throats, you’re backing yourselfs up with arms, what are you going to do about it? Mr. Hawtrey, let me give you a hint; bang\\n\\nGavin: What are you asking me to say?\\n\\nChris: You know damn well what I’m asking you to say. You’re putting yourself in a situation of armed conflict, what are you plunging yourself into?\\n\\nGavin: You’d like me to say it?\\n\\nChris: I want you to say it, yes\\n\\nGavin: You want the word?\\n\\nChris: The word\\n\\nGavin: I will not flinch-\\n\\nChris: You will not flinch from?\\n\\nGavin: War\\n\\nChris: War. Gentlemen, I’ll put you on hold. If fighting did break out it would probably occur in Eastman’s Town in the upper cataracts on the Australio-Hong Kong border. Our reporter Donald Bethlehem is there now; Donald, what’s the atmosphere like?\\n\\nDonald: Tension here is very high, Chris. The stretched twig of peace is at melting point, people here are literally bursting with war. This is very much a country that’s going to blow up in its face\\n\\nChris: Well, gentlemen, it seems we have little option now but to declare war immediately\\n\\nMartin: Well, this is quite impossible. I couldn’t take such a decision without referring to my superior, Chris Patten, he’s in Hong Kong\\n\\nChris: Good, because he’s on the line now via satellite. Mr. Patten, what do you think of the idea of a war now? … I’ll take that as a yes\\n\\nMartin: Very well, it’s war\\n\\nGavin: War it is\\n\\nDonald: That’s it, Chris. It’s war, war has broken out, this is a war\\n\\nChris: That’s it, yes, it’s war\\n\\n#1 IANAHB2 scholar\\n\\nFavourite 5 albums:\\n- Fever\\n- Boy In Da Corner\\n- Ultravisitor\\n- YoYoYoYoYo\\n- Paul’s Boutique\\n\\nShout out to HailTheKing, who editored me, I think it was March 2nd 2013 but can’t be sure&quot;,&quot;api_path&quot;:&quot;/users/141291&quot;,&quot;avatar&quot;:{&quot;tiny&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/tiny/845fd01203157969bce194cbc8065f03&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:16,&quot;height&quot;:16}},&quot;thumb&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/thumb/845fd01203157969bce194cbc8065f03&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:32,&quot;height&quot;:32}},&quot;small&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/small/845fd01203157969bce194cbc8065f03&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:100,&quot;height&quot;:100}},&quot;medium&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/medium/845fd01203157969bce194cbc8065f03&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;height&quot;:400}}},&quot;header_image_url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/medium/845fd01203157969bce194cbc8065f03&quot;,&quot;human_readable_role_for_display&quot;:&quot;Contributor&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:141291,&quot;iq&quot;:84561,&quot;is_meme_verified&quot;:false,&quot;is_verified&quot;:false,&quot;login&quot;:&quot;123andtotha4&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;123andtotha4&quot;,&quot;role_for_display&quot;:&quot;contributor&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://genius.com/123andtotha4&quot;,&quot;current_user_metadata&quot;:{&quot;permissions&quot;:[],&quot;excluded_permissions&quot;:[&quot;follow&quot;],&quot;interactions&quot;:{&quot;following&quot;:false}}},&quot;authors&quot;:[{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;user_attribution&quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:0.33035714285714285,&quot;pinned_role&quot;:null,&quot;user&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;about_me_summary&quot;:&quot;AKA Jeremy Dean, Ph.D.\\nEducation Czar, Rap Genius\\njeremy@rapgenius.com\\nTwitter: @dr_jdean&quot;,&quot;api_path&quot;:&quot;/users/113876&quot;,&quot;avatar&quot;:{&quot;tiny&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/tiny/c8d88aa942add2006b7ff9cb8805f329&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:16,&quot;height&quot;:16}},&quot;thumb&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/thumb/c8d88aa942add2006b7ff9cb8805f329&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:32,&quot;height&quot;:32}},&quot;small&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/small/c8d88aa942add2006b7ff9cb8805f329&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:100,&quot;height&quot;:100}},&quot;medium&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/medium/c8d88aa942add2006b7ff9cb8805f329&quot;,&quot;bounding_box&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;height&quot;:400}}},&quot;header_image_url&quot;:&quot;https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/medium/c8d88aa942add2006b7ff9cb8805f329&quot;,&quot;human_readable_role_for_display&quot;:&quot;Contributor&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:113876,&quot;iq&quot;:106258,&quot;is_meme_verified&quot;:false,&quot;is_verified&quot;:false,&quot;login&quot;:&quot;Lucky_Desperado&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Dr. Jeremy Dean&quot;,&quot;role_for_display&quot;:&quot;contributor&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://genius.com/Lucky_Desperado&quot;,&quot;current_user_metadata&quot;:{&quot;permissions&quot;:[],&quot;excluded_permissions&quot;:[&quot;follow&quot;],&quot;interactions&quot;:{&quot;following&quot;:false}}}},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;user_attribution&quot;,&quot;attribution&quot;:0.26785714285714285,&quot;pinned_role&quot;:null,&quot;user&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;about_me_summary&quot;:&quot;2016-17 weren’t great.

The song memorably features backward lyrics and an elephant trumpting. It also helped popularize the term \"badonkadonk.” The song is a raunchy ode where Missy raps about sexing up guys. In his review of <em>Under Construction</em>, <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/under-construction-mw0000231192\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">allmusic’s John Bush</a> said the song, “turns the tables on male rappers, taking charge of the sex game, matching their lewdest, rudest rhymes.”</p>\n",

       "<blockquote><p>A fun fact about the song “Work It” is Tim and I would get on each other’s last nerves because we are truly like brother and sister. I remember I begged him to go to some mom and pop stores to get some break beats because we had been in the studio two weeks straight and had a block; we couldn’t think of anything. He finally got some records and caught this vibe and when I heard the worm sound, I was jumping up like, “That’s it!” So I would record in another room because I never record in front of anyone, and I ran and did my rap. Then I ran back and said, “Yo play it to him” and he said, “Nah, that ain’t it.” Then I went back again [and] brought it back and he said, “Nope, that ain’t it.” Then a third time, the same thing. By this time I thought he was being funny, so I’m pissed! By the fifth time he said, “Yes, that’s it! That shit hot!” But guess what? I got him back on the [Miss E…] So Addictive album, he thought we was done and I said, “Nope, that ain’t it!” about three times. Then he did “Get Ur Freak On” and I said, “Yup, that’s it!” Lol.</p></blockquote>\n",
