2021-02-04 14:00:56+00:00,2456,AskScience AMA Series: Updates on COVID vaccines. AUA!,AskScienceModerator,"Millions of people have now been vaccinated against SARS-COV-2 and new vaccine candidates are being approved by countries around the world. Yet infection numbers and deaths continue rising worldwide, and new strains of the virus are emerging. With barely a year's worth of clinical data on protections offered by the current batch of vaccines, numerous questions remain as to just how effective these different vaccines will be in ending this pandemic.

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions on how the current COVID vaccines work (and what the differences are between the different vaccines), what sort of protection the vaccine(s) offer against current, emerging and future strains of the virus, and how the various vaccine platforms used to develop the COVID vaccines can be used to fight against future diseases. Ask us anything!

2020-11-15 18:39:15+00:00,7214,Why exactly are overweight people at higher risk when they get infected with COVID-19?,Aglavra,"I have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19. I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19. (It's just curiousity, I'll continue to follow social distancing and other rules in any case.)

Edit: Thanks for all the answers, I totally didn't expect the post to blow up. Now I have much to read, thanks to all people willing to explain. (And to some kind strangers for the awards). 

And huge respect to AskScience moderators for clearing all these ""because fat is bad"" useless and/or insulting answers, that I see in mobile notifications. 

And yes, I understand that being overweight or obese is unhealthy in general, no need to remind me about this. My question was about that particular case with covid-19. More detailed understanding of how it works, helps me to stay motivated. (The covid threat wasn't the main reason for my desire to lose weight, I have many other inner and outer reasons for that. It just happened that staying at home on lockdown helped me to start eating healthier and working out more regularly).",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/juqulz/why_exactly_are_overweight_people_at_higher_risk/,askscience,764,4.0

Ask us anything!",AskScienceModerator,"Join us at today at 1 p.m. ET (17 UT) to ask anything about NASA's New Horizons mission! In July 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to explore Pluto and its moons. Recently, the spacecraft - which is more than four billion miles from home and speeding toward interstellar space - took images of the stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 from its unique vantage point in deep space. Scientists combined these images with pictures of the same stars taken near the same time from Earth, creating stereo images that instantly demonstrate the parallax effect astronomers have long used to measure distances to stars. New Horizons is humankind's farthest photographer, imaging an alien sky. Why does New Horizons ""see"" these stars in a different place in the sky than on Earth? How are these images sent back from New Horizons? How long does it take the team on the ground to send commands to the spacecraft? Where is New Horizons headed next?

2020-06-08 23:35:16+00:00,14987,Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,throwaway63257,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

It spreads through the air. Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

I just published a paper in Nature Biotechnology entitled ""[Genomic and phenotypic analyses of six offspring of a genome-edited hornless bull](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0266-0)"". For the past two years, my laboratory and collaborators have been studying six offspring of a dairy bull, genome-edited to prevent it from growing horns. This technology has been proposed as an alternative to dehorning, a common management practice performed to protect other cattle and human handlers from injuries. We found that none of the bull's offspring developed horns, as expected, and blood work and physical exams of the calves found they were all healthy. We also sequenced the genomes of the calves and their parents and analyzed these genomic sequences. Our study found that two calves inherited the naturally-occurring hornless allele, and four calves additionally inherited a fragment of bacterial DNA, known as a plasmid. This study has generated some media interest, and I am here to answer questions about the study, and genome editing more generally.

On a personal note I'm originally from Australia where I completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at The University of Melbourne, before completing my Masters and Ph.D. in Genetics at UC Davis.

My research focuses on a special class of neutron stars called millisecond pulsars. 

Yesterday, a paper I led along with my colleagues\* in the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves ([NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org/)) collaboration was published in Nature Astronomy. It details our measurement of what is very likely the most massive neutron star ever detected. The source, called J0740+6620, weighs in at 2.14 solar masses. 

In short, this result was obtained by observing a general relativistic effect called [Shapiro delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_time_delay) in a pulsar-white dwarf binary system with the [Green Bank](https://greenbankobservatory.org/) telescope, and combining that data with five years of NANOGrav observations of the pulsar. No other neutron stars have measured masses that exceed 2 solar masses outside their 1-sigma confidence intervals, so we're really excited about this result! The main motivation behind these kinds of measurements is to constrain the very poorly understood neutron star [equation of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state).

My question then is, how would two moons (for argument's sake let's say of relatively equal mass and rotational period) impact the tides and the currents?

Imagine this: A patient gets a traumatic head injury, causing swelling. Some inflammation is necessary for healing, but too much can cause brain damage. The typical approach today is to administer drugs to control the swelling, but there's no way to know the perfect dose and the drugs often cause inflammation to plummet so low that it impedes healing.

With LOCKR (stands for Latching Orthogonal Cage Key pRoteins), you could create ""smart"" cells programmed to sense inflammation and respond automatically to maintain a desired level - not too high, not too low, but enough to maximize healing without causing permanent damage. BTW, we've made the system freely available to all academics, you can access the blueprints [here].

Ask Us Anything!,AskScienceModerator,"We are Dhruv Bhatnagar, Research Engineer, Patrick Balducci, Economist, and Bo Saulsbury, Project Manager for Environmental Assessment and Engineering, and we're here to talk about pumped-storage hydropower.

""Just-in-time"" electricity service defines the U.S. power grid. That's thanks to energy storage which provides a buffer between electric loads and electric generators on the grid. This is even more important as variable renewable resources, like wind and solar power, become more dominant. The wind does not always blow and the sun does not always shine, but we're always using electricity. 

Pumped storage hydropower is an energy storage solution that offers efficiency, reliability, and resiliency benefits. Currently, over 40 facilities are sited in the U.S., with a capacity of nearly 22 GW. The technology is conceptually simple - pump water up to an elevated reservoir and generate electricity as water moves downhill - and very powerful. The largest pumped storage plant has a capacity of 3 GW, which is equivalent to 1,000 large wind turbines, 12 million solar panels, or the electricity used by 2.5 million homes! This is why the value proposition for pumped storage is greater than ever.

My PhD research at the University of Florida is focused on the food web that lives inside the leaves of a carnivorous pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea).  Florida is the carnivorous plant hotspot of North America; however, this particular pitcher plant is unique, as it relies on a community of aquatic micro-organisms to help decompose its prey and acquire important nutrients for growth.

I use this model food web to ask a number of questions about ecological communities:  which organisms are there, how do they interact, and how does this composition and structure vary across different ecological and environmental conditions?  I'm particularly interested in the role of nutrients and predation on structuring aquatic communities.

I'm from Michigan, and first began doing research on aquatic communities in the Great Lakes region, where I spent many hours on a microscope!  I worked as a technician to sample and identify zooplankton taxa in a variety of habitats.  For my Master's research, I investigated the feeding ecology of an aquatic invasive species to the Great Lakes region, the bloody red shrimp.

When I'm not doing science, my other interests include teaching, reading, gardening (including a mini pitcher plant bog!), traveling, and hiking.

Why are cephalopods amazing? Let us count the ways: 

+ They have huge brains, and are capable of learning and retaining information 
+ They can morph texture, body shape, and color in the blink of an eye
+ They carry 2/3 of their neurons in their arms, proving that intelligence can develop in different ways 

My name is Roger Hanlon, and I'm a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. I am a diving biologist who studies cephalopod behavior, especially camouflage &amp; signaling.

My favorite cephalopod is Octopus cyanea, the ""day octopus"" of coral reefs throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This critter is really clever and adaptable, and its coloration for camouflage and signaling is amazing even by cephalopod standards.

I'm Mike Vecchione, a NOAA scientist at the National Museum of Natural History. My current research focuses on the natural history of cephalopods, and marine biodiversity, especially in the deep sea. I have helped to make cephalopod information available on the web [here](http://tolweb.org/cephalopoda). My favorite cephalopod is any strange species from the deep sea because we are still discovering new stuff regularly.

I wrote a book called *The War for Kindness* (it comes out next week on **June 4**), which shares stories and research about how to fight for empathy even when it feels impossible to some days.

Empathy is in short supply. Isolation and tribalism are rampant. We struggle to understand people who aren't like us, but find it easy to hate them. Studies show that we are less caring than we were even thirty years ago. In 2006, Barack Obama said that the United States is suffering from an ""empathy deficit"". Since then, things only seem to have gotten worse.  

It doesn't have to be this way. In my book, I share my research, including experiments from my own lab, showing that empathy is not a fixed trait - something we're born with or not - but rather a skill that can be strengthened through effort. There are stories of people who embody this new perspective, fighting for kindness in the most difficult of circumstances. We meet a former neo-Nazi who is now helping extract people from hate groups, ex-prisoners discussing novels with the judge who sentenced them, Washington police officers changing their culture to decrease violence among their ranks, and NICU nurses fine-tuning their empathy so that they don't succumb to burnout.

We've made significant progress in understanding the brain, and we believe our research offers opportunities to advance the state of AI and machine learning. 

Despite the fact that scientists have amassed an enormous amount of detailed factual knowledge about the brain, how it works is still a profound mystery. We recently published a paper titled [A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00121/full) that lays out a theoretical framework for understanding what the neocortex does and how it does it. It is commonly believed that the brain recognizes objects by extracting sensory features in a series of processing steps, which is also how today's deep learning networks work. Our new theory suggests that instead of learning one big model of the world, the neocortex learns thousands of models that operate in parallel. We call this the [Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence](https://numenta.com/blog/2019/01/16/the-thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence/).

We developed a simulation model, called NarcoLogic, that found the result of the 'cat-and-mouse' game of narco-trafficking and counterdrug interdiction strategies is a larger geographic area for trafficking with little success in stopping the drug from reaching the United States. In reality, narco-traffickers respond to interdiction by adpating their routes and modes of transit, adjusting their networks to exploit new locations. The space drug traffickers use, known as the 'transit zone', has spread from roughly 2 million square miles in 1996 to 7 million square miles in 2017. As a result, efforts by the United States to curtail illegal narcotics from getting into the country by smuggling routes through Central America over the past decades have been costly and ineffective.

The model provides a unique virtual laboratory for exploring alternative interdiction strategies and scenarios to understand the unintended consequences over space and time.

Our paper describes the model, its performance against historically observed data, and important implications for U.S. drug policy: [https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1812459116](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1812459116).

2019-04-02 11:00:20+00:00,3079,"AskScience AMA Series: Hi! We're Drs. Rebecca Schmidt from UC-Davis, and Cindy Lawler, from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of NIH, and we work on how environmental factors can increase risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Ask us anything!",AskScienceModerator,"Today is the 12th annual World Autism Awareness Day. In honor of that, we're here to answer your questions about how our environment can influence risk of developing Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD, in our most vulnerable population -- our children.

[Autism](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/autism/index.cfm) encompasses a group of complex disorders involving brain development. Autism symptoms appear very early in childhood and include difficulties in social communication as well as restricted patterns of behavior and interests. Once considered rare, current estimates indicate that autism affects about one in 59 children in the United States.

Scientists now know that ASD is most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, supports autism research aimed at understanding how environmental exposures early in life may combine with genetic susceptibility to alter brain development to create the core symptoms of autism. One way we do that is to support researchers, like Dr. Schmidt, on her work focusing on maternal folic acid intake during pregnancy.

Her research has found that maternal folic acid, the synthetic form of folate, is one of the first modifiable factors identified to date with the potential to reduce occurrence of ASD by 40 percent if taken near conception. Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to ASD. Further, her  provide evidence that folic acid supplements near conception might counter risk associated with gestational environmental contaminant exposures, like [pesticides](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Combined+Prenatal+Pesticide+Exposure+and+Folic+Acid+Intake+in+Relation+to+Autism+Spectrum+Disorder), [air pollution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Joint+effects+of+prenatal+air+pollutant+exposure+and+maternal+folic+acid+supplementation+on+risk+of+autism+spectrum+disorder), and [phthalates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Prenatal+exposure+to+phthalates+and+autism+spectrum+disorder+in+the+MARBLES+study).

Her [recent work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Association+of+Maternal+Prenatal+Vitamin+Use+With+Risk+for+Autism+Spectrum+Disorder+Recurrence+in+Young+Siblings) shows that taking prenatal vitamins that contain folic acid in the first month of pregnancy is also associated with reduced recurrence of autism by about half in younger siblings of children with autism who are at higher risk due to shared genetics and environment. She is also looking at potential ways that folic acid might protect against autism. There are many ways the many nutrients in prenatal vitamins could be critical for brain development and could protect mechanistic pathways implicated in autism, such as epigenetics, DNA repair/synthesis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Dr. Schmidt hopes that future research to understand the pathways involved could improve our understanding of autism etiology.

Dr. Schmidt is also helping to lead the [NIEHS-funded Markers of Autism Risk in Babies (MARBLES) study](https://health.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/research/marbles/index.html), which is a longitudinal study for pregnant women who have a biological child with ASD. The MARBLES study, which began in 2006, investigates possible prenatal and postpartum biological and environmental exposures and risk factors that may contribute to the development of autism.

Ask us anything about Dr. Schmidt's research on folic acid, the MARBLES study, or other NIEHS-funded research on the environmental risk factors of ASD!

AMA!",AskScienceModerator,"I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center.

We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.


I'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!

My lab is building more efficient CRISPR-based gene editing tools to supercharge the human immune system to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity. AMA!",AskScienceModerator,"Genetic engineering is now cheap, relatively simple, and pretty reliable - at least when done in a lab setting. Using a tool called CRISPR, researchers can access DNA in live cells, target specific strings of the DNA code to slice out, turn gene expression up or down, or even swap in new DNA. This means we can, theoretically, reverse genetic conditions, modify cell behaviors, and perhaps program the cells to better fight against disease.

If you want an overview on CRISPR and how it works, my university created this animated explainer: [https://youtu.be/iXgU--ugLqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXgU--ugLqY)

My lab is using CRISPR to better understand how the genome controls the functions of human immune cells, in health and disease. We hope to use this research to inform future cell-based therapies to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.

If you're deeply interested in CRISPR, you may have heard of our recent work - we discovered a way to make CRISPR more efficient and flexible in re-writing long DNA sequences in human immune cells, without the use of viruses. There are currently FDA approved gene engineered T cell therapies for certain types of cancer. These cells have been generated by using modified viruses to deliver genes into haphazard sites in the T cell genomes. Improved non-viral CRISPR delivery allows us, effectively, to paste long new stretches of DNA sequences into specific sites in the genome, without having to rely viruses that are costly and laborious to employ. We are working to develop non-viral CRISPR-based genome targeting into broadly useful platforms to make better, faster, cheaper engineered T cells for the next generation of immunotherapies.

The two of us study data compression algorithms, and we think it's time to come up with a new compression scheme-one that's vastly more efficient, faster, and better tailored to work with the unique characteristics of genomic data.

Typically, a DNA sequencing machine that's processing the entire genome of a human will generate tens to hundreds of gigabytes of data. When stored, the cumulative data of millions of genomes will occupy dozens of exabytes.

Researchers are now developing special-purpose tools to compress all of this genomic data. One approach is what's called reference-based compression, which starts with one human genome sequence and describes all other sequences in terms of that original one. While a lot of genomic compression options are emerging, none has yet become a standard.

Finally, we in [Sculpting Evolution](http://www.sculptingevolution.org/) try to carefully consider our [moral obligations](https://leapsmag.com/when-are-we-obligated-to-edit-wild-creatures/) and publicly [admit mistakes](https://www.responsivescience.org/pub/aotearoa-amends).

There's a lot of talk about autism in children, but not as much about autism among adults.  That's why we just launched this new academic journal. Our goal is to cover the most pressing issues affecting autistic adults, from emerging adulthood to later life. I am particularly excited about including autistic adults in our new journal - as editorial board members, authors, reviewers and readers. As a doctor and a services researcher, my own research is focused on how people on the autism spectrum can get better access to health care services. Many autistic adults don't get the health care they need, resulting in more health problems and shorter life expectancy.

This has always confused me. Where do our anglicanized names like these come from and how confident are we that this is what these historical and mythological figures were called by ancient peoples?

****

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

I am not sure wether this is the correct place to ask this question but here goes.
Does the force of gravity travel at the speed of light? 

I have read some articles that we haven't confirmed this experimentally.
If I understand this correctly newtonian gravity claims instant force..
So that's a no-go.
Now I wonder how accurate relativistic calculations are and how much room they allow for deviations.( 99%c for example)
Are we experiencing the gravity of the sun 499 seconds ago? 


Edit:

Sorry , i did not mean the force of gravity but the gravitational waves .

I am sorry if I upset some people asking this question, I am just trying to grasp the fundamental forces as we understand them.

We report for the first time that 1) neurons and glia in such cultures could be induced to express the reporter gene LacZ after transduction with adeno-associated viral vectors and 2) cytochrome oxidase activity could be enhanced by the addition of pyruvate to the medium.

Ask me anything!",AskScienceModerator,"Under the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the world has agreed to do what is needed to keep global temperatures from not rising above 2 degrees C as compared to pre-industrial levels. According to the International Panel on Climate Change, in every economically viable scenario to that goal, the world needs to deploy carbon-capture technologies on large scale.

These technologies allow us to keep burning fossil fuels almost without emissions, while putting us on the trajectory to hit our climate goals. They are considered a bridge to a future where we can create, store, and supply all the world's energy from renewable sources. But carbon-capture technologies have a tortured history. Though first developed nearly 50 years ago, their use in climate-change mitigation only began in earnest in the 1990s and scaling them up hasn't gone as planned. 

My initial perception, based on what I had read in the press, was that carbon capture seemed outrageously expensive, especially when renewable energy is starting to get cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels. At the same time, my training in chemical engineering and chemistry told me the technologies were scientifically sound. And some of world's most important bodies on climate change keep insisting that we need carbon capture. Who should I believe?

The question took me down a rabbit hole. After a year of reporting, I've come to a conclusion: Carbon capture is both vital and viable. I've ended up writing nearly 30,000 words in The Race to Zero Emissions series for Quartz. 

You can read the 8,000-word story where I lay the case for the technology here: https://qz.com/1144298; other stories from the series here: https://qz.com/re/the-race-to-zero-emissions/; and follow the newsletter here: https://bit.ly/RacetoZeroEmissions.

Ask Us Anything!,AskScienceModerator,"Atomic clocks are among the most precise scientific instruments ever made, and play an important role in advanced navigation, secure communication, and radar technology. Kyriakos Porfyrakis and Edward Laird of the University of Oxford are working on building a hyperprecise atomic clock that could fit on a chip inside a smartphone.

They begin with a nitrogen atom, which resonates at a particular frequency and acts as a very precise reference point by which to track time. Since nitrogen is highly reactive, they have to trap the nitrogen atom inside of an endohedral fullerene-a sort of atomic cage made out of 60 carbon atoms-in their lab. To do it, they used a process called ion implantation. This process produces a molecule called N@C_60 that can easily be collected and stored (they even sell it for £200 million per gram).

But before they could put the molecule in a clock, they also had to figure out how to cancel out magnetic fields from the surrounding environment that could disrupt the energy level of the nitrogen atom within. Earlier this year, they developed a way to shield the nitrogen atom from external magnetic fields by applying a steady magnetic field that would cancel out any effects.

They recently wrote about their work for IEEE Spectrum (https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/to-build-the-worlds-smallest-atomic-clock-trap-a-nitrogen-atom-in-a-carbon-cage).

They'll be here starting 12 PM ET (17 UT). You can ask them about GPS, atomic clocks, nanomaterials, or anything else!

2017-11-09 12:00:08+00:00,3875,AskScience AMA Series: We are climate scientists here to talk about the important individual choices you can make to help mitigate climate change. Ask us anything!,AskScienceModerator,"Hi! We are Seth Wynes and Kimberly Nicholas, authors of a recent scientific study that found the four most important choices individuals in industrialized countries can make for the climate are not being talked about by governments and science textbooks. We are joined by Kate Baggaley, a science journalist who wrote about in [this story](http://nbcnews.to/2AjqKSL)

Individual decisions have a huge influence on the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere, and thus the pace of climate change. Our research of global sustainability in Canada and Sweden, compares how effective 31 lifestyle choices are at reducing emission of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. The decisions include everything from recycling and dry-hanging clothes, to changing to a plant-based diet and having one fewer child.
 
The findings show that many of the most commonly adopted strategies are far less effective than the ones we don't ordinarily hear about. Namely, having one fewer child, which would result in an average of 58.6 metric tons of CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions for developed countries per year. The next most effective items on the list are living car-free (2.4 tCO2e per year), avoiding air travel (1.6 tCO2e per year) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e per year). Commonly mentioned actions like recycling are much less effective (0.2 tCO2e per year). Given these findings, we say that education should focus on high-impact changes that have a greater potential to reduce emissions, rather than low-impact actions that are the current focus of high school science textbooks and government recommendations.
 
The research is meant to guide those who want to curb their contribution to the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, rather than to instruct individuals on the personal decisions they make. 
 
Here are the published findings: [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta)

What determines this in a plant?

EDIT: I'm going to make a TL/DR so you can get a sum of the thread in one spot without reading all the comments. **HOWEVER** please take the time to read if you can, especially if you want more information. Shoutout to /u/bbrhuft, /u/urbanek2525, /u/tea_and_biology, /u/genius_retard, and anyone else who I may have forgotten. 

Thread TL/DR: There are two different paths that a plant can take to photosynthesize: C3 and **C4**. C4 is more efficient at doing this, so the best plants for getting that carbon out of the atmosphere would be something that goes through this pathway. A good common example is a **grass** or **bamboo**.

A fast-growing plant like grass (bamboo) or algae will go through this process the fastest, but to keep the carbon locked away, it requires a fair amount of upkeep. You can't just bury the freshly cut plant because it will create methane. You will have to essentially ""burn"" it in an oxygen-free environment, creating charcoal, and then bury it away to keep that carbon out of the atmosphere (Shockingly, I didn't think of this before. Reverse the use of charcoal by... creating charcoal and burying it). The alternative to this would be planting a tree. As long as the tree is not burned, it will keep the carbon stored for a long time, with very little human input. 

This will do nothing for pollution because they aren't exactly related. One is air quality and the particles in it, one is CO2. For air quality, NASA has done a [study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study) on that topic, and has a chart of good plants to keep in your house. Top two are the peace lily and chrysanthemums, but both of them are toxic to pets. If you have a furry friend, bamboo palm is a good option.

2017-10-09 12:00:37+00:00,2047,AskScience AMA Series: We are a plant ecology research lab working on the fate of abandoned cranberry bogs. Ask Us Anything!,AskScienceModerator,"Hi Reddit!

We are a plant ecology research lab at Monmouth University. We recently conducted a study investigating community succession after abandonment in abandoned cranberry bogs within the New Jersey Pinelands. Since the 1860's, the cultivation of the native American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been a major agricultural practice in the New Jersey pinelands. The pinelands have been well suited for cranberry production due to the sandy, organically rich soil and abundant sources of freshwater. Although cranberry agriculture can represent over a third of wetlands in the pinelands, the industry has been on the decline as it has moved to other regions of the country. As a result, many bogs have been abandoned. The effects of abandonment have not been investigated thoroughly. 

In this study, we explored the fate of bogs and examined bog succession after abandonment from time zero (an active cranberry bog) to 60 years abandoned in flooded and unflooded communities. A full inventory of plant and invertebrate species were collected from cranberry bogs of different ages from three locations. Community diversity and structure were determined from the inventories and a chronosequence for bog succession was developed. When a cranberry bog was left to dry, conversion from a wet savanna to either a mesic mixed forest or wooded swamp was observed. A cranberry bog that remained flooded transitioned to a lake, spung, or pond. With this information, recommendations can be made onto how the lands should be managed in the future in order to maintain healthy and native communities.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72oipy/why_do_we_consider_it_certain_that_radioactive/dnk9sjq/?context=3) explains that the theories that seem to be the most accurate when tested describes quantum mechanics as inherently random/probabilistic.

very intuitively easy to understand. It also took me to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory) page on wikipedia which seems almost made for the question I asked. So I think everyone else wondering the same thing I did will find it useful!

ReLU are now standard because they work but I have not been shown an explanation why.

Sigmoid and tanh seem to no longer be in favor due to staturation killing the gradiant back propagation. Adding a small linear term should fix that issue. You lose the nice property of being bounded between -1 and 1 but ReLU already gives that up.

Tanh(x)+0.1x has a nice continuous derivative. 1-f(x)^2 +0.1 and no need to define things piecewise. It still has a nice activation threshold but just doesn't saturate.

Sorry if this is a dumb idea. I am just trying to understand and figure someone must have tried something like this.

EDIT

Thanks for the responses. It sounds like the answer is that some of my assumptions were wrong.

1. Looks like a continuous derivative is not that important. I wanted things to be differential everywhere and thought I had read that was desirable, but looks like that is not so important.
2. Speed of computing the transfer function seems to be far more important than I had thought. ReLU is certainly cheaper.
3. Things like SELU and PReLU are similar which approach it from the other angle. Making ReLU continuous rather than making something like tanh() fixing the saturation/vanishing grad issues . I am still not sure why that approach is favored but probably again for speed concerns.

I will probably end up having to just test tanh(x)+cx vs SELU, I will be surprised if the results are very different. If any of the ML experts out there want to collaborate/teach a physicist more about DNN send me a message. :)

Our website (http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/) describes more of what we do and how to contact us. Its been a few years since our last AMA, but we're back to answer your questions about astronomy and the Universe! 

Answering questions tonight are 11 graduate students:

* Cristobal Armaza- My main interests orbit around theoretical astrophysics. Currently, I work on the implementation of a new code to solve the equations of hydrodynamics in astrophysical contexts.
* Paul Corlies- I study planetary atmospheres (clouds, hazes, etc), ground based observing, and solar system satellite development/instrumentation
* Dylan Cromer- I am interested in cosmology, specifically relating cosmological tests of dark matter and modified gravity theories by examining data from surveys of the cosmic microwave background.	
* Andrew Foster - Planetary and Exoplanetary science, with a focus on atmospheres. Specifically, using radiative transfer to probe atmospheric structure and the composition of atmospheres and clouds. Also interested in chemistry and astrobiology.
* Avani Gowardhan- I study how supermassive black holes impact the growth and star formation in their host galaxies in the local universe
* Matt Hankins- I study massive stars and star formation in the Galactic center using infrared observations from NASA's SOFIA mission (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/index.html). 
* Thea Kozakis- I study the environments of Earth-like planets orbiting newly born and dying stars and their atmospheres.  I mainly work on computer models to determine potential habitibility of planets
* Cody Lamarche- I study the interstellar medium in high-redshift galaxies to learn about star formation and supermassive black hole growth at a time when the universe was less than half its current age.
* Jack Madden- I study the climate and habitability of exoplanets using computer models.
* Ishan Mishra- I am interested in studying planetary science, exoplanets and habitability.
* Christopher Rooney- I study the movement of galaxies through the universe, though I'm interested in many different topics in astronomy
* Akshay Suresh- I am interested in studying stellar and planetary magnetic fields.

Well I was thinking is this somehow a linear capability. Say we have an Uranium atom orbiting an Earth mass black hole 2cm above the event horizon. Ignoring time diliation, would the Uranium be more likely to give up a helium nucleus (alpha decay) due to the nucleus being pulled apart by the black holes tidal force?

Surely that is enough to ensure pretty much negligable amounts of carbon on earth. According to wikipedia, 1-1.5 per 10^12 cabon atoms are carbon 13 or 14.

So if this is the case for something with a half life as long as carbon 14, then how the hell are their still radioactive elements/isotopes on earth with lower half lives? How do we still pick up trace, but still appreciable, amounts of radioactive elements/isotopes on earth?

Is it correct to assume that no new radioactive particles are being produced on/in earth? and that they have all been produced in space/stars? Or are these trace amount replenished naturally on earth somehow?

I recognize that the math checks out, and that we should still be picking up at least some traces of them. But if you were to look at it from the perspective of a individual Cesium or Phosphorus-32 atoms it seems so unlikely that they just happen to survive so many potential opportunities to just decay and get entirely wiped out on earth.

I get that radioactive decay is asymptotic, and that theoretically there should always be SOME of these molecules left, but in the real world this seems improbable. Are there other factors I'm missing?

In the first part of the decay a neutron is fired into a nucleus the decays and produces 2 daughter nuclei and some other emitted neutrons. 
We include these in the binding energy calculations. 

After this the two daughter nuclei decay via beta emission.  Producing emitted electrons.
We don't include these in the calculations

When I say calculations mean using binding energies and mass difference.

In both cases the particles are emitted and not part of a nucleus. 
Is it because the neutrons have nuclear forces between the quarks inside them?

Is it because the neutrons were initially a part of the nucleus? But then what about neutrons that are fired into the nucleus?

Ask Us Anything!,AskScienceModerator,"Check out this short animation about the music of the TRAPPIST-1 planets: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i8Urhbd6eI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i8Urhbd6eI)

TRAPPIST-1 is a prime candidate in the search for life beyond our solar system. It is one of the 300 closest stars to us, and hosts seven Earth-sized planets, several of which might have the right temperatures to host liquid water. It also has a remarkably precise orbital configuration. For every 2 times the outermost planet goes around the central star, the progressively interior planets each execute almost exactly 3, 4, 6, 9, 15 and 24 orbits. Such a long so-called resonant chain is unprecedented.

We recently translated these rhythmic planetary motions into music. We also assigned planets notes by scaling up their orbital frequencies into the human hearing range. The result is remarkably harmonious thanks to the near-perfect period ratios between planets. You can learn more and experience the awful cacophony generated by more normal systems at [http://www.system-sounds.com](http://www.system-sounds.com/).

One puzzle that has loomed since the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 is how such a tightly spaced system of planets can avoid destroying itself due to repeated gravitational tugs. Our research has revealed a solution that relies on the same harmonic pattern responsible for creating such beautiful music. 

Thought Cafe, the animation team behind the video is also joining us.

2017-05-07 12:42:42+00:00,9080,"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400°F, how is the earths core magnetic?",callmecraycray,"After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

Yet, if the brain hemispheres can not communicate directly, then in such cases, how does the coordination, or even the initiation of a gross action occur? Could it be like this:

Let's say there is a stimulus to run, e.g. a dinosaur comes chasing and both hemisphere fire, yet whichever side gets going first, the other side starts complementing it with a response that will keep the body balanced and running. E.g. If one side speeds up, the other either agrees and speeds up accordingly, or maybe it quarrels. But both sides know that it is in their interest to escape the velociraptor.  

Essentially, I'd guess that the hemispheres' coordination is via the feedback that they receive from the already effectuated actions of their other half. Maybe this occurs on a subconscious level for both sides? Anyways, if true, I can't understand how it doesn't lead to massive problems, e.g. you see your Ex and one side want's to interact and the other wants to walk off. On the other hand, does the operation enable legitimate multitasking?

 Here is a different [news source](https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/tech/extinct-creature-sightings-piling-australia-130041464.html) which I read a couple days ago that prompted me to think that the number of sightings have increased recently. 

In the article they mention several recent sightings and the fact that there is a team of scientists taking action to further investigate the claims.

More information on the scientists conducting the research can be found [here](https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2017/march/fnq-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger) in a media release from James Cook University. Dr. Sandra Abell and professor Bill Laurence will be leading a team of scientists that will be placing 50 wildlife cameras out in strategic locations to try to catch a glimpse of the creature. This is part of an already existing study that they were conducting to monitor wildlife that had been modified to focus on the Tasmanian Tigers following the credible sighting reports.

I haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves/veins/etc, and the spine. However to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent?

Edit: so this blue up quite a bit. For the record, I am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, I simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though.

I am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what I'm asking about.

It's relevant in for example the r^12 term in the [Lennard Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential#Explanation) and it supposedly [explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle#Stability_of_matter) why solid objects ""contact"" eachother in every day life. Pauli also explains [fucking magnets and how do they work](https://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/where-does-magnetism-come-from/), but I still have no idea what ""force"" is there to prevent electrons occupying the same state.

So what on earth is going on??


EDIT: Thanks everyone for some brilliant responses. It seems to me there are really two parts of this answer:

1) The higher energy states for the particle are simply the only ones ""left over"" in that same position of two electrons tried to occupy the same space. It's a statistical thing, not an actual force. Comments to this effect have helped me ""grok"" this at last.

By the way this one gives me new appreciation for why for example matter starts heating up once gravity has brought it closer together in planet formation / stars / etc. Which is quit interesting.

2) The spin-statistics theorem is the more fundamental ""reason"" the pauli exclusion principle gets observed. So I guess thats my next thing to read up on and try to understand.

context: never studied physics explicitly as a subject, but studied chemistry to a reasonably high level. I like searching for deeper reasons behind why things happen in my subject, and of course it's all down to physics. Like this, it usually turns out to be really interesing.

edit: 

Hello everyone, I appreciate all the feedback received from this post and I'm grateful for such well presented answers. I realise that this sort of question can raise many different answers due to the question being too general. 

But as I understand from most of the replies... The reason the light from those stars will never entirely vanish is because even when the star/galaxy passes the cosmological event horizon, the space between us and them is only expanding and so the light that was sent before the star/galaxy passing the cosmological event horizon will only stretch due to the expansion and continue to reach us but through other spectrums of light as it continues to redshift. Would this be correct? 

I would also like to bring forward a question that has been brought up by a few other redditors. However as it may seem there is no exact answer to it, I'd like to ask a question similar to it:

it seems like, in the reference frame of the person moving towards you, the wavelength would be different by a factor of 1/(1- v^(2)/c^2) so it would go from 3.2\*10^-35 m to 6.1\*10^-36 m. That would mean it was below the minimum wavelength though, so what would actually happen?

Ask us anything!",NOAAgov,"Hi Reddit! I’m NOAA Fisheries scientist Jamison Smith. I am the NOAA Fisheries National Entanglement Response Program Coordinator and I oversee NOAA’s whale entanglement response teams.  And I’m Ed Lyman, I serve as the large whale entanglement response coordinator for Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. 

Whales are becoming entangled in fishing gear and marine debris at an increasing rate and scientists are unsure why. Scar studies in U.S. waters show that 83 percent of all right whales and 70 percent of whales overall have been entangled in fishing gear or other marine debris at some point in their lives. Fortunately, the efforts of whale entanglement response teams are paying off. There are endangered North Atlantic right whales alive and reproducing today because of successful disentanglement efforts of NOAA Fisheries and our partners. 

Whale entanglement response teams must be available at a moment’s notice and they deal with a variety of cetacean species, from the largest to the smallest, in a range of different ocean and weather conditions. These teams are highly skilled and use specialized equipment to cut whales free from tangled lines, buoys, and other debris. They can also administer on-site medical care to treat wounds and promote continued recovery.
 
If you’re interested in whales and the people who spend their lives saving them, this is your chance to learn more. We’re here from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. ET today to answer your questions. Ask us anything!

Several medications can be used to reduce fever and/or inflammation, for example paracetamol (tylenol in the US) or NSAIDs (ibuprofen and others). But as I understood it, fever and inflammation are mechanisms the body uses to boost the effectiveness of the immune system. Does the use of medications therefore reduce the effectiveness of the immune system in combatting an infection?

Besides duration, and the ceiling of the painkilling effects (i.e. codeine vs. morphine), the differences are very slight between these drugs. In fact I believe only morphine makes the WHO's list of essential medicines for a healthcare system. Why bother stocking all the rest? 


Edit:To add to this, I'm mostly interested in what, if any, implications the often slight alterations in morphine's analogues have that make them more desirable than morphine itself. Primarily I'm interested in how these small changes effect a drug's structure-activity relationship. Opiates are really just an ideal example I picked, if you know something regarding this in other kinds of drugs, that's also of help.

2016-12-28 23:44:40+00:00,5196,Does this* number have a name?,nmhnmhnmhnmh,"I would be more specific in the title, but it would be too incomprehensible and cut-short probably. It will take some explanation before I get to my question again but it's there:

I was working on a math puzzle a while back where I had to guess the next number in a series. The given series was ""1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, __"" and I had to guess the last number. I guessed correctly, but instead of intuitively realizing that the pattern was "" x^2 "", I found the answer via another method.

I found the differences between the adjacent numbers in the series, i.e. 4 - 1 = 3, 9 - 4 = 5, so on, and used those to create a new series: ""3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13"". I then performed the same operation on that line, finding the differences between adjacent numbers and then using those to create a new line: ""2, 2, 2, 2, 2"".

I thought this was interesting, because by performing this differences method twice on my given series, I was able to bottom-out/hit a ceiling at the number 2*. The number 2 was useful, because I could then work my way back down/up (depends on how you write it down, I guess) to find the next number in the series: 64.

I decided to try this again on a new, related series. I made the series ""1, 8, 27, 64, 125"" ( x^3 ) and resolved to use the same differences method on this line. The first time yields: 7, 19, 37, 61""; the second time yields: ""12, 18, 24""; the third time bottoms out at: ""6, 6"".

So ( x^2 ) bottoms out at 2*, and ( x^3 ) bottoms out at 6*.

I continued this with ( x^4 ): ""1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401"". The differences method yields: ""15, 65, 175, 369, 671, 1105""; again, and it yields: ""50, 110, 194, 302, 434""; again, and it yields: ""60, 84, 108, 132""; again, and it yields: ""24, 24, 24"".

So ( x^4 ) bottoms out at 24*.

Finally, my question: Is there a name for these bedrock numbers that I've marked with the asterisks? 

Additionally, I would like to know: is there reading material on the matter? Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?

tl;dr:

2 underlies ( x^2 ),
6 underlies ( x^3 ),
24 underlies ( x^4 ),
and so on, for reasons explained above.

It's fairly common knowledge that carbon-14 dating relies on decay into nitrogen-14, but of course nitrogen and carbon have very different chemical properties. The half life of carbon-14 is very long, which means that the conversion of carbon to nitrogen doesn't happen at an appreciable rate, but nonetheless something has to happen to the molecules in which the carbon is located when it suddenly becomes a nitrogen atom. Has this been studied? Does the result vary for sp3, sp2, and sp hybridized carbons? Does the degree of substitution effect the resulting products (primary, secondary, and so on)?

What I'm wondering is at what distance do you consider something to be global rather than local? 

That might be a plain misunderstanding from my part, so alternatively, is it more correct that the local measurment is just an approximation of the global one, since we don't expect any significant space-time curvature in proximity of the measurment (and therefore, the measurment is actually a tiny bit inaccurate)?

Pigarev's theory that sleep is used by the brain to process input from internal organs?,gaga666,"TIL about Ivan Pigarev's [""visceral"" theory of sleep](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283492881_The_state_of_sleep_and_the_current_brain_paradigm). Basically it states that sleep is required to switch the brain from processing of data from external sensors (eyes, ears etc.) to internal ones, like receptors in intestines, and do the adjustments accordingly. In his works he shows that if one stimulates e.g. the intestine of a sleeping animal it causes the response in visual cortex which is very similar to the response to flickers of light during the day, whilst there is no such response in waking state. He states that they conducted hundreds of experiments on animals in support of the view.

This was completely new to me (which is to no surprise, I'm quite illiterate in neurophysiology) and I'm fascinated by the idea. The first thing I did is checked if his works are legit and if he has publications in respectable magazines, which he seem to have. He also doesn't look like a usual ""science freak"" which are plenty around here. However, I tried to google some popular articles in English about that but haven't found much.

So I want to know if this view is known to Western scientists and if yes what is the common opinion on that? Community's opinion on the matter would be also great to hear!

Ask me anything!,AskScienceModerator,"Hi, reddit! I'm Alan Eustace and I'm here with Jerry Kolber. We're the subject and director, respectively, of the documentary **14 MINUTES FROM EARTH**, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April of this year and was released On Demand this past Tuesday. Jerry's film documented the process by which I broke the world record for high-altitude jump in 2014 at the age of 57 when I dropped from a gas-powered balloon 135,000 feet above the earth. Check out the film's [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNsWPWbFRo)!

The plan began as a scribble on a paper napkin and took three years of working in secrecy to come to fruition. In 2011 I began working with Taber MacCallum and Jane Poynter, co-founders of [Paragon Space Development Corporation](http://www.paragonsdc.com/), to bring the plan to life. Because a private citizen cannot simply purchase a space suit from NASA, we also worked with [ILC Dover](http://www.ilcdover.com/), outfitters of every United States astronaut in the Apollo program.

Jerry Kolber, the film's Executive Producer and Director, is the co-creator and show runner of the Emmy-nominated series ""Brain Games"" on National Geographic, and has created, produced, and served as showrunner on many other award-winning scripted and un-scripted series. [Learn more about his work](http://thisisatomic.com/).

I often talk about bat papers because let's face it, bats are the most charismatic creatures on Earth. Did you know some bats feed on fish? Did you know there are bats with suction cups on their wrists and ankles? Did you know some bats perform oral sex on one another? I could go on. Oh wait, I will!

 Let's blab about bats. Also, I'll happily answer questions about other things, too, like what it's like to work on Monsters Inside Me (there's a new episode [tonight](https://www.facebook.com/MonstersInsideMe/)!), or about my experience doing the podcast. This will be my third AMA, and I hope it is just as fun as the last two. Coming on at noon (ET), bring it, Redditors.

2016-10-26 12:14:24+00:00,3386,"AskScience AMA Series: We are scientists with the Dog Aging Project, and we're excited to talk about improving the quality and quantity of life for our pets. Ask Us Anything!",AskScienceModerator,"Hello Reddit, we are excited to talk to you about the [Dog Aging Project](http://dogagingproject.com). Here to discuss your questions are:

* Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, Professor at the University of Washington Department of Pathology, co-director of the Dog Aging Project
* Dr. Daniel Promislow, Professor at the University of Washington Departments of Biology and Pathology, co-director of the Dog Aging Project
* Dr. Kate Creevy, Professor at Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences, lead veterinarian for the Dog Aging Project
* Dr. Silvan Urfer, Senior Fellow at the University of Washington Department of Pathology, veterinary informatics officer for the Dog Aging Project

Our goal is to define the biological and environmental factors that influence healthy aging in dogs at high resolution, and to use this information to improve the quality and quantity of life for our pets.  So far, most scientific research on the biology of aging (geroscience) has been conducted in the lab under standardized conditions. Results from these studies have been quite encouraging (for example, Matt's group has recently managed to extend life expectancy in middle-aged mice by 60%). We believe that the domestic dog is ideally suited to bring this work out of the lab and into the real world.  There are many reasons why dogs are uniquely suited for this effort, including that they share our environment, receive comparable medical care, are affected by many of the same age-related diseases, and have excellent health and life span data available.

While aging is not a disease, it is the most important risk factor for a wide range of diseases such as cancer, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, kidney failure and so on. Therefore, by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging, we can expect to see benefits across the spectrum of those otherwise unrelated diseases - which has lead us to state that healthy aging is in fact *The Ultimate Preventive Medicine.*

Our hope is that by understanding the biological and environmental factors that influence the length of time an individual lives in good health (what we call 'healthspan'), we can better understand how to maximize each individual dog's healthspan. Having dogs live and stay healthy for longer will be beneficial for both the dogs and their owners. Moreover, given that dogs live in the same environment as we do, what we learn about healthspan in dogs is likely to apply to humans as well – so understanding healthy aging in dogs might help us to learn how to ensure the highest level of health at old age for humans. 

We welcome interested citizen scientists to sign up their dogs to be considered for [two studies](http://dogagingproject.com/project-details/):

* *The Longitudinal Study* will study 10,000 dogs (our 'foundation cohort') of all breeds and ages throughout North America. This intensively studied cohort will be followed through regular owner questionnaires, yearly vet visits including bloodwork, and information about in-home behavior, environmental quality, and more. In a subset of these dogs (our 'precision cohort'), we will also include annual studies of state-of-the-art molecular biology ('epigenome', 'microbiome' and 'metabolome') information. Our goal is to better understand how biology and the environment affect aging and health. Results from this study should help us to better predict and diagnose disease earlier, and so improve our ability to treat and prevent disease. There are no health, size or age requirements for dogs to be eligible to participate in this study.
* *The Interventional Study* will test the effects of a drug called rapamycin on healthspan and lifespan in dogs. This is a drug that has shown promising effects on aging in a wide variety of species, and based on those results we expect to see a 2 to 5 year increase in healthy lifespan in dogs. We have previously tested rapamycin in a pilot study on healthy dogs for 10 weeks and found improved heart function that was specific to age-related changes, and no significant adverse side effects. For the Interventional Study, we will treat 300 healthy middle-aged dogs with either rapamycin or a placebo for several years and compare health outcomes and mortality between the two groups. To be eligible to participate, dogs will need to be healthy, at least six years of age at the beginning of the study, and weigh at least 18 kg (40 lbs). 

The Dog Aging Project believes in the value of *Open Science*. We will collect an enormous amount of data for this project - enough to keep scores of scientists busy for many years. Other than any personal information about owners, we will make all of our data publicly available so that scientists and veterinarians around the world can make discoveries. We are also dedicated to Citizen Science, and will endeavor to create ways for all dog owners to become a part of the process of scientific discovery as the Dog Aging Project moves forward.

We'll be on at noon pacific time (3 PM ET, 19 UT), ask us anything!

2016-10-22 12:59:38+00:00,3000,Can we induce visual experiences in someone who has been blind from birth by stimulating their brain?,Laughing_Chipmunk,"I know we can induce visual experiences in people who already have a functional visual system, [for example, in this subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwOoqkLwL40), or those who had a functional visual system but lost some functionality due to disease or injury. However what I am unaware of, is if it's possible to induce visual experiences in individuals who have been blind from birth, e.g. those that have no eyes, via stimulating or inducing the relevant activity in their brain. 

Edit: The majority of responses seem to be missing the point of my question. Perhaps I was not specific enough. The question I was getting at is, what is necessary for the having of a visual experience? It is often said that we don't ""see"" with the eyes because for example one can have visual experiences by stimulating the visual cortex. So from that type of finding it would seem the necessary components, e.g. the neural circuitry, for inducing visual experiences are in the cortex. If that were the case, then in theory it should be possible to create the relevant activity, either by continued stimulation directly to the cortex to create the right circuitry which would then allow for the right kind of activity, or by stimulating the circuitry that is already there, to mimic the activation pattern that is taken to be the necessary component in the generation of a particular visual experience. That is why I asked if we can induce visual experiences in someone who has been blind from birth by stimulating their brain (should have specified cortex). Because if we can, then we really can discount pre-cortical processing in being necessary for the generation of visual experiences. This might prove to be more of a technical issue, especially [as we don't yet](http://www.nature.com.sci-hub.bz/nrn/journal/v17/n5/pdf/nrn.2016.22.pdf) have a detailed account of the activity that is at least sufficient to generate a visual experience. However, if it isn't possible to induce visual experiences directly in the cortex, in the absence of external input through the pathway of the retina -&gt; LGN etc., then pre-cortical processing might play a bigger role than is currently thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/58t0l2/can_we_induce_visual_experiences_in_someone_who/,askscience,205,

2016-10-13 01:59:03+00:00,2595,"Does the imaginary part of the voltage in an RLC circuit really exist, or is it just an artifact of the math we use to derive it that can be discarded? Is there any way to measure it?",craigdahlke,"So in my physics class that I took last semester we learned about RLC circuits and my teacher sort of handwaved away the imaginary part of the voltage, saying ""we only care about the real part."" Is this totally true or is there just a deeper rabbit hole he didn't want to get into for the purposes of our class?

If we have a capacitor, resistor, and inductor in series and in a closed loop with no external voltage source (for the purposes of this explanation, anyways.) We can use kirchoff's law to derive the fact that the voltage drop over any closed loop is zero, so we get:

&amp;nbsp;

-L(dI/dt)-IR-(R/C)=0

&amp;nbsp;

=-L(d^2 Q/dt^2 )-R(dQ/dt)-(Q/C)=0

&amp;nbsp;

=(d^2 Q/dt^2 )+(R/L)(dQ/dt)+(1/LC)Q=0

&amp;nbsp;

So now we have a differential equation, whose solution we can guess is something like : Q=Ae^iωt 

&amp;nbsp;

Therefore:

&amp;nbsp;

-ω^2 A^eiωt +iω(R/L)A^eiωt -(1/LC)A^eiωt =0

&amp;nbsp;

=-ω^2 +iω(R/L)-(1/LC)=0

&amp;nbsp;

Where (1/LC) is some resonant frequency ω*_0_* squared, so we can solve the quadratic:

&amp;nbsp;

-ω^2 +iω(R/L)-ω*_0_*^2 =0

&amp;nbsp;

to find ω, which will be:

&amp;nbsp;

ω=i(R/L)±sqrt(ω*_0_*^2 -(R^2 /4L^2 ))

&amp;nbsp;

[edit: i skipped some parts here, i'm just going off what i have in my notebook]

&amp;nbsp;

so finally Q=Ae^((-R/2L)^)t ^+iωt 

&amp;nbsp;

which is e to a complex power, which can be re-written using euler's formula, which gives a real and an imaginary part:

&amp;nbsp;

Q=Ae^((-R/2L)^)t cos(ωt)+Ae^((-R/2L)^)t isin(ωt)

&amp;nbsp;

so now for Q we have a real and imaginary part. So what does the imaginary part mean in reality? If we tried to see it on an oscilliscope, per se, could we? Could we have some sort of device that would measure charge or voltage in the complex plane? Or does none of this matter because the imaginary part is just an artifact of the mathematics that doesn't have any real meaning?

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

While I'm a layperson (biochemistry undergraduate student currently) I've thought of how prevalent mental disorders (seem) to be in humans. I've wondered if this is due to how complex our brains are, having to provide for rational thought, reasoning, intricate language etc. 

Essentially my back of the napkin theory is that our brains are so unimaginably complex, there has to be some mess ups along the way leading to mental disorders. Furthermore, I wonder if that other animals with brains not as complex as ours experience mental disorders less severely or not as often.

They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**To recap**

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

Christ this blew up over the week-end while I was away, I will try to read everything as soon as possible.

If not, he couldnt see them move normally, because he can observe them for 23 years, while they only ""do actions"" that take 3 hours.

I'm currently working to solve the second Aloe vera mystery: why has this species reached wonder-plant status, supporting a global trade, and not the 500 or so other closely related species in the genus Aloe?
 
The research goes beyond solving a botanical enigma. If we can understand how Aloe vera differs from its closest relatives (or not) then we can highlight other species of Aloe, growing throughout Africa, that might have similar potential.

Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?
 
A bit more about me: I’m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the [Duke Canine Cognition Center](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs), which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com), an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs.

So, I have lots of questions regarding this, many probably unanswerable.

Could it collide with the moon? How could this affect things like our tides?

How long has it been there? Could this arise in a matter of decades, or has it probably been there for centuries, millennia, or longer?

Could we land our own satellites on it and take advantage of its apparently rather stable orbit?
Would it be affecting our tides or weather at all?

Could we see it with the naked eye, or with any at-home tech, any time soon?

I presume it's unlikely to hit Earth anytime soon, looking at the article. How unlikely?

Could it be mined for minerals?

If anyone educated or experienced in anything related to this has any information, or even any guesswork, related to these questions, or even any more interesting info, I'd love to hear it :) I'm not used to being unable to google something and read pages of information on it, haha!

The oceans cover more than 70 percent of the planet and hold the key to many critical challenges facing science and society, from sustainably feeding human populations to addressing the impacts of climate change to protecting vulnerable marine species.

One of the cornerstone methods of keeping tabs on the oceans is through innovative tools and technologies to monitor them. At Scripps Oceanography we contribute to several ocean observation systems and networks that relay critical data about the seas and how they are changing. These include networks just off our populated coastlines (Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, (http://www.sccoos.org/)) for applications as diverse as marine operations, coastal hazards, and ecosystems, to far out at sea where it's not easy to access information (Argo, (http://argo.ucsd.edu/)) to help us understand phenomena such as El Niños and ocean warming.

I look forward to answering your questions about ocean observations between 12 and 1 EST on Tuesday, 21 June! Ask Me Anything!

But I was watching a neighbor pass by my house on a skateboard today, and I started wondering about the physics of it.  Obviously, he was moving between points A and B on his journey faster than he would be walking.  But then again, he also has to occasionally use one foot to push against the ground several times to keep the momentum of the skateboard moving forward at a higher speed than if he was just walking.

My question is basically is he ending up expending the SAME amount of total energy by the ""pushing"" of his one foot while using the skateboard as he would if he was just walking the same distance traveled using two feet?  

Assume all other things are equal, as in the ground being level in the comparison, etc.

My intuition says there is no such thing as a ""free energy lunch"".  That regardless of how he propels his body between two points, he would have to expend the same amount of energy regardless whether he was walking or occasionally pushing the skateboard with one foot.  But I'm not sure about that right now.  Are there any other factors involved that would change the energy requirement expended? Like the time vs distance traveled in each case? 

EDIT:  I flaired the question as Physics, but it might be an Engineering question instead.

EDIT 2:  Wow.  I never expected my question to generate so many answers.  Thanks for that.  I do see now that my use of the words ""energy expended"" should probably have been ""work done"" instead.

I want to know a) if interference requires sufficient dispersion for the wave to cover both slits and b) if the wave hitting a mirror (pre-slits) is a measurement-style interaction that causes its Gaussian to become fairly narrow/well localized again, which might prevent the wave from covering both slits.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4k8m2w/in_a_double_slit_experiment_is_there_a_minimum/,askscience,110,

At heart I am a paleoecologist, interested in fossil organisms as once living things inhabiting and interacting with each other and their environment. Currently I am an assistant professor in Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside.

**From Dr. Drumheller-Horton:** My research falls into two broad fields: taphonomy (the study of everything that happens to an organism from when it dies until when we find it) and crocodylian evolution/behavior. I am an assistant adjunct professor and lecturer in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee.

**Texas was a very different place 95 million years ago.** Dinosaurs and crocodiles dominated a lush coast, preserved as a rich fossil bed in Dallas-Forth Worth called the Arlington Archosaur Site (AAS). The AAS is an important, productive fossil locality that preserves a previously unknown fauna from this part of North America. 

The rocks here contain a rare record of ecosystem transition, when major groups of dinosaurs and other animals were changing significantly. The AAS preserves a nearly complete coastal ecosystem, providing an unparalleled glimpse into the life that existed here over 95 million years ago. Thousands of specimens have been recovered including previously unknown dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and plants. The diversity, abundance, and quality of the material is extraordinary. 

The site is run in partnership with amateur volunteers, creating a unique citizen-science initiative with far-reaching education opportunities for the surrounding community. You can find us on Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/Arlington-Archosaur-Site-188601874524788/)!

I know about how every atoms has its own emission spectrum -and absorption- and that sodium has a double spectral line around 589nm, which is in the 'orange part' of the visible spectrum, but I was wondering, why did we pick sodium and orange lightning specifically.

Was it for economical reasons ? Because Orange was a better choice for a reason I don't really get ?

2016-05-03 13:20:15+00:00,3064,How can a maglev train be energy efficient?,DrTobiasFunke23,"According to Wikipedia, the energy used to keep the train stable above the rails is small compared to the energy used to counteract drag. With an object as heavy as a train, how is this possible?

Edit: Since this thread has gone back and forth with different interpretations of the question, would anyone be willing to mathematically compare the amounts of energy required to accomplish the three goals of the maglev system (levitation, acceleration, and overcoming drag)? I think that would clear a lot of this up.

Edit 2: Now that more people have added their input, it looks like my initial assumption, that a continuous current requires a continuous input of energy, was wrong. The only energy required is the up-front energy to apply the initial voltage to the rails. After that, the circuit continues to run without the need for more energy. Thus, the only energy spent while the train is levitating (not including propulsion) is due to losses from resistance. With that in mind, and with the fact that no energy is required to suspend an object at a constant height, it makes sense that levitation is such a small portion of the energy used. As u/Wheed_O_Whirler pointed out, that amount is actually less energy than is used by the air conditioner.

I research malaria and the interactions between host and pathogens. I’m excited to talk to you about it. AMA!",CIDResearch,"Hello Reddit! 


My name is Alexis Kaushansky and I serve as a principal investigator at the Center for Infectious Disease Research. My research studies the interactions between humans and pathogens, with a particular focus on malaria. The malaria parasite and other infectious diseases that burden the world cannot survive independently. To cause sickness and travel through the population, they must appropriate resources from the people they infect. Our work aims to identify what pathogens need from their host and use this knowledge to prevent and ultimately eliminate malaria.


When malaria parasites are transmitted from mosquito to human, they are first deposited into the skin, then quickly travel to the liver. In the liver, each parasite replicates tens of thousands of times within the confines of a single hepatocyte, a cell in the liver. During this stage of infection, the parasite causes no clinical symptoms, yet elimination of the parasite in the liver prevents disease and transmission and can even elicit sterile immunity from subsequent infection. Our work focuses on the basic question of how the malaria parasite is able to modify its human liver environment in order to counteract host defenses and ensure for its own survival.


At CIDResearch, we breed thousands of research grade mosquitoes each week in order to power our bench research projects. Our work critically depends on malaria parasite infection in mosquitoes and production of sporozoites for lab experiments. We maintain state-of-the-art insectaries that breed and house Anopheles mosquitoes.


Here are a few of our recent publications:

We found that a laser system commonly used to kill brain tumors has an additional and significant benefit: It creates a temporary opening in the blood-brain barrier — a natural barrier that’s normally efficient at blocking out chemicals and bacteria — to allow the passage of chemotherapy and immunotherapy drugs into the brain, for up to six weeks. This discovery could lead to new treatment protocols for glioblastoma, a very aggressive brain cancer that’s highly resistant to standard treatment.

And because we use memory to envision the future, Alzheimer’s disease also takes away expectations, anticipation, and hope.
 
Nearly 25 years ago, on a trip to Colombia, Dr. Francisco Lopera introduced me a family he had been tracking for the previous decade. We began a collaboration to find the cause of their early onset dementia, which turned out to be Alzheimer’s disease, and to identify the mutation responsible for the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The mutation turned out to be the substitution of glutamic acid for an alanine at position 280 of the presenilin I gene. The large extended family that harbors this mutation consists of about 5000 people whose lineage can be traced to a single founder, probably a conquistador who came from Spain not long after Christopher Columbus. Those family members who harbor the mutation are genetically determined to get a particularly aggressive early onset form of Alzheimer’s disease with the first symptoms apparent by age 45. The hallmark amyloid begins to collect in the brain about a decade earlier. Recently, this large Colombian family has begun to participate in a clinical trial that is testing an antibody directed at amyloid in the hope that the drug can reduce the amyloid burden and retard disease progression.
 
This story and others related to Alzheimer clinical trials is the subject of a NOVA PBS documentary titled “Can Alzheimer’s Be Stopped?” produced by Sarah Holt. I hope you will be able to watch it on the evening of April 13 at 9/8c on PBS: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/alzheimers-be-stopped.html

The statement is found almost midway down the article.  What metallicity would be expected for a star a) of the Sun's age and b) of the Sun's type?  Is there any implication here?  E.g., Was the sun likely formed elsewhere in the galaxy, such as the galactic center, etc.

Wikipedia says:  ""Population I, or metal-rich stars, are young stars with the highest metallicity out of all three populations. The Earth's Sun is an example of a metal-rich star. These are common in the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy.""

So it's common to find young, metal-rich stars in the spiral arms.  The sun is located just outside of a spiral arm.  The sun is young and metal-rich.  So what exactly would make the sun's metallicity unusual?  It seems to be exactly what one would expect based on the sun's location and age...",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4efyu8/our_sun_is_unusually_metalrich_for_a_star_of_its/,askscience,802,

My research is about what happens to our memories when we cannot remember. When we experience memory loss, does it mean that these memories have been erased? Could it be that some memories exist in our brains but we are unable to find and recall them? These questions led me to study memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition to the impact AD has on our community, watching my own grandmother gradually forget drives me to the laboratory everyday with the hope that someday we will be able to help AD patients remember.


To study memory brain structures affected by AD, I use animal models that closely mimic the human condition. From patients, we know that initial stages of AD (known as “early AD”) are diagnosed when consecutive memory tests result in extremely poor performance. In particular, early AD patients seem to lose memories of events/episodes such as birthday parties, summer vacations with the family, high school reunions, etc. It has been assumed that early AD patients lose critical memory information and therefore cannot remember. My recent work (link to nature study: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17172) using animal models challenges this widely held assumption. Not only did we find that early AD mice still stored the supposedly lost memories, but we found a way to bring these memories back. Given this work, I believe that memory loss in early stages of AD is because patients are unable find and retrieve the information, rather than a permanent loss of memory information. 


Even though this particular work was done using animal models, I have hope that in the future we can learn more about retrieving lost memories in early AD patients. For a perspective on my recent work by expert memory researchers, go here (link to nature news and views: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature17312.html).

Ask me anything!",Thomas_Hartung,"Hi Reddit,

Making your skin cells think – researchers create mini-brains from donated skin cells. It sounds like science fiction, but ten years ago Shinya Yamanaka’s lab in Kyoto, Japan, showed how to make stem cells from small skin donations. Now my team at Johns Hopkins University is making little brains from them, modeling the first two to three months of brain development.
 

These cell balls are very versatile – we can study the effects of drugs or chemicals. This promises treatments for diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer or Multiples Sclerosis. But also the disturbance of brain development, for example leading to autism, can be studied.
 

And we can create these mini-brains probably from anybody. This opens up possibilities for personalized medicine. Cells from somebody with the genetic background contributing to any of these diseases can be invaluable to test the drugs of the future. Take autism – we know that neither genetics nor exposure to chemicals alone leads to the disease. Perhaps we can finally unravel this with mini-brains from the skin of autistic children? They bring the genetic background – the researchers bring the chemicals to test.
 

And the mini-brains are actually thinking. They fire electrical impulses and communicate via their normal networks, the axons and neurites. The size of a fly eye, they are just nicely visible. Most of the different brain cell types are present, not only various types of neurons. This is opening up for a more human-relevant research to study diseases and test substances
 

We’ve started to study viral infections, but stroke, trauma and brain cancer are now obvious areas of use.
 

We want to make available mini-brains by back-order and delivered within days by parcel service.  Nobody should have an excuse to still use the old animal models.
 

And the future? Customized brains for drug research – such as brains from Parkinson patients to test new Parkinson drugs. Effects of illicit drugs on the brain. Effects of flavors added to e-cigarettes? Screening to find chemical threat agents to develop countermeasures for terroristic attacks. Disease models for infections. The list is long.
 

And the ultimate vision? A human-on-chip combining different mini-organs to study the interactions of the human body. Far away? Models with up to ten organs are actually already on the way.

FAQ:

&gt; Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

&gt; How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

&gt; Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

&gt; Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

&gt; What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

&gt; How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

2016-02-10 12:21:44+00:00,3914,"AskScience AMA Series: I’m Dr. Julia Shaw, a memory scientist and criminal psychologist. I study how we create complex false memories. AMA!",Dr_Julia_Shaw,"** **8:10pm UTC. SIGNING OFF. It's been a blast! What a wonderful selection of insightful comments and questions. Consider me impressed and proud to be a Redditor. If you want more, tonight you can see me demonstrating my research in ""Memory Hackers"" on PBS at 8/9c. See you again for AMA round 2 when I launch my book ""The Memory Illusion"" in June!** **

Hi Reddit! 


I study how we can create incredibly detailed memories of things that never actually happened. In particular, I implant rich false memories of committing crime with police contact and other highly emotional autobiographical events. I thought I’d share my work with the community, since I’m an avid Redditor.


The technique I use in my research is essentially a combination of what's called “mis-information"" (telling people convincingly that something happened that didn’t) and an imagination exercise which makes a participant picture the event happening. The goal is to get my participants to confuse their imagination with their memory. I find, as do many other scientists who study memory, that it is often surprisingly easy to implant memories. All of my participants are healthy young adults, and in my last study 70% of them were classified as having formed these full false memories of crime by the end of the study. I am currently working on further research and analysis to see whether I can replicate this, since this success rate was incredibly high.


Last year some of this research, which I did with Stephen Porter at UBC, went viral. It was so amazing to see such a great reaction from the press and public. There really seems to be a thirst for wanting to understand our faulty memories. You can see my favourite write up of the research [here] (http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/how-did-researchers-convince-so-many-people-they-had-committed-a-violent-crime).  In “[Memory Hackers](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/memory-hackers.html),” a NOVA documentary airing tonight on PBS at 9pm Eastern time, you can actually see some real footage from the videos that I made during the interviews, which you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AxIGmjEP4).  
 

I actually have a whole book coming out this summer on memory hacking. It’s the first popular science book of it’s kind, and I’m super excited about it! If you find my research interesting you’ll definitely like the book. The book will be released in 8 languages (English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, Taiwanese, Chinese, and Japanese) and will be called “The Memory Illusion”. You can get preliminary information about it [here](http://www.drjuliashaw.com/the-memory-illusion.html).

What does the force acting on the body care about the speed at which the object is moving if it just wants to accelerate it another 10m/s? What am I missing here?

After surgical treatment, Elana used her computer skills to create a registry that could help researchers (including her own father, Sandy Simon, of The Rockefeller University) to deepen their understanding of the mysterious cancer that threatened her life. In 2014, Elana (then 18), Sandy, her surgeon and others published research in the journal Science ([link](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6174/1010.abstract)(. Their research suggested a mutation that leads to that cancer.

Today, Elana is a 20-year-old sophomore at Harvard University and vice president of the Fibrolamellar Registry ([link](http://fibroregistry.org/about)). She's been recognized by the White House, by science and medical communities, and local, national, and international media. She and her father want to spread the word about their research and answer any questions Reddit users might have. Ask them anything!

Does this mean that if we were to watch a star collapse into a black hole, we would forever see a frozen image of the surface of the star as it was when it crossed the event horizon? If so, how is this possible since in order for light to reach us, it needs to be emitted by a source, but the source is beyond the event horizon which no light can cross?

====================

Right now the land and ocean (over time) absorb about half of all CO2 emissions. But it’s not yet clear if that will keep up! The upcoming UN climate talks in Paris will focus on levels of human-caused emissions. We are focused on the natural response to rising emissions and how we can learn more about it.

We’ll be online from 3-4 pm EST today to answer questions about what NASA is doing to better understand how land and ocean ecosystems are responding to a warming planet and rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere — and what these ecosystem changes could mean for future climate change. Ask Us Anything!

Hi everyone! I am Natassa Romanou, an oceanographer at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. I work with climate models and observations and I am specifically interested in how oceans change under climate change and conversely, how oceans affect the global carbon cycle and therefore the rate at which Earth’s climate is changing. I am also involved in the planning of a very exciting NASA field campaign, EXPORTS, that will investigate the changes in ecosystems and carbon stocks and fluxes in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.

Hello all – I am Jeff Masek, a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland.  My scientific focus has been on understanding forest dynamics &amp; their role in the terrestrial carbon cycle using long time series of satellite data.   I also serve as the NASA Project Scientist for the Landsat program, which provides much of our global information on land use and land cover changes.  

Hi everybody on line. I'm David Schimel, a carbon scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. I look at how climate affects forest growth and loss using satellite and aircraft measurements an also measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. I work on NASA’s new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 mission that is giving us an entirely new way of understanding ecosystems and the carbon cycle.

My colleagues were advocating that one could not heat anything over 5778K with lenses and mirror, because that is the temperature of the radiating surface of the Sun.

I proposed that we could just think of the sunlight as a energy source, and with big enough lenses and mirrors we could reach high energy output to a small spot (like megaWatts per square mm2). The final temperature would then depend on the energy balance of that spot.  Equilibrium between energy input and energy losses (radiation, convection etc.) at given temperature.

Could any of you give an more detailed answer or just point out errors in my reasoning?

We are Dr. Mads Daugaard, Dr. Nader Al Nakouzi, Chris Wang, and Gunjan Kumar from the Vancouver Prostate Centre. We are part of the group that recently published a study detailing the use of a malaria protein, VAR2CSA, as a new and novel way of targeting cancers.


Cancer and the placenta show many similar characteristics. However, scientists have spent decades trying to find biochemical similarities between placenta tissue and cancer. Together with our colleagues from University of Copenhagen we discovered how malaria uses VAR2CSA to embed itself in the placenta and how the same target is present on cancer cells. Based on that discovery we immediately saw its potential to deliver cancer drugs in a precise, controlled way to tumors.


New and novel ways of targeting cancers are needed in order to combat the disease. With a recombinant version of VAR2CSA, we hope to develop a promising therapy for a broad spectrum of different cancers.

I led one of two research groups that independently found why elephants don’t get cancer as frequently as we thought they should (Spoiler: 20 copies of the p53 tumor suppressor gene). AMA!",Vinny_Lynch,"Hi, I’m [Vinny Lynch](http://lynchlab.uchicago.edu/index.html), assistant professor in the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago.

A while back, I got interested in Peto’s Paradox: the observation that big and long-lived organisms like elephants and whales don’t get cancer as often as we think they should. If all cells have a similar risk of developing cancer, then really large animals should be at really high risk.

But there’s absolutely no correlation between body size or lifespan and cancer rates.

So we studied elephant genomes, and now we think we’ve found the mechanism that explains the paradox. Elephants have 20 copies of the very well-known p53 tumor suppressor gene (to be precise: one p53 gene and 19 p53 retrogenes).

We looked in 60+ other animals, including whales, fish, birds, and humans, but found that only elephants (and maybe bats) have more than one p53 gene. We looked in woolly mammoth and mastodon genomes as well, and shed some light onto the evolutionary origins of p53 expansion (if you’re curious about mammoth genomes I did [another AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3csgs6/science_ama_series_im_vinny_lynch_geneticist_at/) a few months ago). Lastly, we transferred one of the extra p53 genes from elephants into mouse cells that we grew in the lab and made some pretty interesting observations.

We released our findings on the [open-access preprint server BioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/06/028522), and another group, which came to pretty much the same conclusion but focused mostly only on elephants and humans, independently released theirs in [JAMA](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2456041).

2015-10-10 14:56:30+00:00,3437,Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?,a_great_thinker,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

This group of scientists [published a study](http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09560) in the journal eLife last Thursday reporting their discovery of 1,500 fossilized bones deep in a South African cave 30 miles northwest of Johannesburg. These remains belong to a creature now known as Homo naledi, or “star” in the Sotho language. The finding could potentially rewrite Homo sapiens’ coming-of-age story and help fill in a crucial gap in the fossil record.

The site required a special team of experts slender enough to wriggle down a vertical, pitch-dark, seven-inch-wide passage. Morris and Peixotto fit that bill. They descended into the chamber through a narrow chute almost 100 yards from the cave entrance, and used toothpicks to dig out the ancient fossils without damaging them.

Hannah Morris: http://chenaconsultingservices.weebly.com/about-me.html

I grew up caving and climbing with my family in northwest Georgia, and got involved in archaeology in college. I traveled around as a “shovelbum” for a few years, hopping between Mexico and Alaska and the southeast U.S. I started working with the American Museum of Natural History on a barrier island, St. Catherine’s Island, off the coast of Georgia in 2008. I’ve excavated in some unusual and intense circumstances, keeping an eye out for moose and bear in Alaska and working in the marsh in a rising tide in Georgia. I was actually on a dig on the island when I came in from the field one day and saw the job posting on Facebook. I had a very interesting interview with Lee via Skype, and then within 2 weeks I was on a plane headed for Joburg. The project has been one of the most incredible experiences I’ve ever had, for so many reasons. Obviously, the science is amazing, and how we excavated the site and what we found is going to change paleoanthropology forever. In addition to the scientific impact, the Rising Star Expedition has had a huge personal impact on us all, I think. It’s very exciting to be involved with so many wonderful people, who are so dedicated to this common goal of advancing and promoting science, and it’s been really rewarding to see the public get involved and excited about this project.

Becca Peixotto: @beccapeixotto

I heard about the famous Facebook ad from a friend who forwarded it to me with a note “this sounds like you.” A small archaeologist with caving and climbing experience for a mysterious expedition in South Africa?  I sent my CV to Lee, talked with him over Skype and just a few weeks later I was arriving in Jo’burg. My previous career (with which I am still involved sometimes) was in outdoor and experiential education. I led wilderness expeditions including rock climbing and caving in mountain and desert environments for Outward Bound and other organizations (and I’ve done those activities on countless personal adventures too). Joining Rising Star was an exciting way to out my technical outdoor skills to use in my other passion of archaeology. I often find myself excavating in remote, inaccessible locations with challenging environments like the Rising Star cave or the remote interior of the Great Dismal Swamp (VA and NC- the location of my PhD research). It has been such a joy and privilege to be a part of Rising Star. The fossil discovery is mind-blowing in itself but Rising Star has also raised the bar for how paleoanthropology happens: where we look, the technology we use to record sites, who gets to excavate and analyze the fossils and how we communicate the process of doing this kind of science with the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3l5u68/askscience_ama_series_were_hannah_morris_and/,askscience,357,

We are joined by the Mission Team onboard the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer to answer your questions about our expedition to explore  the deep waters off Hawaii. 

We are on the second of four expedition legs and are exploring in Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. We will also later explore Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. These large marine protected areas are national symbols of ocean conservation; however, given their remote location, the vast majority of deeper waters in these areas remains unseen by human eyes. Learn more about the expedition here: http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1504/welcome.html

Throughout the expedition, we are using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to explore the seafloor, and our ROVs’ video streams are being transmitted via satellite from ship to shore. This means anyone with an Internet connection can tune in LIVE with scientists from around the world sharing an unprecedented glimpse of never-seen-before deep marine habitats. Access the live video here: http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/media/exstream/exstream.html.

We expect to encounter large, diverse coral and sponge communities; explore ancient seamounts; map the seafloor; and learn more about the geologic history of the area. Information collected during the expedition will support management decisions to protect what we know as well as what we have yet to discover.

We have all participated in numerous deep-ocean exploration missions. (joining us is /u/melanostomias ) We’re here from 2:00 pm ET to 4:00 pm ET to answer your questions about the Hawaiian expedition or ocean exploration in general...AUA!

AMA!",StephanLewandowsky,"Hi, I am Stephan Lewandowsky. I am a Professor of Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol. I am also affiliated with the Cabot Institute at the University of Bristol, which is an inter-disciplinary research center dedicated to exploring the challenges of living with environmental uncertainty. I received my undergraduate degree from Washington College (Chestertown, MD), and a Masters and PhD from the University of Toronto. I served on the Faculty at the University of Oklahoma from 1990 to 1995 before moving to Australia, where I was a Professor at the University of Western Australia until two years ago. I’ve published more than 150 peer-reviewed journal articles, chapters, and books.


I have been fascinated by several questions during my career, but most recently I have been working on issues arising out of the apparent conflict between two complex systems, namely the limitations of our human cognitive apparatus and the structure of the Earth’s climate system. I have been particularly interested in two aspects of this apparent conflict: One that arises from the opposition of some people to the findings of climate science, which has led to the dissemination of much disinformation, and one that arises from people’s inability to understand the consequences of scientific uncertainty surrounding climate change.


I have applied my research to both issues, which has resulted in various scholarly publications and two public “handbooks”. The first handbook summarized the literature on how to debunk misinformation and was written by John Cook and myself and can be found here: http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html. The second handbook on “communicating and dealing with uncertainty” was written by Adam Corner, with me and two other colleagues as co-authors, and it appeared earlier this month. It can be found here: 

http://www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org/cornerUHB.html.  


I have also recently published 4 papers that show that denial of climate science is often associated with an element of conspiratorial thinking or discourse (three of those were with Klaus Oberauer as co-author). U.S. Senator Inhofe has been seeking confirmation for my findings by writing a book entitled “The Greatest Hoax: How the global warming conspiracy threatens your future.”
 

I am Klaus Oberauer. I am Professor of Cognitive Psychology at University of Zurich. I am interested in how human intelligence works, and why it is limited: To what degree is our reasoning and behavior rational, and what are the limits to our rationality? I am also interested in the Philosophy of Mind (e.g., what is consciousness, what does it mean to have a mental representation?)


I studied psychology at the Free University Berlin and received my PhD from University of Heidelberg. I’ve worked at Universities of Mannheim, Potsdam, and Bristol before moving to Zurich in 2009.  With my team in Zurich I run experiments testing the limits of people’s cognitive abilities, and I run computer simulations trying to make the algorithms behave as smart, and as dumb, as real people.


We look forward to answering your question about psychology, cognition, uncertainty in climate science, and the politics surrounding all that. Ask us almost anything!

People (including me) have asked, if Kepler 452b had Earth-equivalent technology, and were transmitting television and radio and whatever else, would we be able to detect it. Most answers I've seen dodged the question by pointing out that Kepler 452b is 1600 light years away, so if they were equal to us now, then, we wouldn't get anything because their transmissions wouldn't arrive here until 1600 years from now.

Which is missing the point. The real question is, if they had *at least* our technology from roughly 1600 years ago, and we pointed out absolute best receivers at it, could we *then* ""hear"" anything?

Someone seemed to have answered this in a roundabout way by saying that the New Horizons is barely out of our solar system and we can hardly hear it, and it's designed to transmit to us, so, no, we probably couldn't receive any incidental transmissions from somewhere 1600 light years away.

So, if that's true, then what is the deal with SETI? Does it assume there are civilizations out there doing stuff on a huge scale, way, way bigger than us that we could recieve it from thousands of light years away? Is it assuming that they are transmitting something directly at us?

What is SETI doing if it's near impossible for us to overhear anything from planets like ours that we know about?


**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for the thought provoking responses. I'm sorry it's a little hard to respond to all of them.

Where I am now after considering all the replies, is that /u/rwired (currently most upvoted response) pointed out that SETI can detect signals from transmission-capable planets up to 1000ly away. This means that it's not the case that SETI can't confirm life on planets that Kepler finds, it's just that Kepler has a bigger range.

I also understand, as another poster mentioned, that Kepler wasn't necessarily meant to find life supporting planets, just to find planets, and finding life supporting planets is just a bonus.

Still... it seems to me that, unless there's a technical limitation I don't yet get, that it would have been the best of all possible results for Kepler to first look for planets within SETI range before moving beyond. That way, we could have SETI perform a much more targeted search.

Is there no way SETI and Kepler can join forces, in a sense?

**ANOTHER EDIT:** It seems this post made top page? And yet my karma doesn't change at all. I don't understand Reddit karma. **AND YET MORE EDITING:** Thanks to all who explained the karma issue. I was vaguely aware that ""self posts"" don't get karma, but did not understand why. Now it has been explained to me that self posts don't earn karma so as to prevent ""circle jerking"".

Sharks are absolutely vital to the health of the ecosystems they inhabit. Additionally, some shark species represent an important resource for the commercial and recreational fishing communities.  

As a shark biologist with NOAA Fisheries, my job is to monitor trends in abundance of coastal sharks in U.S. waters off the East Coast and throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico. To do this, my colleagues and I spend a couple of months each year collecting important information about various shark species from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Brownsville, Texas. The resulting data are used by stock assessment analysts to determine if population levels are increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant. Other areas of my research include examining the behavior, distribution, growth, habitat use, and reproduction of sharks. 


I’ll be here from 11:00am ET through 1:00pm ET today answering your questions about sharks as well as what it’s like to study these amazing fish… AMA!

**EDIT: Please check to see that your question hasn't already been answered. There's not many of us able to answer all these questions, so we're removing repeat top level questions. Feel free to ask follow-ons on existing threads**

A second large ([magnitude 7.3 ish](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002ejl#scientific_tensor) - this is likely to be revised in the coming hours as more data is collated) earthquake has occurred in Nepal this morning. This is related to the [M7.8 which occurred last month](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002926#scientific_tensor) also in Nepal.

These earthquakes are occurring on fauilts related to the ongoing collision of the Indian subcontinent into Asia, which in turn s building the HImalayan plateau through a complex structure of fault and folding activity.

[Thrust faults are generally low angle (&lt;30 degree) faults, in which the upper surface moves over the lower surface to shorten  the total crustal length, and increase crustal thickness around the fault](http://facweb.bhc.edu/academics/science/harwoodr/Geol101/study/Images/Thrust.gif).  Because of the large weight of overlying rock, and the upward movement required by the [headwall (or hanging wall)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cKknu9lsZbQ/T207I50MoNI/AAAAAAAAGr4/JbZSApxFK5M/s1600/Headwall+and+footwall.jpg) of the fault, these types of fault are able to accumulate enormous stresses before failure, which in turn leads to these very large magnitude events.

The earthquake in April has had a number of aftershocks related to it, as when an earthquake occurs the stress field around a fault system changes, and new peak-stress locations form elsewhere. This can cause further movement on the same or adjacent faults nearby.

2015-03-14 11:52:55+00:00,3490,Happy Pi Day! Come celebrate with us,AskScienceModerator,"
It's 3/14/15, the Pi Day of the century! Grab a slice of your favorite Pi Day dessert and celebrate with us. 

**Our experts are here to answer your questions, and this year we have a treat that's *almost* sweeter than pi: we've teamed up with some experts from /r/AskHistorians to bring you the history of pi.** We'd like to extend a special thank you to these users for their contributions here today!

Here's some reading from /u/Jooseman to get us started:

&gt; The symbol π was not known to have been introduced to represent the number until 1706, when Welsh Mathematician William Jones (a man who was also close friends with Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Edmund Halley) used it in his work *Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos* (or a *New Introduction to the Mathematics*.) There are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. The favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient Greek word for periphery (the circumference).

&gt; Before this time the symbol π has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in Geometry, where William Oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (Oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). In Ancient Greece it represented the number 80.

&gt; The story of its introduction does not end there though. It did not start to see widespread usage until Leonhard Euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other European Mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. Euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work *Mechanica* and finally it was his use of it in the widely read *Introductio* in 1748 that really helped it spread.

Will the heavier rider have done exactly twice the work add the lighter rider? Logic tells me that the potential energy of the heavier rider should be double that of the lighter rider, but I didn't do physics at school, so I could well be wrong.
If both riders were running a power meter (powertap, quarq etc) well that show double the work having been done?

And what is the appropriate measurement for that? Watt hours?

Thanks for the great answers everyone. I didn't expect this to hit the front page - this is my first ever post to Ask Science.

Edit: To stop any arguments about the densities of Aluminium and Sulfur Hexafluoride, Al=2700kg/(m^3), and SF6=6.17kg/(m^3), so floating aluminium is due to buoyancy, not directly by difference in density. But it's still pretty cool :)

Edit 2: I should probably clarify further. When I talk about a floating solid, I mean either a solid element, or compound, as opposed to an object with a non-uniform density, made up of more than one material (ie. balloon), so we're talking about direct pressure difference, as opposed to buoyancy.

Edit 3: Right, I now understand how I wasn't making any sense with my 'uniform density/buoyancy' thing. I do now understand buoyancy, sorry about any confusion. Basically, what I wanted to know is whether a solid of uniform density would float in a gas of uniform density, if the solid was less dense than the gas.

If *c* is steadily increasing then photon's of constant frequency would have that get longer over time. Moreover the amount of shift to longer wavelength would be proportional to the time since the photon was emitted, which is proportional to our distance from its origin.

2015-02-15 16:36:18+00:00,2920,"If we were to discover life on other planets, wouldn't time be moving at a completely different pace for them due to relativity?",elspacebandito,"I've thought about this a bit since my undergrad days; I have an advanced degree in math but never went beyond basic physics.

My thinking is this: The relative passage of time for an individual is dependent on its velocity, correct? So the relative speed of the passage of time here on earth is dependent on the planet's velocity around the sun, the solar system's velocity through the galaxy, the movement of the galaxy through the universe, and probably other stuff. All of these factor into the velocity at which we, as individuals, are moving through the universe and hence the speed at which we experience the passage of time.

So it seems to me that all of those factors (the planet's velocity around its star, the system's movement through the galaxy, etc.) would vary widely across the universe. And, since that is the case, an individual standing on the surface of a planet somewhere else in the galaxy would, relative to an observer on Earth at least, experience  time passing at a much different rate than we do here on Earth.

How different would it be, though? How much different would the factors I listed (motion of the galaxy, velocity of the planet's orbit, etc.) have to be in order for the relative time difference to be significant? Celestial velocities seem huge and I figure that even small variations could have significant effects, especially when compounded over millions of years.

So I guess that's it! Just something I've been thinking about off and on for several years, and I'm curious how accurate my thoughts on this topic are.

**Edit**: More precise language. And here is an example to (I hope) illustrate what I'm trying to describe.

Say we had two identical stopwatches. At the same moment, we place one stopwatch on Earth and the other on a distant planet. Then we wait. We millions or billions years. If, after that time, someone standing next to the Earth stopwatch were able to see the stopwatch that had been placed on another planet, how much of a difference could there potentially be between the two?",http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vzbwj/if_we_were_to_discover_life_on_other_planets/,askscience,446,

What I saw was that there were cases where the ~~planet~~ body moved in a shape of 8 around them both. 

Moreover, any disturbances created in the 'perfectness' of the 8 shape by my initial trajectory, oscillated around the hypothetically mean 8 orbit as if it was trying to correct itself. Lets assume that my pair of stars is aligned vertically for now. I began a 8 shape orbit with the stars as the 'focii' of the lobes. If the top lobe is slightly tilted towards left and bottom lobe tilted towards right, the orbit slowly changed such that the top lobe now tilted towards right and the bottom one towards left, and the orbit oscillated between these two states, becoming nearly symmetric in between these oscillations.

I found that really interesting, and wondered whether such orbits can happen in real and have been observed in the universe.

....Or is it just because of inaccuracies in the simulator app!

He claimed to have seen the same surface pattern for a long time. I looked it up, and according to space.com (http://www.space.com/24871-does-the-moon-rotate.html), the moon does always have the same side facing earth, with only a few degrees of variation. I also read in the same article that in the same way the moon affects the earth's sea with its gravitational force, it also slightly affects the rest of the mass on earth, and with that increases the rotation time of the earth, if even so slightly. I got curious and looked around for more detailed articles about this, and wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation) said that atomic clocks have found that a full rotation increase by approximately 1.7 milliseconds every century. This got me thinking, how long was a day on earth around the time the moon was born? The Guardian (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-old-is-the-moon-true-age-is-finally-revealed-9236150.html) wrote that scientists, with a 99.9 % certainty, have found that the moon is 4.47 billion years old. I whipped out my calculator and the result was that the day has increased with ~21 hours since then. (I assume the number isn't perfect because of how the gravitational powers of the moon and earth have changed, especially around the time after the impact that gave birth to the moon, but still, the numbers can't be that far off) I thought this was really cool, but also really absurd at the same time! So now I ask reddit. Can you confirm that this is correct? Have I misinterpreted some of these articles, or was I simply too hasty with my mathematics?

edit: Thanks for all the comments guys! Didn't expect to have this big of a discussion come out from my question.

How many times can a bar magnet be broken in half until the poles of the new parts are no longer discernible?,Bausse,"*Well this has been blown up quite a bit so I'll leave it at that.*
____

Pretty much as the question states.  

Basically, how many times can [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/CuttingABarMagnet.svg/540px-CuttingABarMagnet.svg.png) be done until the poles of the new pieces are no longer discernible, or will they always be there?

~~edit: I'm studying for my physics midterm tomorrow - which actually prompted this question - so I'll get back to replying soon.  It's all making much more sense though, thank you!~~

The answer seems to be: ~~... **until you are left with an atom**~~.   Well, the question still stands.  Discussion of [magnetic domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_domain) has been brought up as a possible conclusion.

A follow-up question involving magnetic domains: [this gif](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Moving_magnetic_domains_by_Zureks.gif/220px-Moving_magnetic_domains_by_Zureks.gif) shows many magnetic domains become one big magnetic domain, or a magnetic crystal.  What properties does a magnetic crystal have since it's only in one alignment? What else is happening here?  

...

An easy answer to the main question would be a singular atom, due to a single atom's own magnetic field.  However, for purposes of practicality, magnetic domains are the components of a magnet and are what we would be splitting.  Indeed, an atom can kind of pose as its own magnetic domain but that's reaching.

&gt;But it's difficult to contract. The only way to catch Ebola is to have direct contact with the bodily fluids — vomit, sweat, blood, feces, urine or saliva — of someone who has Ebola and has begun showing symptoms.

Direct contact with ***Sweat***? That sounds trivially easy to me. HIV is spread through blood-blood contact and that's had a fine time spreading in the US. 

So why is Ebola so ""hard to catch""? Is it that it's only infectious after symptoms show, so we figure we won't have infectious people on the street? That's delusional, considering US healthcare costs. 

Or is it (as I'm assuming) that it's more complex than simply ""contact with sweat""?

What happened? has being that big just become useless from a survival aspect? has the density of air changed to make flying not need such big wings? something to do with wind speeds?

We are Denis Malyshev (/u/danmalysh), Kiran Dhami (/u/kdhami), Thomas Lavergne (/u/ThomasLav), Yorke Zhang (/u/yorkezhang), Elie Diner (/u/ediner), Aaron Feldman (/u/AaronFeldman), Brian Lamb (/u/technikat), and Floyd Romesberg (/u/fromesberg), past and present members of the Romesberg Lab that recently published the paper [A semi-synthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7500/full/nature13314.html)  
 
The Romesberg lab at The Scripps Research Institute has had a long standing interest in expanding the alphabet of life.  All natural biological information is encoded within DNA as sequences of the natural letters, G, C, A, and T (also known as nucleotides). These four letters form two “base pairs:” every time there is a G in one strand, it pairs with a C in the other, and every time there is an A in one strand it pairs with a T in the other, and thus two complementary strands of DNA form the famous double stranded helix.  The information encoded in the sequences of the DNA strands is ultimately retrieved as the sequences of amino acids in proteins, which directly or indirectly perform all of a cell’s functions.  This way of storing information is the same in all organisms, in fact, as best we can tell, it has always been this way, all the way back to the last common ancestor of all life on earth.
 
Adding new letters to DNA has proven to be a challenging task: the machinery that replicates DNA, so that it may be passed on to future generations, evolved over billions of years to only recognize the four natural letters.  However, over the past decade or so, we have worked to create a new pair of letters (we can call them X and Y for simplicity) that are well recognized by the replication machinery, but only in a test tube.  In our recent paper, we figured out how to get X and Y into a bacterial cell, and that once they were in, the cells’ replication machinery recognized them, resulting in the first organism that stably stores increased information in its DNA.
 
Now that we have cells that store increased information, we are working on getting them to retrieve it in the form of proteins containing unnatural amino acids.  Based on the chemical nature of the unnatural amino acids, these proteins could be tailored to have properties that are far outside the scope of natural proteins, and we hope that they might eventually find uses for society, such as new drugs for different diseases.

An OS switches context between processes several times a second, and this makes it seem as though all your processes are running simultaneously (and on multicore systems many of them actually are running simultaneously). Sometimes processes get put into a waiting state when they are trying to access slower resources like I/O or a hard drive. Is this what causes an OS to mark a process as ""not responding""? When a process is waiting too long? When I'm writing a program I don't write messages to the OS to let it know that I'm running fine, so I'm assuming it has to have something to do with waiting. 

Also, are there ways to handle your code so that this non-responsiveness doesn't happen as often for your process?

Here's how it works: You come up with scientific questions that pique your interest, and get answers based on solid science from experts and knowledgeable members of the AskScience community. To keep our content high quality, we encourage you to post comments that...

* ...are on topic, factual, and scientific

* ...clarify questions and answers

* ...link to peer reviewed literature

* ...are free of idle guesses, speculation, and anecdotes.

More extensive posting and upvoting guidelines can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/guidelines). This community promotes high quality posts by upvoting science that's worth reading. Jokes, memes, [medical advice](http://www.reddit.com/s4chc), and off-topic banter are downvoted and reported. We remove these items to keep the discussion focused on science. Sometimes it is very convenient to phrase a follow-up post as a question to continue the discussion.

Keep an eye out for AskScience panelists. They are experts with at minimum, postgraduate experience in their field. They are are highly knowledgable contributors who are responsible for some of the best content that is posted to AskScience. If you qualify, we highly encourage you to make some posts to AskScience so you can [apply for flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1axwqz/askscience_panel_of_scientists_viii/).

You don't have to be a panelist to answer questions in AskScience, but we do ask that you be educated in the field of the question you are answering. You should be prepared to substantiate your answers. Try to give answers that are scientific, but are at a level where someone without a background in the field can understand them.

Many questions submitted to AskScience undergo an editorial process before they appear. Not all questions make it to the front page. Please [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if something is amiss -- we're here to help.

We'd now like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's helped bring us here today.

First, we'd like to give a big thank you to the [reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/about/team/) and /u/hueypriest in particular for making this happen. We're very grateful for their enthusiasm and support for science content on reddit. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to do on a larger scale what AskScience does best.

Next, we want to thank all of our panelists for continuing to share with us your insights and fascinating ideas about science. Your expertise and patience in answering questions is what has made our subreddit stand out as a source for enlightening scientific discourse.

Finally, to our nearly 800,000 AskScience subscribers -- thank you for your continued support. Your enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge is truly inspirational. It is a major reason why we volunteer everyday to keep this place running. We realize that we couldn't have come this far without you, and it was a major consideration in our decision to return this subreddit back to default. Many of you are visible ambassadors of AskScience and play a critical role in our success. 

Please continue to welcome new redditors to this community and share the [best of reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) that AskScience has to offer.

It's been a fantastic journey growing this subreddit from a handful of subscribers to the very popular forum that it is today. That said, we understand that many of you might have concerns about how being a default subreddit might change things here. Rest assured, the mods are keeping a close eye on things, and we will chart AskScience's future based on what we see from this new traffic.

This is a great moment to reflect and look forward to the future. To celebrate, please share your thoughts about AskScience below!

The most destructive wind will generally start to wane within about 100 miles of the storm coming ashore, especially with a weaker storm like Sandy.
&gt;
&gt;...it boils down to this. This is not going to be a Katrina caliber storm. There's a hell of a lot of infrastructure in the region that is going to ensure a rapid response from emergency workers and the government. They've got a lot of warning. Katrina intensified rapidly right before landfall, Sandy isn't likely to. Also, the area isn't apt to flood and then stay flooded like New Orleans did.

&gt;You're going to see a huge chunk of real estate without power, probably in to the weekend, but it should rapidly recover after that. You're going to see a huge chunk of real estate under water, but it should subside by Thursday

This is an exciting moment for all of us and I'm sure many of you are burning with questions. Here is a place for you to submit all your questions regarding the mission, the rover, and Mars!

Update:

----------

FAQs (summarized from [the official press release](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/MSLLanding.pdf)):

**What is the purpose of the mission?**

The four stated objectives are:

1. Assessing the biological potential by examining organic compounds - the ""building blocks of life"" - and searching for evidence of biologically relevant processes.

2. Uncovering the geological processes that formed the rocks and soil found on Mars, by studying the isotopical and mineralogical content of surface materials.

3. Investigate past and present habitability of Mars and the distribution and cycling of water and carbon dioxide.

4. Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation.

**How was the mission site chosen?**

In line with the mission objectives, Gale Crater is located at a low elevation, so past water would likely have pooled inside the crater, leaving behind evidence such as clay and sulfate minerals. The impact that created the crater also revealed many different layers, each of which will give clues on the planetary conditions at the time the material was deposited.

While previous landing sites must be chosen to safeguard the landing of the spacecraft, the new ""sky crane"" landing system allows for a much more accurate landing, which, combined with the mobility of the rover, meant that the mission site can be some distance from the landing site. The primary mission will focus on the lower elevations of the Gale Crater, with possible exploration in the higher slopes in future extended missions.

For a more detailed explanation see [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/wvqwt/why_was_the_curiosity_rover_not_landed_at_the/c5h97sr).

**Why is the ""sky crane maneuver"" to land the rover?**

The Curiosity rover is the biggest - and more importantly, the heaviest - rover landed on Mars. It has a mass of 899 kg, compared to Spirit and Opportunity rovers, coming at 170 kg each. Prior strategies include landing the rover on legs, as the [Viking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_lander) and [Phoenix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_lander) landers did, and using airbags, as [Spirit and Opportunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_and_Opportunity) did, but the sheer size and weight of Curiosity means those two methods are not practical.

**What happens to the descent stage after it lowers the rover?**

The descent stage of the spacecraft, after releasing the rover, is programmed to crash at least 150 metres (likely twice that distance) away from the lander, towards the North pole of Mars, to avoid contamination of the mission site. Currently there is no telemetry data on it yet.

**How long does it take for data to transmit one way between Earth and Mars?**

On the day of landing, it takes approximately 13.8 minutes for data to be transmitted one way directly from Curiosity to Earth via the Deep Space Network, at a data rate of 160 - 800 bits per second. Much of the data can also be relayed via the Mars orbiters ([Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter) and [Mars Odessy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Odyssey)) at 2 megabits per second.

See [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xo5vm/how_does_the_mars_rover_curiosity_send_radio/) for more detail.

**What are the differences between this rover and the previous ones landed on Mars?**

For an overview of the scientific payload, see the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27%27Curiosity%27%27_rover#Payload). This includes such valuable scientific instruments such as a [laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser-induced_breakdown_spectroscopy), not found in the previous rovers. The [gas chromatography system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_Chromatograph), [quadrupole mass spectrometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_Mass_Spectrometer) and tuneable laser spectrometer are also part of the payload, not included in the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.

Discussion in comments [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xr3s0/the_official_mars_science_laboratory_and/c5ouzu6), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xr3s0/the_official_mars_science_laboratory_and/c5oup1e).

**Why were the [first images](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/images/first_images_mars.html) of such low resolution?**

The purpose for the first thumbnail images are to confirm that the Rover has landed and has operational capabilities. These images were taken from the Hazard Avoidance cameras (HazCams), rather than the main cameras. More images will be sent in the next window 15 hours after landing in order to pinpoint the landing site.

The Rover has a Mars Descent Imager capable of 1600 x 1200 video at 4 frames per second. The MastCam (with Bayer filter) is capable of 1600 x 1200 photographs, along with 720p video at 4 - 7 fps. The Hands Lens Imager is capable of the same image resolution for magnified or close-up images. The ChemCam can take 1024 x 1024 monochromatic images with telescopic capabilities. These cameras will be activated as part of the commissioning process with the rest of the scientific payload in the upcoming days/weeks.

**How is Curiosity powered?**

The Rover contains a [radioisotope thermoelectric power generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator), powered by 4.8 kg of plutonium dioxide. It is designed to provide power for at least 14 years.

[Discussion in comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xr3s0/the_official_mars_science_laboratory_and/c5ouuh8).

**When will Curiosity take its first drive? When will experimentation begin?**

The first drive will take place more than one week after landing. It will take several weeks to a month to ensure that all systems are ready for science operations.

2012-07-04 06:08:11+00:00,2410,The official Higgs announcement thread.,Ruiner,"In a few hours, we will have an official announcement from the CERN teams about the searches for the Higgs boson. I'll update this afterwards.

(You should also check [the previous Higgs thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/naxmk/the_everything_you_need_to_know_about_the_higgs/) where many of the common questions were answered)

For many reasons, this is a very exciting moment for everyone in the community. Many of the older folks spent their life constructing all the building blocks of what we now know as the ""standard model of particle physics"", and the discovery of the Higgs ends this big chapter in our understanding of nature. For us younger physicists, this might be the first and only occasion in our lifetimes in which we get to witness a major experimental discovery in particle physics. 


The LHC was built because we were **sure** that something would be found, since the theory for electro-weak interactions without the Higgs becomes completely unpredictive once we cross this energy range. Since [W bosons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) are massive, they carry an extra degree of freedom - while light has 2 polarizations, both transverse to the direction of propagation of the light beam, W are also polarized in the direction parallel to their propagation. This longitudinal degree of freedom is troublesome, since it makes the probability of collision of W bosons collide grow very fast with the energy, so fast that it crosses the ""unitarity scale"", meaning that the sum of all the probabilities of different ways in which W bosons interact no longer add to 1.


When this happens, we need to ""resolve"" the interactions. This means that, while at large distances what we see is two W colliding, at short distances the Ws can also produces a particle and this particle again decays into Ws. Summing up all these contributions, we have again something finite. (Check the last 3 of these [diagrams](http://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img191.gif))


The Higgs - or whatever particle is in there at 126GeV - is very heavy and decays almost immediately into some lighter particles, so we cannot really produce it as a final state, thus we need indirect ways of detecting it. Check the above diagrams again: you see that the presence of the Higgs changes the ways in which the W bosons can scatter, so we can look for these signals. W bosons are also too heavy to be produced as a final state, so we need something else. We start by shooting protons against each other, and these protons contain 3 quarks each. The quarks can emit W bosons, and the W can also collide and produce a Higgs, as can be seen in this [diagram](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HGd0kIqlg9c/TzHA08T1kSI/AAAAAAAAAk4/oCfwX1eseKQ/s1600/vbf.png). Once the Higgs is produced, it will immediately decay into some light final state such as photons or quarks. What we really observe is an excess in the production of any of these final states when compared to the predictions of the same scattering without the Higgs. And in order to determine if the Higgs is really the Higgs, we compare the ""branching ratios"" of the theory with the experiment, which means that it has to produce just the ""right ammount"" of each final state.  


So is this guy also responsible for giving a mass to all the particles? Yes and no. In the real construction, the Higgs particle is part of something called the Higgs mechanism. In this mechanism, the energy is minimized once the Higgs field fills the whole space with a Higgs condensate: the field has a ""vacuum expectation value"", and the actual Higgs boson are just the excitations of this field, like ripples on the water. Almost every particle interacts with this field, and by this interaction they become massive.



* What changed since the last announcement?

Now they have more data and it's possible to say with a lot more certainty that there is in fact some particle with a mass of around 126 GeV. We'll have to wait until the announcement to know exactly how certain it is, but it's likely to be already above 5 sigma, so we can celebrate.

edit: 
now we have

from CMS: 125.3 +/- 0.6 GeV @ 4.9 sigma

from Atlas: 126.5 Gev @ 5.0 sigma



* Is it the Higgs?

It's needed more data. But their result seems to be compatible with the standard model Higgs.


* What now?

If it's really a Higgs, then we need to solve the Hierarchy problem or abandon the idea of naturalness. The problem is that the Higgs is ""unaturally light"", since quantum corrections would ""naturally"" make the Higgs mass as big as the Planck scale (10^19 GeV compared to the 126) and to make it light we need a an arbitrary cancellation that is heavily fine-tuned. The best candidates were supersymmetry and large extra dimensions, but it seems that both are very unlikely now.

If it's not a Higgs, then we probably will see more signals in the future, and the greatest theoretical challenge will be to figure out what exactly it is!",http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/w0qgf/the_official_higgs_announcement_thread/,askscience,770,
