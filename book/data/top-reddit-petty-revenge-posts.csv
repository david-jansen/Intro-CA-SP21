This happened earlier last year but I was really inspired to share it after hearing all of your petty ass responses

So last year after a really horrible break up, I had to move with a friend who was moving into a 5 bedroom house with some of her “friends” from the university. I saw this opportunity as the literal light at the end of a tunnel for me, and even tho I was aware that challenges would arise along the way,  I didn’t expect it to turn into an absolute nightmare. 

This was a 2 leveled house and I (F27) was living on the first floor with another girl that was about my age. Upstairs lived the 3 boys (22,25,28). I essentially stopped using the kitchen, or going upstairs at all because I couldn’t stand the conditions of the place. There were always people over trashing the place and no one would do anything to clean up. Saying it was messy is an understatement, There was a terrible cockroach infestation because of trash and because the sink was always full with their dishes and leftover food. I made an effort to organize the house many times and eventually the just hated me for asking them to do their dishes, or move their laundry after months of it being piled up over the drier. So after a few months I gave up and the household was just totally divided. Upstairs was enemy territory and viceversa. I always kept to myself and stayed in my room minding my business, never invited anyone over because the situation was pitiful and embarrassing. It was such a nice house and it straight up looked like a crackhouse. 

ANYWAYS. I hate them lol, one night (like most other nights), they were upstairs playing videos games and listening to music, BLASTING music and stomping around and throwing shit past 10pm on a Monday . Now as if this wasn’t annoying, my room was directly under the living room and balcony where I could hear every sentence even if they were speaking at a normal level. But considering I could hear them doing lines upstairs, yelling was the normal volume. However this night , this fucking night , they did that until 6am!!!! I asked them to turn the music volume down and they blew me off. I had school and then work the next day so I was beyond livid. So having no sleep and finally assuming they were sleeping since the house was dead quiet. At this point I quietly went upstairs. They were past out on the couch and the kitchen is right next to it. I almost simultaneously started blasting music from my speaker while aggressively throwing the dishes around. And I’m Saying aggressively because I was Literally throwing pots and stuff around  being as loud as humanly possible. I was so happy  disrupting their sleep I still smile when I think about them having to endure that. I kept at it for about an hour and headed downstairs with my breakfast having left a clean kitchen (I had heard some of their friends teasing them about being dirty) . It was one of the most passive aggressive and petty as things I’ve ever done in my life. And probably better than going to jail for murder lmfao, but if for some reason I end up as a ghost on earth, I’m going haunt them as if I was doing the dishes aggressively every night &amp;lt;3

Edit : thank you all for taking the time to read and comment on the post !! I wanted to clarify a few things I left out in the original post. 

1 yes they were definitely awake and not able to sleep through the noise (I would see them on the couch everytime I turned around and they were on their phone looking miserable. 


2. Some people are commenting that cleaning the kitchen was a waste of my time. While to some degree I may agree, my roommates friends had been teasing and calling out my roommates for living in a pig den (remember I can hear all their conversations from my room).  So I figured by cleaning it’d be a statement that reinforced that they were in fact pigs living in a pig den. 

3. Last thing, some people simply weren’t satisfied with the fact that I didn’t actually go apeshit on them or called the cops. We went to the same school and had common friends. I simply didn’t feel comfortable escalating the situation having to live with them + seeing them at school.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/ls1d9y/rude_roommates_get_rude_awakening/,pettyrevenge,192,0.0

Several years ago my mom had to have knee surgery leading her to be in crutches with limited mobility for several months she was granted an accessible parking permit. 

My mom went to the market to do her shopping and used the spot she wouldn't normally even use it but it was the dead of winter and super icy out.

When she was coming out there's a car with no sticker on it and this young kid getting out of his car parked right close to her car making it impossible to get in to unless she climbed over the passenger side. 

She was polite to the kid who had just left his car she said it was an older Toyota. She said can you love your car so I can get it the kid flat out said no I am just going in shopping I don't have the time and started to go in and she said I can't get in my car to witch she was let with a to bad and the fucker took off.
(I didint mention but it was like -40 out at the time)

Well this really pissed my mom off she grabbed the bottle of water in her basket and took her key to push open the lock hatch on each door and poored a healthy ammount of water in each lock got her self in to her passengers side door forced her way I. To her driver's seat and left parked on a different spot and waited.

The guy tried from open his car but you guessed it each lock was frozen she watched him struggle for 10min and left with a smile on her face.

...my mom is kinda evil..

2021-02-02 06:59:24+00:00,6842,Do Not Hurt the Tomatoes,KatiaV,"Once, many years ago, we innocently bought a house next door to a retired marine couple. She was about 6'2"" and strongly resembled Ahnold It's Not a Tumor in his current state, and he was about 5'7"" and probably weighed 130#. They were very house/yard proud and and thoroughly obnoxious about it. 

After living next to them for a short time, for some unknown reason (no, really!)  they decided to mount a campaign of general obnoxiousness against us. It started small, a note on a friend's car that he was three inches over on their side when parked on the street in front of our house. Then it escalated. Rapidly. They reported us to animal control for farm animals inside the city limit (We had two shih tzu. They were not used to pull a plow.) They reported us to the health dept. for leaving our pool with a small amount of water in it and breeding mosquitoes (it was hydrochloric acid being used to wash the pool and prep it for repair as it was derelict when we moved in). They reported us for repairing our fence without a permit. Not moving it, not tearing it down or replacing it, we merely nailed some boards back up. They reported us for loud parties, and quiet parties and no parties...they called city hall on us so often it became a joke amongst those hallowed halls. All the while they continued with the small harassments as well.

We ignored all of this, just making sure we had an extra plate for whatever official they called out that day.  But then, *then,* *they committed the ultimate crime*. 

We were breakfasting on the patio one lovely morning when I happened to look over and see a sprayer nozzle come through the fence slats. And they sprayed poison on my tomato and jalapeno plants. Now we love our salsa and I make an absolutely exquisite fresh salsa. And they dared spray poison on my tomato and jalapeno plants. 

Poison my tomatoes and peppers, will you? In Texas that's a killin' offense. Sadly, we did not live in Texas so I was forced to devise my own punishment. 

One thing about their house is that it must have been built on an ant hill. They constantly fought ants. We regularly heard them complaining about ants as they tried to rid them from their backyard. 

Our homes were built on a golf course and being considered patio homes all had lovely large patios with huge kitchen windows with sliding glass opening onto a pass through/serving counter.

So I made a very, very large batch of simple syrup and froze it in ice cube trays.  Friends and I would sit on our patio and toss ice cubes. We had a points system that ranged from getting the cubes on the patio, to getting them up against the base of the sliding door, to getting them onto the counter and up against the opening of the window. We gave them ants. Lots of ants. 

Not being particularly close neighbors, the Marines gave us no warning when they went on vacation. We did notice it got quieter and I didn't overhear any further discussion between them about the sticky mess that regularly showed up on their patio, but I didn't really think about it. Besides, I was behind on points. So the bombardment continued. 

The ants celebrated. They sent out telegrams worldwide inviting all of their relatives to move. They had found paradise. The grass was green and there were regular supply drops.

They invaded. There were tiny black ants, larger brown ants and big red ants. Hosannas were sung. They built neighborhoods of McAntsions. Ant Rockettes did the can-can across the counter. They held parades. There were Friday night fiestas with live ant mariachi bands. It was beautemous.  

I went through three 5lb bags of sugar.  

We knew exactly when the Marines got home from their six week cruise. We could tell by the screeches of anguish. Apparently the ants had made their way inside. There were screams from the kitchen, and the pantry, and the laundry room, and the bathroom. It was ear shattering. (Who knew a 5'7"" male could even make those sounds?)

Battle was enjoined. The Army Ants dug foxholes and built redoubts. The Fire Ants formed Special Forces teams and close protection units. 

The war raged for months.

Despite regular resupply, the ants were decimated. The Marines were seen collapsed in patio chairs, hollow eyed with exhaustion, their once pristine backyard closely resembling the aftermath of the battle of Ypres. 

Peace Talks were held. Detente was achieved. Calm reigned on Avenida Pancho Villa.

Until The Marines got their second breath and reinforcements in the form of their son, The Marine Jr.  Further shenanigans ensued. And yours truly discovered that raccoons are not only exceedingly dextrous, they are inordinately fond of overripe figs.

2021-01-31 15:18:39+00:00,9372,"Give me a huge task to do on my last day at work? Okay, I’ll leave it unfinished.",a_lemur_named_simon,"My last day at work was last week. I had been with this organisation for 2.5 years. I loved working here and always gave my absolute best, but unfortunately I had a supervisor who was absolutely biased and favoured incompetent employees over me. 

The problem is that, before her, I worked under another supervisor and he trained me in all sorts of tasks before he left. When my current supervisor took his role, she didn’t train each team member evenly and instead made each worker specialise in certain tasks. This would then lead to me receiving more work than others because I know how to get everything done, whereas my team members didn’t. I realised that I had enough and that I should move onto another role. 

Because this was a federal government job, I had to fill out so many forms and get many things done on my last day. On my last day, my supervisor was working from home and on top of the stuff I had to complete before I leave, she decided to give me two big tasks (booking travel and accommodation for two trips and this requires a massive formal process and so many forms to sign). No one else in my team does the travel tasks because they were always assigned to me. After being annoyed for a couple minutes, I decided to leave it and not start on the task, otherwise I would’ve left work 2 hours after my normal finishing time. 

That same evening while I was having farewell drinks with my colleagues (I live in a country where covid is under great control) I told them how I had 2 outstanding travel tasks that I couldn’t attend to because I was already busy finalising everything. One of my team members said “why didn’t *supervisor* give that task to me? I literally had nothing to do today!”. As if that didn’t annoy me already, I also remembered that my supervisor did not even send me a thank you/good luck/farewell email before she logged off. 

Oh well. Doesn’t matter. The next morning my supervisor would have clocked in to an unfinished task with no one to assign it to because they weren’t fully trained on it. A good start to a Monday!

Edit: A lot of you wanted an update but unfortunately I don’t have much. I messaged a close colleague asking how everything went. She told me that she was unsure who received the two travel tasks because the team received a massive and urgent print job that was due the next day so they were all focused on that for the whole day (since they were understaffed today). I also wasn’t contacted by my supervisor, but I ain’t picking up the phone if she contacts me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/l9e9ab/give_me_a_huge_task_to_do_on_my_last_day_at_work/,pettyrevenge,432,0.0
2020-11-16 19:07:14+00:00,2767,Sent my primary school teacher a copy of my university diploma,Amebl,"As the Austrian school system may be unfamiliar to most a short explanation.

After primary school children (age 10) will enter either Hauptschule or Gymnasium ( a school not for performing sports) depending among other things on grades earned during the last year of primary school. This system is sometimes compared with the schools in Great Britain of the 1940-1960 with the Gymnasium taking the place of the grammar school.

 The separation of the paths is not complete but attendance at a Gymnasium or equivalent is the standard needed for going to university. 

I have a slight hearing impairment and therefore had some troubles in school ( mind this was in the 80ies, so there were no concessions made).
I was a good student having above average grades.


Ms Baker ( not her name) my teacher I  this last year of primary school hated to have me in her class, first I could not sing (she lead the school choir) and second I was a handicapped kid that they had failed to get rid off to special education school.
The first thing she did was assigning me seating at the back of the room, all other kids were rotated regularly in seating, I stayed there.
This lead to some problems due to misheard instructions or words during dictation. 
At the end of the year in German my grades were between ""Good=2"" and ""Middling=3"", normally In this situation the student will be administered a short examination to decide the grade. Ms Baker decided that I had not earned that chance to improve  my grade with the explanation "" A disabled child has no place in Gymnasium"" ... so I had to go to Hauptschule.

There I had a lot of good teachers and got the rare chance to switch to Gymnasium after 2 years (not a normal path) graduated and went to university


Years later after earning my master's I decided to send a copy of my diploma/degree to Ms Baker with a nice letter that the tone-deaf disabled pupil has now a master's degree. I am only sorry that she died before I got my PhD....

2020-11-16 16:10:44+00:00,3263,She ruined a surprise party on purpose,LuLuLoopy,"This happened when I was a kid, I was just reminded it of, I was about 11 and my grandmother was about to turn 75. Our family is pretty scattered around but we made a trip every year to see her in the summer while she was alive and have a family reunion.

Now this particular year my mom who is granny’s daughter, suggested we all return the month after the family reunion for her birthday and a family dinner. My moms brother and her niece (not that brothers daughter but daughter to her dead brother) immediately jumped all over the plans, invited half the town and turned it into a massive surprise party, excluding my mom from the plans.

My mom said nothing in the plans continued, we went for the usual, scheduled trip and the family reunion. We returned next month in time for the party. It was much bigger than intended and I kept noticing my mom had this cat that ate the canary smirk on her face the entire time.

We stayed in town about a week to spend time with her and when we all were leaving one of my aunts remarked that we really surprised Granny, it was then my mom started cackling like the wicked witch of the west. It turns out that when we were there previously, my grandmother was sad that we were leaving, She told my mom that she didn’t want everyone to leave until my mom took the opportunity to tell her “don’t be sad we’re coming back in a few weeks for your birthday. Don’t tell anybody. It’s supposed to be a surprise but they’re throwing you a massive party.” She told her the location all the details and everyone who was going to be there. Including my uncle whom she didn’t see often.

After telling us all the story and telling us to shut up after we complained, my aunt asked why she’d ruin the surprise on purpose. She just grinned and said “Because (her brother) and (her niece) had no business ruining MY plans!”",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/jv9eru/she_ruined_a_surprise_party_on_purpose/,pettyrevenge,142,0.0
2020-11-15 21:36:22+00:00,2740,Orchid Killer,Jerp69,"Just a heads up, this was typed on mobile and my formatting may not be the prettiest. I was inspired to write this post after my current partner asked if we wanted to buy an orchid and I burst into laughter.



After my freshman year of college, I was looking to move off-campus since dorms are very expensive. A ""friend"" from the dorms called Aiden (Names changed obviously) was very wealthy, and his family bought a townhouse in our college town. He asked for me to move in, and I agreed, especially because it would be significantly cheaper than most off-campus housing.



I ended up moving into the basement, and Aiden and another guy were upstairs. I soon found out how neurotic Aiden was. He was a neat freak, and prone to anger issues. I don't consider myself very messy, but he was on a whole other level. No kitchen electronics could be on the counters and had to be put away at all times, including toasters, coffee machines, and water heater. No big deal, some people don't like clutter. He also insisted on having the entire sink cleaned and empty after every meal, before you ate. He would throw my pots on the table while I was in the same room eating, telling me to ""fucking clean up after yourself"" continuously. He would also get frustrated if he came home to cook and I was already making a meal, and tell me to hurry up, can I not cook faster, etc. Until I was done.



Eventually, I had enough of this bullshit. Aiden had a girlfriend at the time name Melissa, and she was from a middle-class family from California. She eventually moved in due to issues with her own roommates, and would harass me as well when her boyfriend was not there, lecturing me about how I need to sweep and mop after every meal I make since I make a mess. Even a cold cut sandwich.



They eventually decided to get flowers for the townhouse. These were not your average supermarket flowers, but from florists in the area who charged a pretty penny. Aiden's family would cover the costs, and they got several plants, their favorite being this giant white orchid that is longer than my arm. It sat in the middle of the kitchen table. Aiden and Melissa took care of this thing every day, buying it plant food, measuring out water for it, everything you can think of.



One day, I was eating dinner with a cup of hot chocolate, and I accidentally spilled my hot chocolate near the plant. Aiden was watching TV, came in because of the noise, and LOST HIS MIND. He was screaming about how I am going to replace this expensive orchid if it dies, how I can't take care of anything and don't care about his belongings, and tried threatening eviction. (The property was managed by a third party company who I signed the lease with, so I knew he couldn't evict me without due cause, as I was a model tenant who paid every month on time through the portal, kept my space clean, didn't smoke inside, no pets, etc). That was the last straw.



The following week, I set up an alarm at 3am, and I would go upstairs from my basement abode, and pour salt on his plants. A little bit at a time to make sure they wouldn't die immediately.



His Orchid began to wither, slowly at first, and him and his girlfriend spent countless money and energy trying to keep it alive. Alas, I salted that fucker to death over two weeks, along with every other plant in the house.



They bought another Orchid, and I gave it a week before I started my process again. Killing yet another beautiful and expensive Orchid. They repeated this process four more times, until Aiden's family refused to get anymore because they couldn't take care of their plants.



The best part was, with their last Orchid, I came home from classes one day to find Melissa and Aiden pouring their expensive plant food holding up the wilted, dying plant, as Melissa screamed through her sobs, ""WHY can't I keep this FUCKING PLANT ALIVE???"" As Aiden glared at me, interrupting their grieving process. I RAN my ass down to my room and burst into laughter, and never saw another plant in that house for the rest of my lease.

Edit: a few typos, and to clarify. They did not water it everyday, but they did make sure it was the right humidity levels and measured out water. We live in a very dry state so you have to take extra care for plants. Also, fuck Aiden.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/juu2h2/orchid_killer/,pettyrevenge,220,0.0

So thankfully now he doesn't hit me but we have conflicts every now and then.

The revenge
So we have a PS4 I mostly play on it but he plays on it sometimes too. I downloaded this app for pc called netcut which lets you control the internet from devices connected to it. So I inacted my plan. So Everysingle time he tried to play (he plays modern warfare) . id let him play a bit then turn his internet off on the ps4. Oh your in an intense fight whoops the internet went off. Oh your almost about to win whoop your internet's gone. Sometimes I'd even say to him while he's lagging is the internet working?

2020-09-12 23:00:08+00:00,2634,I left my cheating ex on the top of a mountain,sushi-_-lady,"
I’ve been on reddit for a while now but have never had anything noteworthy to post so I’m excited about this despite it being a shitty time in my life, also I’m on my phone so sorry if it’s getting messed up. This happened a few hours ago and I still have a bunch of adrenaline 

So I’ve (f20) been dating this guy (m22) for a little over a year now and its been nice even though we have our differences. I love to work out (I mean I run up and down 14ers in my free time) and he’s always been sorta lazy and out of shape but is still easy on the eyes so it’s never been an issue. Recently though my girl friend was at a bar with some of our other mutual friends and coincidentally, and luckily, saw him out with the boys as he said he would be...but his ex was there with him along with some other girls. She figured they just ran into each other, he’s never done anything suspicious before but I guess I’ve been a bit too trusting. She said she just kinda looked over there occasionally but decided to text me when they were a liiiiittle too close. I called him because like wth he said he’d just be with the boys and he said he’d be home when he got home and hung up. At this point I realized that I hadn’t been paying much attention to his behavior (not him, we literally live together) being preoccupied with college &amp; work and everything that I’ve brushed off fell into place and I realized he was most definitely hooking up with his ex. He always stayed out late, would ignore my texts and calls for hours, hung out with his “friends” but never invited me and has always been ridiculously protective of his phone saying he wants to live his own life and it’s private which I should’ve called him out on but I’m way too naïve I guess. This was my first real relationship. 

Anyways! He got home way late like 3am, I hadn’t heard anything from my friend or him but had been staying up plotting my revenge because a break up over this type of thing isn’t enough. I demanded that he give me his phone and when he refused I straight up said “then pack your shit and leave,” he’s not in the contract, just been staying with me and my roommate and giving me rent since covid started. I guess he didn’t realize I would actually say something like that, I’ve always been super gushy over him and basically tend to his every need, clearly I would never be the one to break us up. He gave me his phone and I didn’t know where to start but eventually found a messaging app I’ve never heard of and sure enough when I opened it the first name to pop up was his ex. Turns out they met almost every weekend for drinks or a restaurant and most definitely hooked up afterwards as well as sent some *pics* to each other. I was pissed buuuuut already had some petty revenge planned. 

He said the classic shit like “I can be better, I never meant to hurt you” “I’m so sorry, you’ve been nothing but good to me” and the infamous “I can change.” I had been waiting for that so I said “prove it, come on my hike with me tomorrow. Show me that you can change your ways and do something I like for once.” I’m fairly manipulative, oops. I’ve been trying to hit a 14er (14,000ft+ mountain for those who don’t live in Colorado) a weekend since the season started and have been fairly successful only missing one week. I had been planning to finally do Long’s Peak but he would definitely not have made it to the top so we did an easier one instead. 

Hiking up he was a bitch and we stopped about every thirty minutes for him making it a very boring 8 hour trip to the top. He was definitely trying to be nicer and sweeter than he has been but it was kind of just pathetic at that point, I already knew I’d never take back a cheater. When we got to the top he sat down immediately and drank the rest of his water despite me warning him he’d definitely need it for the hike down. I took some obligatory pictures since this was still one I’d never done before then gave him a kiss because goddamn those lips still and said “we’re officially over :)” then turned to start my jog down. He was exhausted and couldn’t keep up for long once we hit the trail again but he was saying a buncha stuff that I mostly tuned out but I heard him say “slow down you’re just gonna have to wait in the car, bitch” to which I said “just call a friend, or better yet your ex.” I’m writing this in the car right now and since I don’t have the reception hopefully it’ll reach reddit while I go home. It was a pretty long hike so I doubt he’ll be home for a while (he does have reception and there’s a water fountain at the trail head, I made sure, I’m not too much of an asshole). Idk how things will turn out when he comes to get his stuff and where he’ll go after but I might update this if anything interesting happens. I’m really happy despite everything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/irmq33/i_left_my_cheating_ex_on_the_top_of_a_mountain/,pettyrevenge,847,0.0

So this happened about 10 minutes ago. I'm a (14yo) male and I was in line in a pizzeria, oh wait, The PIZZERIA, I live in a small village and we don't have global pizzeria chains, to be honest i live in a country that pratically doesn't have pizzeria chains (italy)! They're all individual. This is the best pizzeria here, nice ingredients , super good flavour and mid-prices. So i was finally first in line and this old 70ish year old piece of garbage gets first i told him i was first and if he coild please let me, and he said: ""Shut up! I'm older than you! I go first!"". The cashier was taking a phone order and she wasn't looking, so he got his order first. I however know this pizzeria too well.... 
You know there's NOT a good way to tell the chef what pizza is before, they just give you a ticket with your order and your name and you put it on a table in line where the cook take it. So after this old crap puts his ticket in front of this looooong line i go after him and put my ticket before his. After 30 minutes i finally got my pizza. Before him.
He stood up and said:""wait i was waiting for 20 minutes and this kids gets his pizza before me? Even if he ordered after?""
I smiled with my pizza box in hand and said:""shut up. I'm smarter than you, i go first."" With the most ass looking smile i could do, and now i'm home writing this eating my pizza with my dad and mom, my mom is shouting at me because i'm the phone but ya know? After what i did, i don't care if she gets angry, i am happy for my sweet, little, petty revenge

He was like no he'll try to get by with his phone providers internet and hotspots and all that. Now at that moment I told him that it likely would be cheaper to just share the wifi with me than to pay a lot for limitless fast internet (at least in my country). But he said no again so I didn't list wifi as one of the extra costs like water. 

Fast forward to him moving in. His move-in day was during my holidays, so I wasn't around. But I gave him an extended list of information and remained available via phone. While on the beach chilling and getting burned to a nice fire brick red, I suddenly realized that I had written the wifi password on the black board in our shared kitchen. So I was like he most definitely is using the wifi without paying.

Cue my petty revenge: I hurried back to the hotel and got on my internet providers webpage. I slightly changed the wifi password and kicked every device that had been connected with the old password out. And then I waited. It took only 30 mins for that weasel to ask me if something was wrong with the wifi. I straight up told him I changed the password since he had told me he wasn't going to use it. His response: he was just trying it out to see if it was faster than his phone's. Sure, buddy.

He's still my roommate and we have a great time together even though I always tease him with this story.

Edit: I gave him the new password immediately and since then he has been using the wifi and paying for it like a good roomie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/hwivvf/roommate_thinks_he_can_get_free_wifi/,pettyrevenge,153,0.0
2020-07-23 01:16:56+00:00,5267,Don’t wanna pay OT? Fine by me.,oopspoopsdoops6566,"I worked for a company that would never pay over 40 hours. Whatever day you reached 40 hours you were done for the week. Not a bad policy honestly, I’d usually work 10-12 hour days and have a 3 or 4 day weekend. That was all fine until the owners son stepped in. We’ll call him Jay. 
The nepotism was strong with this one. His parents had coddled him and put him in positions he had no where near the experience for. Instead of being humble and asking guys who had been around awhile what was up. He just came in and acted like the hot shot, gods gift to the world.

The issues started when he started taking contracts that involved switching over power from one system to another at large grocery stores. To keep it from getting technical this mainly involved the stores front line POS systems. Working 40 hours and cutting out when reached no longer worked. Sometimes we’d have to work 10 hours of OT which then they would say wasn’t approved and wouldn’t pay. I tried bringing it up to Jay but he’s make comments about how it was because we were screwing around and just wanted to milk the jobs. The truth was, once change over started you couldn’t stop working until done. The worst thing that could happen was the Point of Sale stations were down come opening. Work would start at 9pm and sometimes end at 7-8am with almost always no breaks or lunch. 

After doing 3 change overs and working OT with out getting paid for it, I’d finally had enough. I talked to Jay and told him that he needs to come out for a night and see what we are up against. He flat out refused. Jay told me to stop pissing and moaning and that the work wasn’t that difficult. He said he could do it in 1/2 the time I could. That was my breaking point. I devised my plan for later that night. The Pre-con meeting started at 8pm. Work started at 9pm. Removing the wiring and old boxes started right away and was usually done by 11pm. 11pm also happened to be the time I’d reach my 40 hours for the week. Jay won’t pay me for OT? Well then I can’t work. He failed to understand this ain’t a hobby. At 11:15 when the demo is done, I packed up my tools and quietly slipped out the door. I turned off my company phone and dropped my van off at the shop. I went home and enjoyed a nice week off before starting my new job. Through the grape vine I heard the GC started blowing up Jays phone once he realized I wasn’t coming back. Jay showed up and apparently had it all finished by 3pm. Unfortunately for Jay the contract stated any delays on the POS station would incur back charges to the company to pay for lost sales. 

In the end, I got a new job and a raise, the company had to pay $12,000 in lost revenue to the store, they lost the contract and Jay got to eat shit for about 12 hours.

2020-07-21 18:13:16+00:00,4420,"Teacher wouldn't let me use the restroom, I got HER suspended",valpaljoy,"The title explains it. To preface I have crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This qualifies me as disabled and so starting when I first got sick in hs I was required accommodations by state law. Being disabled was hard and pretty complicated since after being diagnosed with IBD I started getting various other health issues ranging from kidney issues to neurological issues to fibromyalgia. My school was very reasonable, and even after missing 3 months when I was first diagnosed I still got all of my credits.

The following year I was doing alright. Then second semester one of my teachers left and the new one was a complete monster. She refused to teach with the textbook and used wikipedia instead. Wouldn't give us any tests or practice for the AP exam we were due to take, I was very frustrated and felt unprepared. She absolutely loathed me since I had a little pink pass that allowed me to take my meds in class, go to the nurse as needed, and have unlimited restroom breaks. She thought I was a disruption. I would do my best to wait until she was done talking unless I was in too much pain, but she would always roll her eyes and groan at me. One day I had just gotten in from a doctor's appointment and rushed into her class. I asked to go to the restroom and said I'd be right back. She said no. Well asking is just a formality. All of the teachers get emails about the disabled students and know about their accommodations. So I told her, ""I need to go to the restroom, I'm going."" 

As I left she groaned something about me always wasting class time and faking it. I picked up my stuff and took it with me. I went to the restroom. Then I went downstairs to my Dean's office. I signed in and when he came out to get me I told him about her attitude and how she refused to let me use my accommodations so I came here. I simply told him that they should let her know that she's required to let me leave the class for a reason and I have medical paperwork to back that up. He apologized profusely and called the teacher. He told her that he was sending a substitute to her room and he wanted to speak with her. Then he called for a substitute teacher on his walkie talkie. She arrived at his office looking very displeased to say the least. He sent me out of the room and I waited in the lobby for I think 20 minutes. Once she left he had her stop at the desk to fill out some paperwork. He brought me back into the office to fill out paperwork too about what had happened. A few other students who heard what had happened came in as witnesses and after that she was gone for 3 weeks. 

To my knowledge she was suspended bc she opened them up to a potential lawsuit. Blatantly denying a disabled student their accommodations is against the law here, and the school didn't tolerate it one bit. I will admit I do feel a little bad, but I don't take any shit when it comes to my body and my diseases.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/hvck7c/teacher_wouldnt_let_me_use_the_restroom_i_got_her/,pettyrevenge,502,1.0

2020-07-20 15:41:46+00:00,5724,You want to slighty insult me? I'll slightly ruin your flight.,NotBattleTested,"This is something I am surprisingly proud of and easily the most petty thing I've done in my life. TL;DR at the bottom.

About a year ago, I was on a short domestic flight (around 3-4 hours). I was seated towards the front of the flight and lined up to board when they called for my group. I saw I had a window seat and as I saw where I was sitting I noticed an older woman in the aisle seat of my row and who I learned to be her daughter (maybe late 40s) in the middle seat. I let them know I was sitting next to the window and apologized for making them get up so I could sit down. The older lady didn't seem to understand what I was saying at first and she just kept smiling at me, until her daughter told her to get up because they have to let me get past them. The older woman got up and told me not to worry about it, but her daughter seemed extremely annoyed when she told her to move for me. 

I didn't mind at all and apologized once more for being too big to fit past them without them having to get up and once again the older lady gave me a big smile and told me not to worry about it. Unfortunately the daughter was nowhere near as happy as her mother.

This is the point where the daughter started to fire off comments to her mother that were directed at me, pissed off at the fact that since I have a window seat I should have been on the plane before them so they didn't have such a hassle to get back up after they were already seated, etc. Her mother though, didn't seem to pay her any mind. I just ignored her tirade, I did feel guilty that I made them (especially the older lady with the big smile) get up for me. But when the daughter saw her mother was ignoring her, she started to look for anyone around us that she could complain about me to. She even asked the flight attendant for a glass of wine because this 'silly moron' next to her had stressed her out. I put my headphones in and occasionally would pause the movie I was watching on my phone to check if she was still complaining about me. 

Now, I usually have to put up with comments and slight insults for work, I've been called alot worse before and honestly, being called a 'silly moron' is more humorous than anything, so I was just going to let it slide. That's when I noticed as we reached flying altitude that she was trying to see out the window to look down on the city we were leaving. Immediately, I hunched myself forward to block her from seeing out the window and kept watching my movie. Initially I planned to block the window for about 20 minutes but 20 became 30, 30 became 45 and I thought, what the hell, I'm going to fully commit to hunching in front of the window for the entire flight. I saw her getting annoyed but I blasted my volume, held in my pee, skipped the mid flight snack and drinks and continued to block the window until we landed. It was definitely worth it.

*edit: I've just learnt that I should have written it as 3-4 hour flight not 3/4, my bad!

I inherited a horrible roommate when I took over a lease. Didn't get a chance to meet the person before moving in because I was in a rush to find a place. This person never cleaned, ""borrowed"" my dishes without cleaning, ""borrowed"" my food in the fridge and generally a nasty person who was not even willing to talk about the issues, and generally tried best to avoid me, as in no eye contact, no hello, would crank up the music when I knock on the door to try an initiate conversation. 

One habit this person had was to toss their key on the kitchen counter soon as they came in (kitchen counter being right next to the entrance). So I started filing one of the tooth of the key, ever so subtly as to not be detectable. After few days, the key wouldn't work so well so it eventually it would have to be replaced at $10/key (apartment policy to charge $10 to replace the key).

I was shy, naieve, didn't have the wit to say anything back. I didn't have a lot of friends  (I spent most of my spare time reading in my bedroom). So she was constantly saying stuff derogatory to me within ear shot to hurt me.

In  English class, we had to pick a novel and do a presentation on it. 

I read ""I know why the caged bird sings"" by Maya Angelou. I did a monologue in first person. I thought it was great, it took A LOT of courage for me to do that monologue. I did ok. Teacher gave me a high score.

Enter Becky.

This was a year or two after the movie ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was released.

Becky did her presentation on the book she read, ""Dracula"". It was very obvious that she didn't read the book, only watched the movie, and didn't think anyone would notice.

Guess what, Becky. I read the book.

At the end of the presentation, we were allowed to ask questions. She'd already planted questions with her followers, the Becky Posse. They asked, what she thought, would be great thoughtful questions that would show how well she knew and understood the movie, ahem, I mean book.

I raised my hand, she rolled her eyes.

""what did you think of the importance of 'The Bloofer Lady'?""

(I know Lucy was the Bloofer Lady, but I didn't recall it being mentioned in the movie, only the book.)

She went as white as Vampire Lucy, then as red with anger as Gary Oldman's armour.

The teacher, having already known she was presenting the movie and didn't read the book, did a poor job at hiding her smirk. It was awesome.

Becky stammered out a weak generic answer, having no clue who The Bloofer Lady was. Then sat down. I could feel the daggers in the back of my head. 

I didn't care. The knowing smirk of the teacher gave me so much empowerment. I never let anything Becky said after that get under my skin. 

TLDR : Becky tried to do a book report on Dracula, but obviously didn't read it and was presenting her report to the class based on the movie. I humiliated her, exposing her, by asking about a character in the book that wasn't mentioned in the movie.

=**Epilogue**=

She tired once more to intimidate me. She told a Posse follower, within ear shot of course, that she was going to beat me up after school. A boy (handsome, popular) informed her that I was a martial artist, who had won competitions. She huffled that she could still take me. I'm guessing she second guessed herself, and asked around and confirmed that I was indeed a martial artist.

In March, he called and said that his tax guy had figured out that if he filed his taxes as single then he owed over $2000 and if I filed my taxes single then I was paid $400, however if we filed jointly then we’d be paid $450. He offered that if we did so, then he would pay the tax guy for his services and keep the $50 “profit.” At this point, my dad did my taxes for me for free so there was absolutely nothing in it for me.

To set the scene, it's just my mom and I having dinner at the beginning of our time off. She pours herself a glass of wine from an average bottle. (I'm not a wine snob, but she is). I ask for a glass as well to go with dinner, she declines. Her exact words are ""we don't share alcohol in this house"". 

Okay, not a problem, I didn't know this rule, and as I'm not a heavy drinker, I didn't see the issue with just having a glass out of her bottle. 

So, I go on off to the liquor store to grab myself a bottle to drink over the next few days and low and behold, I find her favorite bottle of wine. It's Burrowing Owls. The liquor store only has a case of it and limits the number of bottles you can buy. It's a rare find and I lucked out. I buy the max, which is two, and hid one, while I bring the second inside. 

By now, it's evening, and after dinner. My mom is in the living room finishing her wine. I open the bottle and bring both the bottle and a glass to the living room. My mom eyes up the bottle and asks for a glass. I look her dead in the eyes and say ""Sorry mom, we don't share alcohol in this house!"" She offers me two of her bottles for mine, says I won't know the difference, but I stand firm, we don't share alcohol in this house. So I force myself to finish the bottle in front of her while she sulks. 

Christmas morning, after my family has opened up all our gifts, I come out with the second bottle as a gift to my mom. She shared it with me that night.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/h8zk20/we_dont_share_alcohol_in_this_house/,pettyrevenge,242,0.0

My dad is an avid beer drinker and has an old-school mentality, and he believes that young women only like fruity alcohol. He saw my alcohol preference as proof of the stereotype that young women only like fruity alcohol. Despite some of his old-school opinions, we have a good relationship, and I am his drinking buddy when I come home for a weekend every once in a while.

One weekend, I decided I wanted to try beer just because I actually have never been offered one. When I asked for a beer, he made a big deal out of it and said, ""Girl's don't like beer. It's a manly drink. I can give you one, but you probably won't like it."" He gave me some weird shitty IPA beer and honestly it didn't taste the best. His stereotype has been confirmed, now with more evidence and data. However, my feminist buttons have been pushed and I made it my mission to find a beer I did like.

The next time I came home, he had some wheat beer in the fridge, his favorite kind. When he offered me a glass of wine or cocktail, I declined and instead went to the fridge and picked out one of his precious wheat beers. It tasted fabulous, and I had a couple more cans. He was not well stocked on his beer supply due to him being the only one drinking it, so both of us ended up drinking his entire beer supply in a couple of hours. After we ran out, he still wanted to drink but all that was left was some girly fruity spiked seltzer...he had no choice but to drink the girly drinks.

So when I was in third grade, think 8 years old, I had this teacher who was retiring at the end of the year and knew it. She decided that she didn't like me, for some reason.
So I have a very popular white girl name. For sake of posterity I'm gonna use a fake name here. 

Let's say my name is Baylee. Pronounced ""bay-lee"". Pretty straightforward right? Well this teacher always, always pronounced it ""bah-lee"". It hurt, cause I was like 8 and wanted to be called my own name.

 When I asked her why she pronounced my name wrong, she said it was because of her accent. Ok, fair. 

However, I had a classmate named Kailey. Somehow, that accent disappeared and she was able to pronounce her name perfectly fine. 

Once I heard her call Kailey by her proper name I went right up to her, with all my 8 year old bravery, and asked her why she wouldn't say my name right but would say hers right. 

She didn't answer me, like legitimately ignored me.

Ok, my turn.

So this teachers last name was something like ""tay-ner"". That was the way it was pronounced. and on the first day of that year, she made sure that we knew it was pronounced ""tay-ner"" and not ""ton-ner"" or ""Tanner"". 

So guess who was called ""Mrs. Tonner"" for the rest of the year?

Enjoy trying to leave.,klokwerkz,"So a little background, on many Texas beaches you drive right out on the beach and park along the shore and enjoy your day. Where I grew up, we did the same but you needed a 4x4 because the sand was soft and you would get stuck otherwise. Many Texas beaches are hard packed and it amazes me to see sedans and small crossovers driving on the beach. Onto the story. 

I was on the beach with my family when the inevitable bowel movements need to happen with my 6yo. The drive back to the restrooms is about a mile, so we hop in the truck and make our way back while my wife and 9yo stay behind with our canopy and beach stuff.  When I return there is a little CRV or RAV4 type car parked pretty damn close to where I had originally set my truck up. My wife said she told the man driving that I had just run down to the restroom and I'd be right back, asking if he could move down a little, and he literally shrugged her off. On to the pettiness.

If he wasn't in the mood for discussion, I figured passive aggressive was the way to go. I pulled my truck back into *the exact* spot it had been in before I left. This meant the other guy could not get into his passenger side doors. I was parked parallel to the shoreline so I was good. Deciding I hadn't really messed his day up enough, when I left I made sure to spin my tires right behind his car to create soft sand and rough terrain. When I was done there was little chance his car was going to make it out of his spot without a tow.

Lesson: Don't shrug off my wife.

*Edit for the 3 haters*: I guess I didn't explain well enough the set up. When we parked (early in the morning) we did so parallel to the shore and set up our canopy and anchored it to the truck bed. Anyone who has been to a Texas gulf beach knows there is a constant 11mph wind at your face, no matter which way you turn. When I left, my wife was now holding the canopy, with our chairs, boards, towels, and cooler underneath it.  When I got back I was able to fit my truck between dumdums car and my canopy after a 20 point parallel parking job, leaving a foot of so between my bumper, while the bed of my truck was under the canopy.  I could not pull in straight/back in because the truck would stick out into the ""driving lane"". I could have parked slanted but then wouldn't have an anchor for my canopy, which was still being literally held down by my wife. So I chose to be petty. This isn't AITA, I KNOW I was being a petty asshole in return.

Ok so this is truly a very -small- victory. 
So I got the highest tier of Netflix account so I have the option to have 5 profiles. I have one for me, one for the kids, one for my wife, one as a joint profile for me and my wife and the Last one is for guests (Basically freeloaders). One of the things you can do with Netflix is change the avatar of each profile, which I did for each account while leaving the guest account one of the defaults. My sister in law (crazy, rude, violent, just really a bad person) got permission from my wife to use the guest account, which I didn't mind as long as she only uses the guest account so she doesn't mess up my viewing stats and she understands she shares the account with more people. One day I've noticed that she changed the profile picture of the guest account to some actress from some show she was watching and for some reason it really annoyed me... so like the mature adult that I am I've change the profile photo to some ugly creature from some other show. Such a stupid little victory - if you're going to use my account for free you will use the ugly profile! Every few weeks she will try to change the pic again so I know she cares, but I will quickly notice and change it to something even uglier! The last one was the Demogorgon from stranger things. It's really petty and small but it's fun to imagine her frustration to have to choose some ugly creature as the account she uses...

In my twenties I had the misfortune of falling in love with wrong 'un. He was always in debt (because the bank was 'messing him around'), unfaithful ('she's lying, I never slept with her') and full of get-rich-quick schemes that his parents had to bail him out of.

He was also incredibly beautiful, very vain, and fastidious about his looks. He worked out religiously, wore the most expensive clothes, and continuously told people how large his biceps...and other things...were. That kind of guy...

I, on the other hand, was about 10 pounds overweight and not interested in having a six pack, perfect eyebrows and a tiny waist. So he was always insulting me about that. Not openly but small, continuous digs at my size, shape and weight. Insinuating that he could do better.

I found out one day that he was being unfaithful...again. And it was the last straw. Unfortunately we lived and worked together at his business (a hotel) so I had to find a new job and a place to stay. I didn't want to break up until I had.

One of my few skills was invisible mending, which had come in very handy at the hotel. So, every few days for six weeks I altered his clothes. I took in the waists by tiny amounts, and let out the chests and sleeves. I even let out his underpants so they became looser in the front. I got brave one week and took up the legs of his trousers so he thought he was getting shorter. He was too vain to tell anyone his 'problem'. Instead he went to the gym more, measured out his food more fastidiously, and became really irritable. As time went on he broke up with his mistress, refused to go out, flung himself on the bed in despair more than once.  And started to insult MY looks even more to make himself feel better. And still I continued. A few millimetres here, a few millimetres there. By the end he had convinced himself that he had a Very Weird Shape. And the way I had altered his clothes, it really looked like he did. He went out and bought new ones. I altered them too.

Six weeks later I found a new job and apartment and moved out one day when he was out. I have not spoken to him since. I often wonder if he ever realised what had happened.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/h7fpym/insult_my_looks_weight_and_fitness_and_i_will_get/,pettyrevenge,111,0.0

I haven't gone to the store much in the past few months so while I was trying to remember the PPE order of operations I absent-mindedly let my keys slip from my lap to the cup holder.

I'm all kitted up and go get my stuff from the lockers and head back to the car. I start patting my pockets and feel that little ball of fear rolling around the pit of my stomach. I started walking faster and as I get to my car I see my keys in the cup holder.

I'm standing there staring through the window while sweating buckets from a 3 minute walk annoyed but I contact roadside and get a truck dispatched quickly.

As I am leaning against the front of my car a van comes down the lane on the opposite row and pulls into the spot right in front of my car. As the driver starts pulling closer to my legs I shout ""hold it"" and put my hand out. She stops the van about a foot and a half from me and looks pissy. Like hitting me would have inconvenienced her plans for the day. I look around at the nine other open spots all next to or behind her in the area and gesture towards them. She gestures at me and mouths ""why?"" . I guess she was asking me why I'm just standing there and despite it not being any of her damn business say I'm locked out of my car.

She sits in her car for five minutes just adding to the heat around me while I dick around on my phone. Eventually she gets out, scowls at me and goes inside. About twenty minutes after she went in my tow  truck shows up but it's on the lane opposite me. I was feeling a bit petty so I stopped the guy right behind the van not thinking anything would come ofbit.  Well right as he goes to get the tools van lady comes out of the store. She was lividly muttering to herself as she gets in her car and turns it on. I explain the basics of the situation and he looks around at all the other still open spots in sheer confusion when a shit eating grin comes across his face. He starts opening the door taking a few extra minutes to make sure ""he does it right"" and then has me sit in his air conditioned cab while he fills out an order form because ""his phone was acting up"".

The dude took probably an extra ten minutes to do his job while van lady is stewing in her annoyance. I appreciated the solidarity and threw him a few bucks for the service. He then made sure I got to leave first before rolling out.

Dear Tow truck guy, you rock.

TLDR: Van lady gets in my space with plenty of other choices. Truck driver wastes her time.

Edit: some quick answers:

 I lock my door by hitting the door lock button on the door upon exiting the car. I may start using the key to lock but I hate that damn confirmation honk the car gives. 

I didn't call a tow truck I contacted my insurance who contacted a tow company who had a driver dispatched with door opening tools. 

In parking lots there are usually two sets of parking spaces separated by a line. I was parked away from every other car. She decided to park in the space right in front of my car and was driving towards my legs. Not sure how much clearer I can make that.

Edit 2: To everyone who commented it's possible to turn off the locking horn. You have just changed my life! Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/h794fq/you_want_to_invade_my_space_with_your_car_while_i/,pettyrevenge,227,0.0
2020-06-11 13:02:46+00:00,2812,Mean old woman gets the train horn,Brewergrupenfurher,"
I’m a lover of cheap old automobiles. I had recently scored an 80’s dodge pickup in slight need of repair.

So after a few repairs it was road worthy. But with the addition of a 3 belled train horn mounted to a 3 gallon air compressor and tank for that big rig feel. 

Now I don’t look for a reason to use the horn as it actually hurts my ears to use it. But sometimes people need a louder second indicator they’re in the wrong. 

So this story begins with me driving the ole dodge and coming up to a red stop light. A single white Ford Focus is already sitting there, as I pull up behind, the drivers arms start flailing. I’m thinking they’re on the phone and doing the Italian thing and talking with hands. Given I’m easily 8’ behind the car and not bumper humping or anything to aggravate the driver. Well the light turns green and the driver moved about 3’ forward, I had reacted to the driver and light. So now I’m stuck too close to their bumper and can’t go around, arms flying again. Clearly this person is pissed about something, but I have no clue what. I give a slight horn honk (original horn still works), to indicate that myself and about 10 others are stuck behind this person. She moves forward another 5’ and jumps on the brakes, same as last time I thought we were going and not playing games. So I’m stuck on her bumper again and can’t go around. This time everyone behind me is pissed and honking like crazy, I give in a let a few normal horn honks go to say it’s not just me you’re screwing over. We’re also sitting in the middle of the intersection at this point. Driver is now super upset about something and starts blasting the bird out the car window. Well now I’ve had enough, I flip the red aircraft style switch cover and arm the horn, and then release all 110 decibels of train horn fury upon this poor soul who picked the wrong car to mess with today. She quickly floored it through the intersection and made it all of about a 1/4 mile before she started driving irrationally again. This time slowing to a turtles pace, I’m guessing to allow the line of traffic through the intersection. I don’t fall pray to the start stop games again and go to the shoulder to pass, as I get up next to her I see a little hunched over old woman flipping me off. Whoops! blasted the horn again as soon as I saw the finger. Now proudly in front I drive off to hopefully never see such a shitty driver for a few weeks at the least.

2020-06-10 17:36:07+00:00,2798,Revenge on husband through the tiny doggo.,ToxicFlutter,"On mobile.  

My husband and I adopted a little dog from a humane society shelter in April of 2018. She was estimated to be a year old at the time and had come from a hoarders home.  She is amazing, the best dog I've ever had! Super friendly, adorable, and loves to play. She gets along with anyone and any animal. 

Now here's the thing. She has a couple of very bad habits, and they are hard to break. Had we gotten her as a puppy, I feel as though I would have had an easier time teaching her certain things. She is only 7lbs fully grown (she is 3 now), so husband doesn't see one of her bad habits as a big deal. Jumping. 

I can't stand the jumping. This girl can JUMP, too. All the way to my waist at times. When she's excited, she will jump continuously on you (example, going for walk, car ride, playing etc.) When she wants you to pay attention to her, she jumps. Guest coming over? Jump on them. Sounds cute, but it's not. I've had moments where she will jump on me from behind and hit the back of my knee and I fall while carrying things. I've had moments where she jumped on me while wearing shorts that I got scratched by her nails. And also....tbh.... it's super annoying to me to be jumped on over and over while I'm trying to leave the house to run errands because she wants to go. She rarely does it to me now, because I correct her every time until she stops. But she hasn't stopped with him and she thinks it's OK. Husband doesn't mind it, thinks it's adorable, and encourages her to jump in his arms a lot of times. We haven't argued about it, but i have expressed my concerns with it and that I feel we should be on the same page to train her to not jump on people. 

Fast forward to today. I had corrected her this morning after she jumped on me wanting attention. Husband didn't say anything but saw it. Just a few minutes ago, he stopped me in the hallway to talk to me, and our doggo decides she wants his attention and jumped on him. 

She jumped, and caught him right in the ""bro-varies"" if you will. The crotch nuggets. Family jewels. Meat kiwis. Dong pillows. Whatever you want to call them. She got them. He keeled over and made noises that can only be comparable to an overweight donkey wheezing after running a race. I stood there and watched as his body hunched over and with tears in his eyes, he looked at our precious spoiled doggo and said the words ""Doily, NO JUMP"" before limping away to scrounge the freezer for frozen peas. I think he learned a lesson here. (Doily is her name)

He started asking me about the size of my house and I told him that I keep them in the backyard in a pen, and offered to go outside to get one. I grabbed one of my duck calls and started yelling ""Leonard! Get over here!"" and quacking into the phone.

I received notification that my package was just delivered but it's not there. ""

Driver looking shocked stammering over words ""oh, uh, what's the address?""

Give him address. 

""Yeah I just delivered it to you""

""No you didn't. I'm calling Amazon and y'all can sort this out"" start walking away

Driver calls out ""oh I found your package. But it says there's an issue and I can't deliver it. It's likely a duplicate and another driver will be by later to deliver the correct one""

""Then why did you mark it as delivered""

""Oh because I didn't see there was an error. The other driver will be by later""

""No, I'm calling Amazon now"" walk away called Amazon to report the incident. 

They say nothing is wrong with my package and it's marked as delivered. I tell them about the interaction and they say the driver should've given me the package. Even if it's a duplicate the driver is not supposed to withhold a package. They'll investigate and get back to me in 24 hours. 

2 minutes after getting off the phone with Amazon door bell rings. I happened to be next to the door so open it within 5 seconds to see the same delivery driver hauling ass down my driver. Jumps in delivery van and speeds off through the neighborhood. Look down and my package is there.

Call Amazon again to let them know that I just got the package and it was the same driver who hauled tail. They said they would be opening an investigation into the driver. I also told them about how fast he was driving through the neighborhood. I felt like a Karen calling to complain but truly believe this driver was running a package stealing scam.

For six months straight, I worked the world’s sweatiest and most tedious job as a Food Service Associate, which is fancy Navy speak for, “You clean spit and grime off plates and serve food.” I did this for 13-14 hours a day, 7 days a week, every day for 6 months with a total of four days off. 

Unlike the rest of the ship, however, I worked the night shift. This meant that I along with 24 other people had a totally different schedule from the 600+ other people that also worked on the ship. 

Being that there was, in fact, a night shift, you’d think your shipmates would respect the fact that you also need to sleep and that our 3pm would be the equivalent of their 3am, right? Wrong because they’re monsters and had no concept of common decency. This meant turning all the lights on at 1pm for no reason, coming in and out of the berthing and slamming doors behind them, talking as loudly as they could with no concept of volume control, rummaging through their lockers, leaving their alarms to go off for hours on end, etc. At one point, groups of friends were coming in waves to sit in the middle just to talk after work. 

After months of complaining to higher ups, begging for silence, and literally screaming at these people, the night shift was pretty fucking cranky and exhausted for getting less than two hours of sleep each night. Formal methods just weren’t working. So we figured it was time for some petty revenge. 

We had breaks between meal hours (usually between 12-3), and we’d take that time to go downstairs and pay forward the same kindness and consideration they had for us. We stomped our way down the stairs, slammed doors behind us, dropped our locks, opened and shut our squeaky locker doors as often as we felt like, talked as loud as we could out in the hallways, and some left their alarms locked up and set to go off at inconvenient times with no way to shut them off. 

It took less than a week before everyone started complaining, and we, the night shift, were called into an after hours meeting with our higher ups. They lectured us about the noise level in the berthing and respecting your shipmates and yada yada yada. Our awesome supervisor stepped in afterwards and told them exactly what day shift had been doing, how we were being treated, and that respect shouldn’t be so one sided when we had been complaining for months with no results. 

Long story short, no one was allowed in the berthing during working hours and we were finally able to get at least 6 hours of rest before work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/g1tom6/please_just_let_us_sleep/,pettyrevenge,94,0.0

So I was with a ~~man~~ guy on and off for 2 years, he was physically abusive at times, cheated on me in the flat I paid for at the time and was just an all round dick of a guy. He would never pay towards the bills and I was stuck buying everything and no money left for myself. Me being young (18) and thinking I knew better than everyone I stayed with him. Finally I broke up with him for good as I couldnt take it anymore and I knew I deserved better.

During our relationship, he bought he a phone for my birthday. I never asked for one, or even needed one as my own phone was absoloutley fine at the time. I always thought this was quite strange. Anywho, after the final break up I decided I wanted to get my own phone so I had nothing to remember him by.

So I go to the phone shop to get the phone changed as the rep asks me the provider and my details and such. He runs it through his system and nothing comes up. He calls the network provider and while he is on the phone, he looks at me and laughs. Once done with the call he asks:

Rep: Did you say your ex boyfriend bought you this phone?

Me: Yes, why?

Rep: Are you on good terms with your ex?

Me: Absoloutley not! I hope to never see him again.

Rep: Well I think you'll be happy about this. You see, the direct debit is to your bank account BUT the contract is in his name. Which means all you have to do is cancel the direct debit and it will switch back to the original which is his.

Me:..... how much is left to pay on the contract.

Rep: £450.

Me: Sounds good to me. I think Ill cancel the debit from my account.

And with that, I canceled the debit from my account and got myself a new contract under my own name.

Probably nothing compared most people's posts on here but I felt a small win for all the abuse he gave to me. About a month later he messaged me on social media after making a fake account asking why he has money coming out of his account for the phone?

He goes to a community college, and he was taking some required communications class his first semester. He had to give a persuasive presentation, so he went with vitamin supplements. The point of his presentation was that we get the vitamins and minerals we need from food already so taking vitamin supplements is a waste of money for most people and that the things aren't even FDA regulated, etc., etc.

An important thing to note is that he quoted his mom in the presentation because she is a nurse and backed him up on his points. This was definitely not his only source or even the most important one, but added some credibility and maybe a little flavor to the presentation.

Next class, another student gives her presentation. It just so happens to be on how important vitamin supplements are and how, really, we should all be taking many, many more of them. My partner was just sort of amused at this point until she reached a slide in her presentation specifically stating that nurses are not a credible source on this subject. A bunch of heads turned his way at this because yeah, she just basically attacked his credibility and his mom at the same time. Now it was personal.

He doesn't really know how to handle this until she reveals that her credibility comes from the fact that she works for a certain supplement distributor that is, shall we say, less than reputable? There it is. He finds his opportunity.

When it's time for questions, he raises his hand. She looks a little reluctant to call on him, but does. He just casually asks if the company she works for is a Multi-Level Marketing company (MLM). She just sort of abruptly confirms that it is. My partner doesn't say anything else, just sort of looks at her knowingly. That already pisses her off. Then, some other student pipes up and says ""wait, that's a pyramid scheme!"" Pretty soon the discussion just dissolves into how MLMs are really just pyramid schemes and everything that particular scam entails. The woman giving the presentation just glares daggers at my partner before she quickly goes back to her seat.

Like I said, I'm very proud of him.

TL;DR My partner gives an anti-vitamin supplement presentation, other student gives pro-vitamin supplement presentation and refutes both my partner's and his mom's credibility in the process. He points out the vitamin supplement company she works for is an MLM. The rest of the class catches on that MLM means pyramid scheme.

Nothing super fancy, just a membership-based non-profit that owns a plot of land with a pool. One of the things we loved was it had a specific kid pool, for ages 5 &amp; under. 

I met my wife Saturday afternoon after I did some yard work, and the weather was brutal. This was the end of July, pushing 100F with matching humidity. 

We're in the kiddie pool area supervising our kids, as is the rules, with my wife and I taking period turns to jump in the bigger pool. One of the times while I was watching the kids, and older kid was sneaking up on smaller kids with a super-soaker style water gun and blasting them. 

The first time it happened to my oldest, 3-years-old, I said ""Tell him to stop and you don't want to play with him."" She did that, and I was proud. Not 2 minutes later he did it again. 

I yelled at him, ""Do not spray her or any other kid again unless they are playing with you."" 

He sprayed another kid that went crying to his mother (not in the kiddie pool area, despite the rules). I immediately went into the 3 feet of water and took the kid's gun and said I would only give it to a parent. He burst into tears and ran off. 

He came back with a mother and the pool manager, pointed at me, saying I took his toy. The mother started laying into me, etc. 

By now my wife is back, and we're drawing attention. When she stopped, I was silent. She asked ""Are you going to say something or just look stupid?""

""I was just waiting for you to finish. I found it's best to let children just rant and tire themselves out.""

I then explained what had happened. Another parent that had been in the pool backed me up. 

The pool manager then asked the mother why she wasn't supervising her son in the kiddie area, since all children 5 and under needed to be supervised.

""Because he's 7, you idiot.""

""He's not allowed in the pool, and you know that. This is the third time you've ignored the pool rules this week. You will have to leave for the day.""

Then she went into another rant about how it was the hottest day of the year, she pays for the manager's salary, they don't have AC at home, etc. 

When her husband showed up with their older son he looked so embarrassed. I gave him the gun. 

The manager gave my kids free ice cream.

Its nice to sit and have a coffee and get ready for the day on the way in. In the trains, most seats will fit two people, except for the end car seats, which can fit up to four.

And the trains fill up on the way in and usually people end up having to stand in the aisles if they have the misfortune of getting on at the later stops. Luckily, I have an early enough stop that there's always seats available.

I noticed that there was one guy who was getting on and then taking one of the end car seats and then spreading his bag and computer and everything else out across the seat so no one else could sit in the end car seat.

So I've made it my goal every morning to find him on the train and before he's able to pull all his crap out and spread it all over the seat to seat down right across from him.

We had a kitchen, a couple bathrooms and 2 large (about 3 acres) outdoor areas where the smokers would take their breaks.

One guy would light up his cigarettes at his desk, finish his call and then head outside, leaving a trail of smoke as he passed my desk.   I didn't care if he smoked, but not in the office and especially, not near my desk.

One Monday, I went into work with  a nasty head cold, and his cigarette smoke bothered me even more.   I asked him about a dozen times before lunch to please wait until he was outside to light up.  He always said he would, but conveniently forgot EVERY TIME.

Back then, when you got a pack of cigarettes, the clerk gave you a book of matches.  This guy lit his smokes with matches.  He usually bent a stick backwards and struck it with his thumb, one handed, while writing with his other hand.  He did this without looking at the matches.   This is how I got my revenge.

When he went out to get his lunch, I went to his desk and lit every match at his desk, and then blew them out.   He comes back from the store and eats his lunch.  He picks up the phone and makes a call.   As his call is winding down, he puts a cigarette in his mouth and gets a book of matches and tries to light it.  Nothing.   He tires again...nothing.   He tries one last time with that book and still nothing.   He's frustrated and gets off the phone.

He gets another book of matches and is now using both hands trying to strike a match to light up.  He can't.  (note- he should be outside now).   He tries 3 or 4 times and can't get a match to fire up.  I ask him if there's a problem?

He says, ""yeah, these gosh damn motherfucking worthless piece of fucking shit matches don't work"".   He says this as he's walking outside to ask someone to borrow a lighter.  As he passes my desk I say, ""that's funny, they worked a minute ago"".

He gets a couple steps outside before what I said sinks in.  He comes back inside and stands in front of my desk and opens the book of matches.  He sees they're all black and burnt.   He starts to curse me out but stops.  He smiles, realizing why I did that.  He just nods and goes outside.   He started leaving his matches outside at the table, that way he'd have to be outside to light up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/drm5by/matches_they_work_more_than_once_right/,pettyrevenge,97,0.0

It turns out while asking me to give this stuff up  she had been cheating for the last 2 of the years with her scum bag boss.  She tried to throw a fit and smear my name and justify it, but no one bought it, even her brother and best friend were on my side, I almost died from bhs during the whole thing, cause she was actually mentally torturing me, like not intentionally i hope, but was text book with the alternating reinforcements, bad and good, and then baiting me into things and then blaming me, like sleeping with her and then blaming me for tricking her, when she was the one coming over, for MONTHS that went on, and I finally shook loose.  
She ended up with the guy cause no one else would talk to her, and after a few years I guess they decided to get married, I asked everyone I knew not to talk to me about her, cause it was painful and basically I was just trying to live my life at that point.  Well as a fuck you to me she sent me an invitation to her wedding, and it made me angry, but instead of tearing it up, i just kept it, i put it in a box with other stuff from our relationship, kind of as a warning if i ever felt nostalgic or toyed with getting her back.  
Well shes a cheat and hes a scum bag liar, so of course the marriage only lasts like a year and goes down in flames, and I see this because one of our old mutual friends mentions it, and shes signed the papers that day.  So I went right to that box, checked that I would be having the chicken, and a +1, and then mailed back my rsvp.

2019-10-22 20:34:07+00:00,2799,Revenge By The Cat,Zeldaspellfactory,"I went to an out of state college in the Fall of 1987. I spent my last few semesters away at college with a roommate in an apartment rather than in a dorm. It was cheaper and a LOT more fun. Over my last summer, my roommate met a guy. I thought he was a major loser. He was constantly berating my roommate for things she did in OUR apartment. He drank nonstop vodka, whiskey or (If he could get it) everclear (highly potent grain alcohol). I don't think I ever saw the guy NOT acting like a fool.

There was a stray cat in the complex who followed me inside one day. He became my cat for a while. This cat LOATHED the boyfriend. One morning I am woken up by the most horrified scream. Roommate and her boyfriend had 2 hour screaming match the night before. Apparently the cat didn't like that.

He vomited in her shoes AND her boyfriend's shoes. Then he came in to snuggle with me. The loser boyfriend wanted to kill the cat over a pair of shoes or two. I told him that I would neuter him if he came NEAR the cat. I also told him to stop being mean and the cat would stop.  After all, the cat NEVER vomited on or near me or any of my stuff. 

Over the course of that year, my roommate and her loser went through a TON of shoes, several backpacks, MANY shirts left on the floor, and even the occasional random dish of food left sitting for 30-45 seconds. All because of Ralph Kitty. He was an overall very sweet kitty. He didn't jump on counters, he would come supervise me in the shower so that the horrible boyfriend couldn't sneak in to watch me shower, he was super snuggly with me, and he adored my boyfriend. The guy I dated around that time wasn't a cat person, but he LOVED playing with Ralph Kitty. One of their favorite things to do was for my boyfriend to blow bubbles over the railing while the cat was down in the courtyard chasing them. This drove my roommate and her boyfriend NUTS because the cat just refused to do anything with them other than sneak food, vomit, and give them nasty glares. Of course I gave him treats for being mean to the loser boyfriend. 

The absolute worst episode of revenge was right after I took the cat to the vet. He was a long haired cat, so he had hairballs. The main way to treat hairballs? A laxative. The vet dosed him with the laxative and I drove home as fast as I could. I left notes and also told my roommate and her boyfriend that the cat NEEDED to stay locked in my bedroom until the medicine was done in 12-24 hours. I even told them what the medicine was and how it worked. 

They let the cat out and tried to snuggle with him locked in my roommate's room. Who on earth would do that with a cat that just had a laxative? The reason he was put into my room was that he always used the litter box in my room. Of course the medicine worked about 2 hours into my roommate's nap. Ralph Kitty even started it right where she put him - under her covers. I came home to her entire room reeking of cat poop and my roommate tried to blame me for the cat crapping under her covers. I showed her the reminders to not let the cat out, reminded roommate that I told her not to do that (let the cat out), and then asked her what kind of fool tries to snuggle on her bed with a cat who just had a large dose of laxative.

Some background before I get into anything, me and my friend Marko attend a university abroad. We are both from Croatia, but I have an English name and he has a Croatian name. Also, my accent is all but gone as I was raised outside of my home, so he sounds very thick and I sound Croatian only when I speak the language. Furthermore, since we both speak English, we see no reason to speak Croatian unless we are alone as we find it rude to speak our language around those who cannot understand us when we could easily speak English.

So since we are both Croatian and have known each other 10+ years and attend the same classes, we naturally do all of our work together. And in a previous post (a revenge one, check it out if you're interested) we actually got a student expelled from the class, and now this professor sort of has it out for us very subtly. For an ""experiment"" for our 30% group assignment, we were told to group up with people who were members of our race or region. I was like ""meh I'll just take Marko like I've always done and we'll smash it out in a few nights."" Apparently not!

So I registered myself with Marko and a Bosnian dude we knew as an Eastern European group. Easy enough. Professor immediately jumped on my ass and told me: ""Sorry DAULTIM8, you're gonna have to pair with a person from your country for once. Is that such a horrid concept to you? Were my rules unfair?"" I stared at him blankly and told him ""I have chosen. Marko is Croatian too."" He looked at me, laughed rather dramatically and told me that I was as much of a Croat (which is a word that if said wrong can be used as a slur) as himself and unless I magically became Croatian the next day I'd be working with ""Good students who speak English."" Which, seeing as Marko was sitting right next to me was quite rude.

Alright Professor. Easy enough to become what I already am.

That night I went home, printed off birth certificates, collected my passport, driver's license, firearms license, and to really rub it in I brought proof of my military training. (Many Eastern Europeans are encouraged to do a sum of military service after high school, I did my part and then headed to university. Never saw or did anything hero worthy, just smoked in the barracks and gave food and water to poor kids in small countries.) And to FURTHER rub it in I went into the albums and collected a picture of me and Marko as early angsty teenagers.

The next day was wonderful, I walked in and the professor told me that he had assigned me a group of people who I'd be able to actually communicate with. With a smirk, he pulled out a chair for me at their table. I looked at him, walked right up to him, picked up the chair and brought it to the Eastern European side. His jaw was unhinged, dragging along the floor as he walked up to me and asked if I wanted to receive a fail for my ""Sub ordinance and unwillingness to partake in the assignment."" In response, I opened my backpack and passed him the bundle of papers I had accumulated. I then opened my wallet and took out my three licenses, all in Croatian and finally my passport. He sort of stared at the bundle, flicking through, all the meanwhile poor Marko was slowly being marinaded by his tears as he held in his laughter, his face flat on his desk.

Once he was done, he placed the bundle on my desk. At this point, the class around us was rather confused as to what the cause of the ten minute delay was. Seeing this, to nail in the point, I stared the professor in the eye and said as blank as I could: "" Jesam li dovoljno hrvatski da radim sa svojim sunarodnjacima, gospodine?"" Which pretty much means ""Am I Croatian enough to work with my countrymen now, sir?""

The professor, defeated and quite humiliated now simply said ""get to work."" And walked away.

We're handing in the assignment tomorrow.

TLDR: my professor separated the class by race for a social experiment for an assignment, told me I couldn't work with my fellow Croatians because he didn't believe i was Croatian. Showed him my license, passport, military training certificate and other documents and worked with my fellow Croatians.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/dji5i1/im_separating_you_by_race_alright_ill_just_stand/,pettyrevenge,338,0.0

2019-10-16 03:27:43+00:00,3652,Revenge for not cleaning up after your son.,ThomasofHookton,"Sorry this is long…

Background:

My partner (F,30) and I (M,34) live with my biological son (4) (his mother and I are divorced). We live about 3 hours away from the rest of my family.

 

This revenge story involves my cousin (let’s call her Susan) (F,37) and her two boys (5 and 7). I don’t have a very close relationship with Susan but she and I got along well enough. My nephews are overall decent kids, but like many boys their age can be a handful especially when combined together with my son.

Because we live 3 hours away, Susan and I used see each other about once or twice a year, during major holidays. However, at the beginning of this year, Susan’s husband got a job as a ship’s mechanic. So he would often be away, 2, 3 sometimes up to 8 weeks at a time. Since then, Susan has been driving down and ‘dropping in’ on us about once or twice a month. She would often give us very little notice and stay for 2-3 days at a time.

 

While I don’t mind seeing Susan and her boys, she was definitely starting to wear out her welcome. While she stays with us Susan never does any cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking or contributes to the household. She barely even looks after her boys, preferring to sit on the couch or her guest bed on her phone. This leaves my partner and I the responsibility of cooking, cleaning for 3 additional people and also babysitting. The three boys would run around the house and when I ask my cousin to look in on them she ignores me and says, ‘oh they’re just boys having fun. It’s fine! Don’t be such a tiger parent’. When she does get off her ass to look after her boys she just gives them an iPad each. My partner and I are trying to limit the screen time of our son but it’s kind of unfair to restrict his screen time while his cousins are constantly on theirs. So then we’re forced then to take the boys outside ourselves to play (Susan declines to join us – she’s too tired as a single mother). Basically she treats my home as a source of free accommodation, free meals and free childcare.

 

My partner and I grew up in households where we were taught to look after our guests, especially if their family. So we just took Susan’s laziness in stride for a while. The straw that finally broke the camel’s back happened about 10 weeks ago. Susan and her boys were staying over but the youngest boy was obviously sick.  During the night he got up and vomited all over our guest bathroom. In the morning Susan used our bathroom to get ready and then left shortly after. As I was getting around to cleaning up after her (changing sheets, vacuuming etc) I saw the horrendous vomit strewn state Susan had left for us to clean.

 

I called Susan and angrily told her off. Her reply was, ‘I’m a guest and I have to deal with a sick kid. Why don’t you stop whining and just clean it?’. I lost my shit at her and told her to fuck off and never come back. She tried to call me, told on me to my parents and her parents for swearing, she eventually sent me a text apologising. I knew she only wanted to fix our relationship because she wanted to continue to use my house as an AirBnB and free childcare so I ignored her for about 2 months.

 

Then last week I decided to take revenge. I had a reunion with my high school friends in her city. So 2 days before, I called her and told her that I’m sorry about everything that’s happened and that we will always be family. She eagerly jumped at the chance to make amends, thinking that her trips up to our house can start again. Then 1 day before my reunion, I called her and asked if I can stay overnight at her house. She sounded reluctant but had no credible way of refusing given that we had ‘made up’.

 

That night, I got horrendously drunk and had a great time with my friends. I got back to her place in the early hours, and using a toothbrush, made sure that I threw up all in her sink and bathtub. I then left immediately and got on a red eye bus back home. The next morning she blew up my phone trying to call me, sending me angry texts etc. Eventually, I answered and innocently asked, ‘Hi Susan, what’s wrong?’.

‘Fuck you, clean up you spew you asshole.’

I smiled, ‘But cousin, I’m the guest and I have to look after my hangover self. Why don’t you stop whining and just clean it?’ I then hang up. My cousin and I haven’t talked since.

My friends and I were at lunch at work. About 3 of us were deaf out of 8 of us. We were talking and getting by just fine.

I glanced across from me this young couple looking at us. I caught the lady speaking (lip read her) to the guy saying, ""it's funny how deaf people talk. So stupid.""

I wasn't very far from her so i said out loud to my group that ""some hearing people don't get that deafies can read lips. So stupid."" After that, I quickly glanced at them with a glare.

2019-10-15 02:30:17+00:00,7884,Foreign waiter was rude in his language so I returned the favor.,Kei_DidntDoIt,"Tonight I went out with my teacher and a few other students to celebrate us all passing our super hard AP college credit equivalent test. We went to a Japanese style restaurant and for context our waiter was in fact Japanese. We all ordered A LOT of food and we were having a great time when I over heard our waiter talking to another waiter in Japanese. 
He said : “ that blonde girl is so fat she shouldn’t have ordered all that food.” 

As you can guess by now I understood what he was saying because I speak Japanese. In fact everyone at my table speaks Japanese because our teacher is our Japanese teacher and the test we all passed was our AP Japanese language test. My teacher noticed I was just picking at my food and asked what was wrong. I told my teacher and I was upset at first about having been called fat. He must’ve overheard it too and was hoping I hadn’t heard it. He assured me that some people are just rude and that I can eat all I want because we’re all celebrating. Everyone else had ordered a lot of food for themselves too. I was still a little bothered though, and so I hatched my little plan. 

The rude waiter came back and asked us all how everything was. 
I spoke up and said: “ it’s great! We’re celebrating and the food is perfect for us celebrating!” 
He replied: “ oh that’s great. What are you all celebrating?” 
To which I said (in Japanese): “we are all celebrating our passing test scores on our college Japanese language exams. “ 

His face was beautiful. That look of realization and the glance over the table at my smiling peers and my Sensei holding in his laughter. However the waiter did  not apologize for what he had said. So I didn’t leave him a tip on my meal. (Everyone else did on theirs.) on the back of my receipt I wrote: 

話す前に考えてください。

2019-10-14 22:15:53+00:00,2735,Dumpster scare,WaffleRaven,"I work at a petrol station in Australia and we have a limited amount of room for car parks (the ones who don't need fuel). There are 4 parks right in front of the dumpster areas. The dumpsters have high wooden fences and gates around them (to keep them out of sight I suppose) but this means if a car parks really close to them we cannot open the gates to put out the garbage.   


There is always someone who parks way too close when we need to take out garbage. Often it is someone just stopping and checking their phone. Some see me with the rubbish and signal that they are sorry and move back a meter or so for me. Others just stare as if I am the scum of the earth. I've asked people to move in the past and most are more than willing. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm taking out the rubbish and there's a relatively expensive looking car real close to the gates. A foot or so. No way I can open it or squeeze through. I see the driver is in the car and give him a wave to get his attention. He ignores me. I go to his open window and say 

'Excuse me, would you mind backing up a little so I can get to the bins?' 

He responds with. 

'You got plenty of space, don't be lazy'

So that makes no sense on any level. So I shrug and move to the gate. I grab the handle and make a motion as though I'm going to rench it open as hard as possible and smash it into his car. I hear an audible gasp and a honk as he panics and hits the car horn. I turn to him questioningly. 

'You said I've got plenty of room'

He goes red in the face, starts the car and backs up a few feet. I open the gate and chuck the rubbish. But He must have decided he was done and just drives off. I will never understand human beings I swear.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/dhy3b3/dumpster_scare/,pettyrevenge,77,0.0

I'm already a little irked because we tried ordering something basic (hot chocolate), only to be told that they aren't able to make them today. So I quickly chose an alternative, something just as basic (chai tea latte), but they again said their steam wand is broken so their menu is reduced down to practically nothing. That aside, I ended up just not ordering any drinks other than my overpriced breakfast so I can just focus on studying.

Our booth neighbor decides to pound their feet against the floorboards for a long, long time. Since our booths are raised and sharing these floorboards, I can hear and feel everything. So I wanted to test out whether it would be the same for us. I began drumming out a strong beat on the floor with my heeled mules. Lo and behold, my neighbor's pounding stopped.

About a year and a half ago I was working at a company with multiple divisions. We met up for company paid supper one evening at a bar. 

This guy went off on a rant about how millennials are always expecting hand outs and to not earn thier way in life. And that I was a typical millennial and fit that bill perfectly. I should add this guy is only about 3 years older than me. Although he insists that he's not like others his age.

For me to be at this point in my life I saved up every cent I could (about $1500). Took my clothes I had, the tools I had to my name, loaded up a Honda Civic and traveled over 4000 kms accross the country to find a job as an apprentice. I was 21 and left all my friends and family to start a new life in a different city. I started out washing industrial equipment and worked my way up to a heavy duty mechanic at my previous company.

So needless to say I was not very happy with being told that I expected handouts in life and didn't earn what I had. I still miss my family and friends everyday of my life I live here. While he grew up here.

So fast forward a couple of months. He shows up to work hammered drunk. Drove the company truck in, and once he got there started to insult co workers. Obviously this got him in big trouble and he was fired on the spot.

About a year later, my previous company I worked for called me in for work. I sat down to lunch with the boss and found out that they just recently hired this guy. And he was starting next week.

So of course I let them know about his incident that he lied to about them saying he worked for a different branch of the company. Obviously in an attempt to stop them from contacting his real place of employment.

So when he walks into his first day at work their going to turn him right around and send him back out the door.

Fuck you for thinking you know me or what I've done to be where I am in life. Enjoy losing your first job opportunity in a year, maybe if you didn't ""expect handouts""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/dgb2eg/call_me_a_typical_millennial_who_expects_handouts/,pettyrevenge,324,0.0
2019-10-10 08:50:32+00:00,2731,Clean the classroom before doing my job. Hmmm no!,fatjokesonme,"A post I saw yesterday reminded me of this story, don’t know if it belong here, but anyway.

As many know, English isn’t my first language, so grammar nazis just keep it cool.

Here is the story: I was an IT expert in a company that serviced mostly schools, colleges and education facilities in general.

Summer vacation is the perfect time to do general maintenance jobs, as there is little work and no students.

One large school call for a full day job, connecting and configuring a new computer lab. The computers are already on site, so it’s just a matter of connecting some cables and configuring the network, easy. Or so I thought.

I get there and the chief maintenance guy show me into a classroom. It’s a wreck! All the tables are piled in a huge pile on one side of the room, computers are in another room still packed and waiting to be opened, not all are new though, some old and beat up, clearly bought in bulk in some auction, unclear what’s their status.

Note that once I open and install the computer, I am fully responsible for its working condition, no matter how it was before I got there.

On top of it all the room was freshly painted, huge pile of dirt and junk in the middle of the floor, the smell is unbearable. And to top it all, no network infrastructure or even electricity anywhere.

As a specialist, I expect to get the room ready, clean, tables in place hooked up with power and network. I can do most of it myself, but that’s not in the contract and will take a week work, not one day! And I’m not an electrician, so I don’t do power outlets and infrastructure.

First thing I take pictures of everything, the wall of tables, lack of infrastructure, Brocken computers. And send it to my boss with a big question mark. While I wait for him to call me back, I look for the chief guy and ask him what he expect me to do? He just shrugs and say “just clean the pile and install the computers”. What about power? Network? Dunno, don’t understand computers...

My boss calls me and asks WTF is that? I tell him what’s going on here, he just order me to pack my stuff and get back to HQ, it’s not my job to clean the trash or place tables. I mentioned the “new” computer status and he lighten up. We can’t maintain computers who were broke before they bought them. It can void the contract.

So I tell the chief I am leaving, and he is not happy, of course. He try to yell at me, but I just give him my boss number, even suggest I would dial from my phone, save him the call. He calls and start to yell at the boss, that just pull up the contract and claim the site isn’t ready, and by the pictures I sent him, it will not be ready in the next two weeks at least, so he can offer to send an infrastructure crew to get it ready for extra pay, or wait for the chief do call him back and prove that the site is ready.

Oh, and they have to pay for my visit extra. Sweet.

The chief go crazy, start shouting profanities, threatening to get violent on me or any other company tech that will ever get to that school. It was on my phone, and it was recorded.

So I grab my phone and get the hell out of there. From the car I send the recorded call to my boss, who happily charge the school for the visit, before voiding the contract on the base of the tech doesn’t feel safe to work there with such a violent chief.

I didn’t get back to that location, though I think other tech have been there, so I figured things were sorted out eventually.

Did it in a horrible way, but I’ll spare you the details. Basically she didn’t give me any reasons, was super confusing and contradicting, and then told me we were going to have a clean break (not a discussion) and to not contact her ever again. I was distraught as you can imagine. It took a few weeks to finally come to terms with everything and realize this wasn’t something wrong with me, but something wrong with her. But her continuous dodging me when I only wanted to talk and responding to me with these super impersonal messages that read like a work email, I had enough. 

See, for her birthday back in June, I flew down to see her and went all out. I made sure to prioritize “experiences” over possessions since that’s what she was all about, and planned a surprise trip with her friends for a girls trip and got her a ticket to Day 3 of ACL. Well the trip happened a couple weeks ago and I see it all over Instagram from her friends. They’re all very vain people who care most about their social clout, so I was able to see the entire trip like I was there. Afterwards, all her friends are thanking each other for seeing one another and for planning such a great trip.  I still hadn’t heard anything from my ex and wasn’t sure if she was entitled enough to go through with this, but she was. 

Which brings me to the petty revenge. I had dropped off a bunch of her stuff when I got a new job (got the job six days after she broke up with me and went from 22 hours away to 3) and I dropped off her ACL ticket at that time. This was back in September. Remember how I said all she cared about was her social clout? Well this past weekend I see that she’s at Day 2 of ACL and posting all about it. And then Day 3 happens and I see her post Instagram stories about being walking up to the festival grounds and how she can’t wait to see her favorite artists (Lizzo and Cardi B?) and suddenly there’s nothing else after that.

Because I had sold the ticket a week ago. 

It was both amazing and unsurprising that she was that big of a fool and felt that entitled to not see this happening. I haven’t heard anything from her and don’t expect to, but I would have loved to see her get denied at the festival entrance. I guess I could have since I now only live a few miles away from ACL, but she’s not worth that effort. And I also made my money back and more from the concert ticket.

She was in nursing school in the early 70s, and had a med/surg rotation at a hospital. One of the surgeons was known for slapping nurses/students on the butt as he passed them in the hall, and saying things like, “Nice ass.” Of course the women gave him what-for and complained about it, but nothing was done. (It was the 70s, after all.)

So, the nurses took matters into their own hands.

One day, they waited as he scrubbed in for surgery, opened the patient, and got to work. As soon as he was elbows-deep, one of the nurses went behind him and pantsed him.

It was below the sterile field, and his gown covered his man bits, so there was no risk to the patient. But the surgeon could not break sterility to pull up his own pants. He demanded that the nurses pull his pants up. They refused, and said, “Now you know what it’s like to be humiliated at work,” and, “Maybe now you’ll keep your hands to yourself.”

The surgeon had to finish the hours-long surgery with his pants and undies around his ankles, then shuffle away to scrub out. Yep, he could not pull his pants up in the OR theatre without contaminating himself, therefore he had to do the shuffle of shame. 

There was an immediate understanding after that. The surgeon stopped slapping asses and catcalling, and as a result, he didn’t get pantsed in surgery again. He may or may not have stopped objectifying women, but he certainly learned not to underestimate them. ;-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/dckbaw/1970sstyle_justice_sexually_harrass_a_bunch_of/,pettyrevenge,213,0.0

There was this one kid (SK) that everyone went to if they lost their stationary. Now I lost a pencil. Nothing much apart from the fact that it was a mechanical one that had cost me £10. A bit much I know but pretty good quality. With all my stuff, I mark them with a little drawing that signifies that it's mine though it's pretty hard to notice.

I noticed that it was missing in the maths lesson that SK oh so happened to bump into me and let my pencil case spill. I went to him after school and guess what? He had it! I told him it was mine and he told me it was his. I showed him the insignia. Still nothing. He was selling it for £5 but I only had about £3. In the end another kid bought it.

The next day I brought my wallet and asked the kid if I could buy it. He asked for £7. I now had payed £17 for a mechanical pencil! I wasn't very pleased. Not. At. All.

The next day he bumped into someone and I happened to be nearby. His pencils dropped everywhere and so did his calculator. I took it and decided to mess it up. I changed the contrast and made it practically illegible and, just for good measure, I changed it to Sci. In maths I gave it back to him saying I had seen it on the floor. He urned it on and thought it was off. He then realised what had happened and tried to roll with it. Then he got confused by the Sci. He couldn't even turn it back as he didn't know how to.

2019-09-26 01:25:45+00:00,7721,The school janitor wouldn’t let me throw up in the bathroom so I threw up on floor and watched him clean it up,SpicyHashbrowns,"Back in high school it was final exam week, I was very ill but I had to pull through the day. I threw up every hour on the hour. There was only one bathroom on each floor fo students, it sucked major ass because you usually had to walk far to go. I felt ok after puking for the millionth time but that soon faded after 20 minutes so I go sprinting for the bathroom. Everyone is in class or taking exams so the hall is free and clear.

Well the janitor decided this was the time to clean the bathrooms. While he’s cleaning one he locks the other bathroom for some reason, I tried to use the girls bathroom and he stood in the way. I told him I had to throw up and he said

“Do it somewhere else” and blocked the door. The boys restroom was locked so I leaned over the trash can attached to his cleaning cart. He yelled at me and shooed me away. I was pissed and couldn’t hold it anymore so I threw up on the floor 15 feet down the hallway. I probably dragged a good splash of vomit 10 feet down the hall.

The vice principle came out of the office as this was happening. She was actually my English teacher for years before she became vice principle, she took me to her office and cleaned me up. I told her what happened, she made him clean up my puke, I watched from the office and then she then fired him on the spot.

2019-09-25 09:38:24+00:00,3952,Annoying roommate back in college.,Tier1TechSupport,"Back in college when I lived in a dorm room, I got assigned one of the most annoying roommates ever. He would always be bragging about himself and how smart and strong he was.

Anyway, one day, there was a big earthquake (this was Southern California) and after the quake was over for a few hours, he shows up in our dorm room and starts telling me that he's as fast and nimble as a panther! (Not joking.) He said that if another big quake ever hits us again, he'd survive because (get this) he'd *jump* out of the window of our 7th story room and grab onto a tree that was growing outside about 20 feet away while the building crumbled to the ground with me in it. ""You know what I'd do? I'd jump out the window and grab onto that tree because I'm like a panther! I'm a panther, you see? And I can save myself because I can just grab on that tree.""

""Whatever,"" I tell him.

Anyway, it's getting late and we both turn in for the night. We share a bunk bed. I'm on the bottom and he's on the top. As if it to make it perfectly clear how panther-like he can be, he *leaps* into the top bunk with one mighty jump. An hour later, he starts snoring and it wakes me up! I get pissed off at him and I'm thinking to myself, ""This is my chance to get rid of him!""

So I grabbed the frame of the bunk bed and started shaking it was hard as I could! And you know what happened? That moron woke up and thought it was another big earthquake! And just like he said, he leaped out of bed (like a panther, I suppose) and, instead of jumping out the window like you'd think he would, he opens the door and runs out into the hallway. Before he gets very far, he hears me laughing like a hyena (if he can be a panther, I can be a hyena).

He comes back in and I ask him, ""Why didn't you jump out the window like you said you would?""

And he says, ""F---- you!"" And then he climbs back into bed and pretends nothing happened.

Idiot.

At least I had a good laugh at his expense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d90xjr/annoying_roommate_back_in_college/,pettyrevenge,101,0.0
2019-09-24 14:48:14+00:00,8292,"""Oh, but that's not a parking spot""",LongLiveMisanthrope,"I think this is the most petty I have ever been, and no need to ask if I was the asshole, cause I totally was. But it tickled me and a few others. This happened a few weeks back and still makes my friends I have made laugh about it.

I do deliveries around our town, and as such I need gas to do so. There is one gas station I hit up every morning before work because the gas is cheapest, it is on my route to work and it has a better selection of breakfast snacks and drinks than the others around it. Since I have been stopping off there a minimum of 3 times a week for the last 6 years I have gotten to know the owner and a few of the long time staff there. They are all good people and treat me nicer than normal employees do. So I try to treat them with as much respect as I possibly can.

One morning while I am filling up, one of the female employees (we'll call her Rachael for this story) was standing idly by one of the pumps. She has a few mental problems but is one of the nicest people I know. So while my gas is being filled, I strike up a conversation. She tells me she ain't doing so hot, because she is supposed to take out the trash from the outside bins and put it in the dumpster around the side of the building.

The way the building is designed, there is only one way to get to the dumpster to put anything in it, and that way is clearly marked with signs and paint saying, do not park here or block the dumpster. I look over and there is a caravan of about 5 minivans parked around the area. Most were in legit parking spaces, but the biggest one with a massive roof-rack was parked awkwardly in front of the dumpster, completely blocking it off.

I asked Rachael if she had asked them to move and she said they would move when they were done, and that was over 30 minutes ago. I feel for Rachael and her sad face at that time so I tell her I will make it up to her. After getting the nozzle put back up and got my car ready, I drove over to where the van was parked and parked my car in the first open parking spot behind it, effectively completely blocking it in. 

I get out of my car and walk about 5 steps away when a screeching Karen pokes her head out of the front window of the van. ""Hey! Can you move your car, I'm parked here!""

Me: ""Oh, but that's not a parking spot""

Her: ""Well, yeah, that's why I am trying to get out of it.""

Me: ""OK, but hold on. I'll just be a minute.""

I proceed to walk inside the store to get my morning meal, as I hear Karen screaming for me to come back. As the doors shut in the store, I noticed the place is over run with families buying travel snacks. They are all milling about but a few are looking out the window saying, ""I wonder what Karen is yelling about?"" They are clearly all in her caravan.

By the time I grab my food and drink and make it to the check out line, she has stormed her way in and is trying to tell me to move my car now. I tell her ""I can't leave, that would be stealing,"" so I am going to buy my stuff and leave. She huffs at this and notices everyone in front of her is a member of her traveling party, so she just glares at me the whole time.

I finally make it to the front after like ten minutes and go, ""Oh wait shoot this isn't what I wanted, I'll go put it back and grab what I really want."" Luckily I was still very early for getting to work so I was milking it for all it was worth. Karen is fuming. When I make it back to the line someone else is getting in line in front of me and Karen is trying to tell him to move so I can go first. The owner (we'll call Jess) tells her she isn't allowed to talk to customers that way and one more out burst from her and she will kick her out of the store. Karen mutters to her self but is silent. I go up to check out, moving and talking as slow as I can, and ask for a lottery ticket as well. After paying, since no one is behind me I scratch it off, what do you know, I won a free ticket. So I buy another one and proceed to scratch it off. Karen to that point had been mildly tolerable, but then she let out this unholy screech and told me to stop wasting her time. To which Jess told her to leave. Karen started to refuse and Jess picked up her phone threatening to call the cops. Karen is then swift to leave at this point, now yelling at her caravan as to why they have to wait.

I thank Jess for all of that she has done so far and explain what was going on, still really slowly. She laughs and tells me how much she hates people who park there, they get all defensive when you tell them that they can't park there, but this is the first time anyone got their comeuppance over it. I left and saw Rachael standing near my vehicle, doing her best not to laugh. I load up my car and asked if everything is better and she nods enthusiastically.

I move my car to the other side of the lot and watch them all leave one by one , but not before Karen pulled out in front of someone and almost wrecked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d8o8bd/oh_but_thats_not_a_parking_spot/,pettyrevenge,163,0.0

BUT there was this one Judge that was extremely flirtatious and he would ask us girls out for lunch all the time. He really liked me- I was curvy and blonde, must have been his type. He came in around 3pm one afternoon, kept trying to touch and grab me, really laying it on thick. I was embarrassed by his lewd comments and told him No repeatedly. My coworker rang him up so I could hide out in the backroom until he left. It was disgusting and humiliating.

That night my parents wanted to eat at Red Lobster about 3 miles from the store, so I met them at the restaurant after work. Being a Friday night, it was busy and I found my family outside the front doors waiting for our party to be called. Guess who was also waiting? yep- The Judge. There He sat with His Wife, he'd seen me and was trying not to make eye-contact. I told my Gramma what The Judge had done that day at my store and she was pissed! She took my arm and guided me to stand next to her RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE! At first I was embarrassed but then I realized how uncomfortable we were making him. BUT then My Gramma started a conversation with the Wife! It was glorious watching The Judge squirm and sweat!

2019-09-23 07:39:31+00:00,6346,"Math Teacher Forgets Object Permanence, and Retires.",MustbeeaWeasley,"Setting (USA): Me, Sixth Grade math class 

I was a painfully shy kid. I'm near-sighted, and most teachers noticed it. Being able to see the board = being engaged in learning. Teachers usually seated me in the front of the classroom, and I would do really well. Except for this math teacher. My last name is towards the bottom of the alphabet, and he would only seat us alphabetically. For context, later, he was an older teacher. I ended up in the back of his class. After struggling to see the board, being a non-confrontational child; I wrote him a note on my homework asking to move to the front. 

I got my homework back at the end of class with a big red underlined ""***NO! Assigned seats only.***"" written on it. I was devastated. I've never been in trouble, and didn't think that it was that hard to switch me around. This is where the revenge plays out.

I love to read. I always have. I always had books with me. After being frustrated by not being able to see the board, I quit trying. I would bring out whatever book I was currently reading and just read during class. Nothing was said at first.

One day, I was reading in class, and it just got ***quiet***. Like a sudden drop in temperature. It got quiet enough for me to look up. He was lingering next to me, and the whole class was staring. Again, I'm painfully shy. He held his hand out and shouted ""Book."" I handed it over, and when class was over he had me stand in the front of the class and say I was sorry for causing a disruption. I was too shy to talk, ended up getting an after school detention for ""defiance."" I was also late for my next class.

 I always carried my books separate from my binder so I could read while walking to class. The next day, he took my book right out of my hands while I was walking into class. I got it back and by the end of the day, I finished that book. The library had five copies of the next book in the series. I checked all of them out. The next day, like clockwork, I walked into class with my nose in the book, and he took it from me. Once class started, and he stopped staring at me, I pulled my next copy out. Eventually he saw it, and he stormed over to my desk. ""I didn't tell you that you can have this back. Don't take things off my desk."" He yelled. ""I didn't."" I replied. He turns around, sure enough, there was a book on his desk. And one in his hand. The whole class laughed. The laughter made him even angrier. He walked over to his desk and slammed the book down. 

I waited for him to stop staring before I pulled out copy #3. He sees it, and repeat. He takes the book out of my hands, the whole class laughs, and he slams it down on the desk. 

Copy #4 is where it got interesting. He sees it, storms over, ""GET UP.""  I grab my binder and stand next to my desk, where he opens it and doesn't see anything. He slams the top down and tells me to stand in the corner for the rest of the class. He adds book #4 to the pile, and goes back up front. What I didn't know, was that the teacher on the other side of the wall called the principal during book #3's incident and she was on her way down. 

I open my binder ever so slowly (it was zippered) and take out copy #5. Set my binder down, and start reading. He sees me. He is HELLA MAD now. He comes over, screaming at me for disrupting his class. He goes to open my desk, rips the top off of it. He throws my text book on the floor. He sees my binder, opens it, and dumps the contents on the floor. 

Right as the Principal is walking in the door.

She sees him, the papers, me in the corner, and the broken desk. ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" He was shocked. All he could muster was ""SHE HAS A BOOK!"" before grabbing me and taking the book out of my hands. She ran over to him, got me loose, and took the book from him. ""ARE YOU INSANE?!"" He stormed out of the classroom. The principal asked me to come to her office. She called my mom, and I got to go home early. 

We had a substitute teacher for a few weeks, before he announced he was retired ""unexpectedly."" 

And yes, I was then moved to the front of the class. I still hate math though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d83aaz/math_teacher_forgets_object_permanence_and_retires/,pettyrevenge,318,0.0
2019-09-22 18:47:57+00:00,3584,"Hey, Come Look at This!",Zeldaspellfactory,"About 25 years ago, my mother had to have an operation on her stomach. They kept her VERY doped up. One day, in this drugged state, she overheard to people outside her room talking about ""boring surgery on boring patients"". She thought they were talking about her. So she decided to NOT be boring. Her stomach was stapled shut, and the staples were not up against her skin at the very top.

She called me and asked for some very specific things. I thought she was going to mend someone's coat, or scrubs or something. She is amazing with a needle and thread, and it was not uncommon for her to want to fix something for you - and generally it was a very fast repair. NOPE.

I get there with the box of supplies (if she finds one person to mend for, others ALWAYS follow). I did wonder why she wanted a selection of my beads and fancy shaped buttons, but whatever. She grabs the box and starts lifting up her hospital gown.

She put beads and buttons on every single staple. I tried to stop her, but that wasn't possible. Rounds were shortly after she was done, and I had called my father to come down for them. It was too funny to exclude him. He showed up at the hospital just before the doctors got to her rooms.

As usual at that time, I had to go outside to wait, but my dad was in the room. A minute or two after the doctor's go in, I hear this LOUD laughter. Then one of the junior doctors runs out and calls every doctor in the hospital to :Come look at this! We are in Room XXX"" 

They laugh but then ask her why she sewed buttons and beads on her staples. She responded with ""I heard 2 people talking about boring patients with boring surgery. I didn't want to fall into that category, so I made it all pretty for you.""

Two junior doctors got super quiet when she said this. They were not referring to her, but having even one patient hear them was uncalled for. They got taken outside to a lounge and they got chewed out. We couldn't hear what they were saying, but we heard yelling from a room I know was the staff lounge.

My mom was asked to keep the buttons and beads in her staples until the next day. Then after a steady parade of people asking to see her work, her doctor made her take them out. Every doctor who came in was laughing.

2019-09-22 01:05:10+00:00,6610,You bullied me? What was your name?,Lemonslothcake,"There was a guy I used to like in school. He was in the year below and one day I gave him a letter saying I liked him and wanted to get to know him better.

This guy then spread that letter around the whole school so for a good year or so he and his friends made fun of me. He wasn’t someone that people generally crushed on, but he used the letter as a way to get some attention on himself. Even long after people lost interest he would try bringing it up and reignite the teasing.

I’m 23 now, and that was a distant memory. But that didn’t stop my heart rate elevating and palms sweating when I suddenly saw him in a cafe. 

I ordered my drink and then waited, hoping he wouldn’t recognise me. Worst nightmare. He walks over and says hello. 

“It’s me, [name], That guy from school”. I turn and stare at him before saying “sorry, I don’t think I know you.” To which he replied, “yeah, you wrote me a letter saying you liked me.” 

I put on a face of thinking long and hard before saying, “wait...from 10 years ago? I remember a letter...but to be honest I don’t remember you at all. I guess you didn’t have that much of an impact on me...”

My drink was ready so I grab it. And he says “but you wrote me the letter. You gave it to me”. 

I stop and say with a thoughtful expression, “I’m remember Dave, Blake. Matt and Tim...but I’m sorry, I just don’t remember you...”

He suddenly looks embarrassed and then mumbled something as I said goodbye and walked out. 

It felt good not letting me knock me down this one last time. 

TL;DR I liked a guy who then bullied me for years about it. Now as an adult he approached me and tried reminding me about the fact I liked him, I instead tell him I couldn’t remember who he was and that he clearly hadn’t made any sort of impact on my life if I’d forgotten who he was.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d7jltg/you_bullied_me_what_was_your_name/,pettyrevenge,314,0.0

2019-09-20 22:26:48+00:00,6116,Revenge for an overbearing sister on her 3rd wedding day,Jenny8765309,"  

Hi everyone. 

I’m a long-time lurker, first time poster.

This story started years ago….as in – the day I was born.

Cast;

Me – me (duh)

BS (Big sister. Or B-tch sister)

M - mom

See, BS was the “baby” of the family before I was born. I came along just weeks before she turned 9 years old, and almost every day since then it has been a competition between us. 

Some examples;

When I was in 7th grade science, I aced science class. On a major test, I was able to name all the major muscles in the body. At that time, BS was a nursing student. M asked me not to flaunt my success because my sister was “sad” over not doing as well.

Almost every shirt, pair of jeans, etc… I bought, with my own money, ended up on her side of the closet because she “liked it.”

M clearly favors BS, although she will deny it.

Step into the time machine to 20 years ago, when my husband and I got married. M wanted every detail of my wedding to be just like BS’s. The invitations had to look like hers, the colors of the bridal party had to look the same, the first dance had to be the same song. After decades of living in BS’s shadow, I finally put my foot down and threatened to elope rather than have a church wedding. M is very religious, so that was my trump card. 

M caved, and I was able to get what I wanted. Finally.

BS was the matron of honor, not by my choice but because M didn’t want my BFF from high school, someone I had been almost a real sister to for over a decade, to take the place of a blood sibling.

During the ceremony, BS did the first reading. This was about ten minutes after I walked down the aisle and was sitting at the alter with my hubby.

My jaw dropped when BS announced, before the bible verse, “This is one of the best days of my life. I’m so proud to see my baby sister finally get married, (I was 25) but this morning I found out I’m pregnant.”

There was a scattering of slow but polite applause on my hubby’s side, and M almost ran to the podium to embrace BS. Even on my side of the church, with my other siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, friends, etc... was quiet. Dad was happy but looked angry. 

(Funny story…on the video of the wedding, which we watched later, you could clearly hear me say to hubby “are you f-cking kidding me?”)

The rest of the ceremony BS cradled her flat tummy, and when communion time rolled around the bride, me, got the first host and sip of wine. Thanks to college and my Irish side of the family, I drank the gauntlet in three sips.

Time ticked on, and BS never started to show. When M asked her about it, BS said she “must have misread the test” because she got her period two days later. Keep in mind that BS is a nurse and it would have been her 3rd pregnancy. She brushed it off and shrugged her shoulders when a family member said it wasn’t the time to make the announcement. Her husband moved out of the house because of the drama, along with their two toddlers. The divorce soon followed.

Last summer, BS got remarried. It was a her 3rd marriage, and even though dad had since passed away, BS wanted the entire dramatic walk down the aisle.

She wanted me to be matron of honor. She was VERY specific about the details of how I would look. I refused to have my mid-back length hair cut into a bob. I hit the gym for hours almost day and was able to fit into the backless dress in a size I hadn’t been since high school. It took months, but after 20 years and 4 kids of my own, it was an uphill battle. 

At the last fitting for my dress she took a close look at my skin, and demanded that I take care of my dry skin so I would look perfect. 

The day of the ceremony came along, and I was the only member of the bridal party to walk down…our other sister was in the first 2, and wanted to sit out number 3.

My hair was in a beautiful up-do, showing off my back, from the base of my skull to just above my butt. It was a chilly day, so I kept my coat on until right before I walked. 

\#3’s side of the church was mostly silent, and there were a few chuckles on BS/our side, but M let out a gasp when she saw my new tattoos – which completely covered my back  - every inch that the dress didn’t cover – and my new tatted “sleeves.”

She was furious and shot me angry looks throughout the ceremony.

The tattoos, all henna, washed off within a few days.

There is a guy at our school that is... a dickhead. Let's refer to him as D. D is pretty buff and he thinks that makes him 'irresistible' to girls and superior to other guys. Therefore he is known for messing with people, especially with girls, and he is generally the archetype of a bully. Anyways, he did a double-dick-move that day. He stood near two of my friends, one of which was a guy and another a girl. She was on her phone and had her back to D. He slapped her bottom and immediately turned around to face my other friend, and pretended as if he was the offender. Everyone nearby suddenly stopped doing what they were doing and started staring at the ordeal. She reddened and became very upset and ran away, not even letting my other friend make his excuse. We were both shocked, and D had a very fucking annoying smug look on his face. 

Next day, my friend found her and told her about the situation, and luckily she listened. She still decided not to tell an adult about what happened, probably because of shame. I was very pissed that I couldn't do anything the day before, and wanted to do something nasty.

Here is when the revenge part comes in.

While we were still in the school, I sent one of those 'STD Anonymous Notification' messages from [stdcheck.com](https://stdcheck.com). I knew that it was going to be his weak point. When D saw the message, I saw him storm out of the class and rush in the direction of the bathroom. I later learned that he vomited for 10 minutes straight. The fucker probably saw his life flash before his eyes.

He didn't come to school for a week. 

Needless to say, he went back to normal in a couple of days or so, but he started being less of a dick towards everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d6jy1m/messing_around_with_my_friends_go_get_checked_for/,pettyrevenge,189,0.0
2019-09-19 03:56:27+00:00,3178,Collapse my tent? Prepare to be trapped in yours for hours.,wiltedtree,"This story starts many years ago when I was a Boy Scout. In our troop, we had a kid that was a total bully, especially to the less socially skilled among us. He would steal and hide your things, lock people in outhouses, that sort of thing. At no point did the adults ever take notice of what was going on.

On one particular trip, he brought a french exchange student that his family was hosting, and the two of them got into the habit of dragging everything out of tents and collapsing them. It got to the point where you couldn't be gone from camp for more than half an hour without risking a ton of work putting your campsite back together. To make things worse, this kid was a tad unstable and made it known that if anyone retaliated he would do everything he could to find them and ""beat the shit"" out of them. Between the frustration of repeatedly pulling expensive camp gear out of the dirt and the threats of violence, this quickly moved from the realm of boyish pranks to a real problem for everyone.

Luckily for me, I followed the Boy Scout motto of ""be prepared"" and had brought a spool of safety wire and a bag full of zip ties. The night before we were supposed to leave, I snuck out when everyone was asleep and wrapped his tent zippers in several nested layers of zip ties and wire. The zip ties kept the zippers too closed to use wire cutters from the inside, and the wire prevented him from cutting the zip ties with a knife. I then dropped the tent on them and ran off as they hilariously tried in vain to get out of the tent. They ended up stuck under the tent for around six hours before an adult woke up and freed them from their predicament.

Now, to be clear, this isn't meant to be some story about a fight. However, true to his word, this kid found out it was me and ambushed me at the water spigot the next morning. Not wanting to get in trouble at home for fighting, I fought back a bit but mostly just dodged his punches. They gradually grew wilder and more uncontrolled in his desperation to show everyone watching that he was not to be messed with. This came to a head when I dodged a big haymaker just in time for it to go full speed into the trunk of an oak tree with a high yelp of pain.

     Her argument was that our bodies are strong enough to fight off ANY illness as long as we kept our immune systems strong (and vaccines weakened our immune system I guess?? she’s kinda dumb). 

      I didn’t really care that much until she said that my father wouldn’t have died from lung cancer if he hadn’t have gotten vaccinated or gone through any of the treatments. She said he passed because all the medicine “weakened his immune system too much.”

       Then I felt a sneeze come on and, being the petty bitch I am, I sneezed directly into her salad.

       She looked so genuinely disgusted and I just smiled at her and said  “don’t worry, it’ll strengthen your immune system.” I know it’s kind of stupid but it felt really good to say.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d5p31o/some_petty_revenge_on_my_antivax_aunt/,pettyrevenge,54,0.0

Two of my cousins (they were brother and sister) were always particularly mean to me. One day, my girl cousin and I got into an argument (i dont even remember what it was about) and she tore up the drawing i was working on. I was enraged and slapped her. Cousin went crying to her mommy and told her I had hit her. I tried to explain that she had torn my drawing to peices, even showed it to her but nobody would listen to me. 


I was forced to apologise to her. 


Now, my aunt's house had a common play area for the kids, where they kept all their toys. The visiting kids' toys were also kept there. My cousin and her brother had several  jigsaw puzzles that they loved to show off, but never let anyone touch. 



So that night, I lay awake in my bed till i was sure that everyone had fallen asleep, and then snuck into the play area. I quietly opened up each box of puzzles and took out just one peice from each of them. I put everything back exactly the way it was, hid the puzzle peices in my bag and went to sleep. 


The next day, I buried the puzzle peices in the woods behind the house, so no one could find them. 

My crime wasn't discovered while we were there, because said cousin and her family left prematurely for some reason. However, about a week later, when we were back in our house, I heard my grandmother talking to cousin's mom on the phone and then telling my dad about her conversation. Apparently, my cousins had been throwing temper tantrums because they were unable to solve their jigsaw puzzles.

I would use my leftovers to meal prep for the week, and told him to stop as it was expensive as well as inconvenient. The behavior did not stop and he actually seemed to be eating more of my food out of spite. To punish him, I baked a chocolate cake with habanero peppers and mixed the frosting with wasabi. I labled it with my name and a bold ""Do Not Eat"" and waited. This guy has a very low tolerance for spicy foods so I thought he would take one bite quickly realize the error of his ways. About two days later, him and a couple of his friends got really drunk while I was at work and decided to dig into my food. Somehow, they ate about a third of it before realizing, and when they inevitable went to throw up from over drinking and eating spicy foods, got hit by the cake a 2nd time.

2019-09-14 19:03:41+00:00,2802,Social Experiment With Satisfying End,Born2hope,"Ok folks, picture it: there I was, waiting at a stop light to turn green so I could cross traffic and merge onto the interstate. Two turn lanes and I happened to be in my less favorite because of a sort of odd (in my opinion) merging process once on the highway. But oh well can't always get what you want. For background info the two lanes merge at different times once connected to the interstate so you have to merge two times if in the right side lane. So what is I believe 5 lanes becomes 4 then 3, at intervals of about 1000yds? I find that inefficient so I prefer the left lane. But whatever, as long as ya get there. 

The light turns green and we go through the intersection, across to the two lane access ramp where my lane ends almost as soon as we connect with the highway. I am blocked from merging by a lady in an SUV so I speed up, hey we are joining highway speeds anyway, better be near the speed of the other traffic. She speeds up and I can see her glancing my direction... Which why would she do if she wasn't being malicious and intentionally preventing me from going ahead of her. She should have no reason to look in my direction on her right.

Well it's a bit annoying but whatever, I brake, go behind her and then merge to the lane just left of her. This was as far as I could go because of other traffic in the next lane. Honestly would have preferred to get further over and give other cars space for merging and to get away from an obvious turd of a driver but again, you don't always get what you want.

Then I see her lane is about to end and she has to now merge to where I am.... And a very curious thought comes to me. I wonder what she will do if I treat her the same way she just treated me? So as she speeds up, so do I. I match her speed until the lane is almost ending and then I glanced over and see her and presumably a teenage daughter both yelling at me and gesturing wildly. Absolutely outraged that I would dare not let them merge. And guess what happened? She had to slow down and go behind and around me. Like I had just had been forced to do.

Human nature is so interesting. She literally had just done the exact same thing to me and I didn't make a big deal about it. But how funny that she was so angry when she got her comeuppance. What I had was a nice little drive with a happy little smile all the way. So petty.

2019-09-12 16:27:33+00:00,3619,Take my food? Suffer.,Dead_as_a_doorknob,"I'm a junior in highschool. Female, if that matters. 

After second period, we have something called flight time. This is basically home room. You do your work, eat a snack if you want, watch videos, talk to your friends, whatever you want really. I also bring the same thing. A baggy of thinly sliced sausage, Ritz crackers and cheese. Like really nice, expensive cheese. I make these into little sandwiches and this holds me over until lunch, because I have the last lunch of my school. It's starts at 1:30, so you can tell why I would be ravenous by then. 

There are two girls I've known since 8th grade in flight time. One of them, C, is one of my best friends. The other one, A, is full of drama popular girl. She's always been like this, since middle school. 

These two girls sit right next to me, C on my left and A on my right. For the past week or two, I've been preparing my snack and eating it as soon as I sit down. C politely asks for a cracker and slice of meat and I say yes. A has gotten into the habit of taking fistfuls of my food, after she asked for a cracker and I said yes the first day. She just assumes she can take my food every day because she asked once and I said yes. It's gotten to the point where she will take the rest of the bag after I've made a little sandwich or two. Taking all my crackers, meat AND cheese. 

It pisses me off, respectfully. But I knew I couldn't just say no and take it away, because she'll take it as a personal offense and go full queen bee. Instead, I decided to teach her a lesson.

I usually bring mild/sweet sausage. Italian. It's a nice, sweet meaty flavor that I adore. Apparently A thinks the same. So yesterday night, I decided to switch it up. Cajun andouille sausage is smoked and stuffed with spices such as cayenne, garlic, paprika and thyme. A much different flavor then the normal sweet meat I use. As you can tell, this is the meat I chose to bring. I also soaked the slices in jalapenos juice, because I think it taste better. 

I brought it all in and started preparing my food. A walks in and immediately zeros in on my food, shoving her hand into my baggy as soon as she got close. She grabbed a handful of slices and shoved them into her mouth like a starving piggy. Just what I knew she was going to do. 

Did I mention? A DESPISES spicy food. She's the type of girl who thinks bell peppers are too hot. So when her mouth was filled to the brim with this hot, spicy meat, her eyes started to water and her cheeks started to turn red. She ran across the room and threw it all up, tears streaming down her face. (Like I said, it wasn't even that hot. It's just jalapeno juice and spices) She ended up calling her mom and going home. 

She hasn't touched my food again, doesn't even look at me when she walks in the room. (:",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d3adzh/take_my_food_suffer/,pettyrevenge,144,0.0

I went to college in a very small town about 45 minutes away from any decent size city. My junior year a buddy and myself rented a house together. When we were setting up utilities we ended up getting a triple play package from the incumbent cable company which included TV, High Speed internet, and a phone. This was 2014 so phones had already been on their way out but there was no savings not to get it. Almost immediately after install we started getting a lot of late night calls for a new restaurant called ""Not Franks Pizza"". 

This restaurant had just opened and wanted to play off the local reputation of a restaurant called ""Franks Pizza"" of course. Knowing this was dirty I wasn't exactly a fan of their business practices (but they did have good food). 

Come to find out our new phone number had the last 2 digits transposed of their number. Wanting to seize the moment and get back at them for their crappy business name we decided to start accepting orders for the place.

We ended up giving outrageous totals and telling customer their orders would be delivered in a few hours.  After a few weeks the error in dialing seemed to stop and I think people picked up on what was going on. However shortly after that, the business changed its' name and got a new phone number but kept the same owner.

Looking back it was a d*ck move but at the same time, trying to steal someone elses notoriety is just as bad. 

Unfortunately a year after I graduated the college moved to a bigger city and the town just about died. I believe the place is still in business but mainly because of their bar for the locals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d2yedo/ride_on_someone_elses_name_pay_the_price/,pettyrevenge,66,0.0

  Up ahead there were workers fixing the road and a bunch of flashing light and arrows signifying the lane was closed. Everyone had to merge on the left lane right before the next traffic light. 
  Now everyone in front of me one by one merged into the left lane in a you go i go rotation with the cars already in that lane. UNTIL it got to be my turn. The car in front of me merged left. It was now the person next to me turn to drive forward as i merged behind him. However the guy behind him kept inching up onto Ilona bumper making it impossible for me to merge. 
  He knew what he was doing, his lack of common decency was outstanding. So i sped up in my lane and was able to get in front of the guy who was initially next to me. Then the line kept moving getting ever closer to the merger. Then it happened the guy who was now behind me made a left turn. And me bumper bumper was no directly behind me. When I saw that i hit me brakes and proceeded to let the next 5- cars from the right lanes merge in front of me. This is bumper to bumper traffic so where talking an easel 10 minutes thrown on top of commute time. He knew he had been defeated.

2019-09-06 21:37:27+00:00,4203,Act rude to me during an anxiety attack? Enjoy your trip ending horribly.,IntricaciesOfLife,"I was recently on vacation in Israel on a trip with a bunch of other people. It’s essentially program where a bunch of people with Jewish heritage come together and enjoy a free trip for 10 days. 

I was having a great time, and most people in my group were pretty sweet, with the exception of a few assholes. 

Miss Asshole was the queen of all the assholes on the trip. She was your typical mean girl, I’m better than everyone, come look at me. Fuck your body, yeah you look overweight, yeah you need to do squats, your hair is frizzy, I know ten people on the Bachelorette, I’m practically Miss America headass. 

We were exploring a deserted area in a poor neighborhood, and we came across a train station that was abandoned. There were reports of violence there, so it’s a wonder our group leaders let us stay, but we did anyway. Everyone was on edge, especially me. 

I have several anxiety disorders (OCD, Generalized Anxiety, etc) and I was already pretty nervous. 

Fast forward to us having to leave the place. We decide to take an elevator, which was __horrific__ looking. It looked like it was made out of cardboard. We got in, and it was shaky and already uncomfortable. I couldn’t wait to get out. 

Of course, the elevator got stuck. A few over dramatic people began to scream, and I felt my anxiety begin to rise. 

Instead of screaming and making a scene, I did the breaths my therapist told me about and tried to relax. 

That’s when Miss Asshole opens her mouth to me. “Um, calm the fuck down.” 

I was shocked. People were screaming, but I WAS THE ONE who needed to calm down? 

I explained to her that I had anxiety and that I was just doing breathing exercises. 

To which she replied, “but you’re making everyone else nervous!! calm the fuck down, you’re so annoying.” 

At this point I was fed up. I loudly told her that it was literally involuntary, and that she could shut her damn mouth. 

Afterword, a bunch of people spoke to me and comforted me and took my side. Miss Asshole was already enraged by this, but the best part of the story happened that evening. 


Since it was the last day of the trip, our group leaders had prepared a final activity for us, where we choose a person that impacted us and pass a ball of yarn to them. they hold onto a piece of the string, and it makes a dream catcher connecting all of us. 

My group leader decided to go first. He spoke about an amazing girl who impacted the entire group, how she had made an impact on everyone, especially him. He had tears in his eyes, and I soon realized he was referring to me. He then called my name, handed me the string and I was in tears. 

I made a speech and spoke about everyone who impacted me too. I was the star of the show, and Miss Asshole was seething. It was truly satisfying. 

But the best part happened when every single person had gone, and there was only one person left who didn’t get mentioned..... 

Miss Asshole. 

Not only that, but there was no string left on the container, so someone tossed the empty thing to her. They had no choice but to “pick her” because she was the last person left.

 She tried to play it off by fake laughing, but you can tell the whole thing fucked up her evening. 

Enjoy being the least popular person in the group, Miss Asshole. 

TLDR; Girl on my trip tries to roast me while I’m suffering from an anxiety attack and not bothering anyone. I roast her back and get comforted and validated by all. Later on, she’s the last out of everyone to get chosen for a goodbye celebration, while I practically get a standing ovation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/d0n0mq/act_rude_to_me_during_an_anxiety_attack_enjoy/,pettyrevenge,134,0.0

One of them, Susan, is a distinctly unpleasant person to be around and to work with. I sit two desks away from her. I've been there for almost two years, and in that time, this 59 year old woman has always treated me with disrespect. (I'm 26.) Some of our coworkers say that she's just a product of her time, when older people routinely look down on younger people, but I call major BS on that. Anyway. Our office is also physically narrow and I am not a small woman. I'm 5'9"" or so. I'm not skinny, so my butt is a little big, and my hips are wide. After over a year of her disrespect, I decided to fight back. 

I made use of my wide hips and big butt. I hip check her chair every time I walk past her. (She is ALWAYS sticking her chair over the entire aisle, even when there's another person sitting behind her. We've repeatedly asked her to not do that, but she does anyway.) One day, I heard her say ""She did that on purpose!"" I thought that at least she was beginning to get the message. I kept hip checking her chair. 

More recently, I was standing behind my chair getting ready to leave after a long day, and I was blocking the walkway. It was mostly deserted in the office, and the only people there were in another room, so I stood behind my chair and did my thing. Susan comes up to my left (and I'm standing between her and the exit). She stands there for two full minutes at least, not bothering to ask my to move. Our floor manager, Lawrence, comes up next to her. 

Susan: Lawrence, I can't get through!

Before he had a chance to say anything, I raised my voice, but did not yell. 

Me: You know Susan, there is such a phrase as 'excuse me please'. If you'd use it, I would be more than happy to let you by. 

It was that moment when our boss's boss, Alex, comes up, not having heard a word. 

Alex: Excuse me. Pardon me. 

I smile at him at let him pass, then I blocked Susan from leaving for about 60 more seconds. It was satisfying when Lawrence was laughing and she was fuming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/czc0td/the_phrase_is_excuse_me_please/,pettyrevenge,92,0.0

2019-08-31 08:22:47+00:00,2555,Got really angry on someone else's behalf and took action.,friccadyfrac,"This happened a couple of years ago. I was in a shop, waiting in a line of maybe 5 people before me, just to pick up a cold drink on my way home from work. I saw a little, old lady, coming up to stand behind me in line, with a cart full of items. Back when I was a kid, my dad told me how I should try to remember to be kind to elderly people and smile at them, especially if they're alone and I've made a habit out of this. I often get the feeling that I brighten someone's day by doing this and that brings me joy as well.  


Anyway, I smiled at this lady and made some idle chit chat that I've long forgotten, before turning back to face the front of the queue. This lady was staying a couple of feet behind me, probably because she didn't want to accidentally hit me with her cart. The line moved forwards and I glance back again, surprised to see that behind me is now a dude, roughly around my age, in between me and the lady with the cart, whose smile is now gone. I was standing right there, so I know that not a single word was uttered between them. He'd just seen the space in between us and stepped into the spot, probably assuming (and correctly so) that she wasn't about to do or say anything about it.  


I would say that this lady was probably in her 80's or so and seemingly using the cart a bit for support, whereas this guy was fairly pumped up, but I'd say about half a foot shorter than me. I'm not the kind of guy who feels a need to assert himself physically or to look for trouble. I'm 6'6"" and a fairly broad shouldered guy, so I suppose I've just not very often felt a need to. There's no doubt this guy spent more time in the gym than I do, but for some reason I could instantly feel my blood boiling over this situation and without really thinking about it, I uttered ""So, are you going to move to the back or the line, or will I have to do it for you?""  


He looked like he wanted to kill me, made a little grunt, didn't say a word, but bent down to pick up his basket of things, to walk to the back of the line. The little old lady didn't say a word either, but smiled at me, about the widest smile I've seen. It wasn't the prettiest smile I've seen, but it definitely made me feel like I did exactly what I was supposed to do.

He hired me to essentially run large aspects of our program, and gave me pretty much unilateral oversight of the key elements of it, from program design and development, to execution. He was a great manager in this respect. He provided a lot of mentoring and guidance, but mostly got out of my way, and only wanted me to escalate the big stuff that I felt rose to the level. While I didn't love the job itself, I loved having so much freedom. I was sort of bridging that gap of moving from a young professional into a mid-career professional, and so this offered a lot of growth opportunities. One thing that made my boss great was that he always had my back. 

One day, I was in the office pretty much alone. My boss was on the board of a few orgs, and he was off at a half-day meeting. Our offices were right across from each other, so I could typically see him when he came and left, and I could hear his phone when it rang. That morning, his phone was ringing, and ringing, and ringing. Then finally, my phone rang. It was the ED of one of the organizations we worked with, an older man, maybe in his 70s. The conversation went something like this:

**Me:** Ouroborus13 speaking, how can I help you? 

**ED:** (Sounding frustrated). I've been calling Charles all morning but he's not answering.

**Me:** Yes, he's at a half day Board meeting. Is there something I can help you with? 

**ED:** I doubt it. Maybe you could just check his calendar and put a call with me on there for when he's back. 

**Me:** I'm sorry, I wish I could but I don't have access to his calendar, so I can't see what he has in the afternoon and I can't add things to his calendar. I'm sure he'll be back soon....

**ED:** (Cuts me off). That's unacceptable! How does his secretary not to have access to his calendar?! Who sets his meetings?!

Now here's the thing. While I am my boss' employee, I am not his secretary. I don't have access to his calendar, and my boss sets his own meetings. Not only that, but I had corresponded with, and even met, this ED in the past. My signature block and business card clearly say ""Program Manager"", as does my bio on our web page. Alas, this wasn't the first time someone had assumed that I was my boss' secretary. It happens. I was in my late twenties at the time, and as a young professional woman working for a man, it seemed a common misconception. Usually, it's not a big deal. Normally, I clarify my role and people feel a little embarrassed, and we go on about our lives. So, I clarified my role for the ED. 

**Me:** Just to clarify, I'm not Charles' secretary. He doesn't have a secretary. I'm actually the Program Manager. Charles manages his schedule on his own. If you want to shoot us both an email, I'll make sure that he responds and sets up a time to talk to you. Otherwise, when he comes back I'll let him know you called so you can arrange a meeting....

**ED:** (Cuts me off again). Well, I have an important question for him, and it's unacceptable that I can't set up a meeting with him, and I also can't get an answer to it right away! How is this good client service?! 

**Me:** Well, you know, I am the Program Manager. Why don't you tell me what your question is about, and let's see if I can help you. 

The ED explained that he called to talk about the application process and requirements for a program of ours, one that I actually ran. Not only that, but the nature of his questions were not so complicated that it necessitated escalating to my boss. These were things I could easily help him with. 

**Me:** Well, you're in luck! I am actually the one who runs that program, not Charles. I've designed that application process, and I would actually be able to answer your questions with a lot more detail than Charles would. He would just defer you to me. Why don't you tell me what questions you have, and I can answer them! 

**ED:** (Long pause. Then, in a patronizing tone). Young lady, I'm sure you're very bright, and I'm sure you want to be helpful, but I'd really prefer to talk to Charles. Why don't you just take a message for him for me, okay?

Now I'm kinda pissed. I'm about to tell him where he can shove his message when I see my boss coming down the hallway. So, I tell the ED that he's in luck, I see Charles now! Let me go tell him you're on the line and get back to you. So, I put the ED on hold and intercept my boss. I kinda explain the situation. My boss chuckles to himself and says, ""Transfer him over.""

I transfer the call and I can hear my boss pick up the phone.

**Charles:** Chuck speaking... Oh hi there, ED, how can I help you...? Yes... Uh-huh... Yes I was at a half day Board Meeting.............. You have a question about which program....? Okay, what's your question.... Uh-huh, you want to know about the application process and criteria..... Uh-huh.... Okay, well have you spoken to my Program Manager Ouroborus13.......? Well, she's actually the one who manages that program....... Yes, she actually designed the application process.......... Sorry, ED, I wouldn't be able to answer that specific question....... No, I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to that....... Yes, that's right, Ouroborus13 manages that entire program, and she's really the expert on it........ Let me go see if she's in her office.

I hear my boss put the phone on hold. He takes a long pause before he gets back on. 

**Charles:** I'm sorry, ED, but it appears she must have stepped away from her desk. Why don't you send her an email and I'm sure she'll get back to you......... No, again I'm sorry, but she's really leading on that program, you'll have to speak with her. I could transfer you to her voicemail if you wish......? No, okay. Do you have her email....? Great, so send her an email and I'm sure she will get back to you on all your questions ASAP.

The ED didn't email me for a couple days, and when he finally did I helpfully walked him through all the details of the program he was interested in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cxhtr1/treat_me_like_my_boss_secretary_lets_see_how_that/,pettyrevenge,180,0.0

This happen a long time ago, I was making a bus travel and behind me there was this group of 4 guys that keep talking really loud, laughing and making jokes since we get on the bus. Nobody really were annoyed because it was day (afternoon , around 4 o´clock).

It was around 10 pm and the guys were still loud, people now were troubled by the noise and a nice lady sitting next to me (in the seat right in front of their) ask if they could keep it down because there was people who was trying to sleep. They just  start to shout and scold her. She looked at then terrified and returned to her seat in silence. One hour late, the bus stopped for a break of 30 min, everybody went grab something to eat or use the bathroom. After 30 min there was a call in the speakers warning all the passenger to return to the bus because it was leaving. After everybody entered and proceed to their seats there was a huge silence. The 4 assholes didn't boarded the bus.

The bus start moving toward the road when the nice lady that asked for the assholes to keep the volume down, look at their seats and noticed the four were missing. She said to me ""they are at the stop"", I just smiled, and said ""yes"". She asked if I was going to warn the driver. I Said ""no"". Everybody on the bus was smiling quietly, when the bus stopped just a few meters before enter the road, doors open and there came the scumbags, breathless and sweating because the ran about 200 meters waving for the driver to stop.

They proceed to their seats and no single word was listen from then the next 6 hours until we arrive at our destination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cx31et/assholes_in_the_bus_lets_forget_then_next_stop/,pettyrevenge,78,0.0

One thing I noticed and hated was that if I left a drink unattended for just a little bit, someone would steal it but it wouldn't just happen to me. If a guest left their drink on the bar or table unattended, it would disappear into someone else's stomach. 

I decided to mess with these thieves so I started to pour shots of soy sauce and leave them around my bar and just like other drinks, they would disappear. Most people didn't say anything or even react when they drank the soy sauce and I think it might be because they were too drunk, others would run away with the drink so I couldn't see but there were a few that came to me when they saw me laughing at them and said that they deserved it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cwm0jq/free_drinks/,pettyrevenge,156,0.0

2019-08-27 20:11:48+00:00,4297,Library Fine,GoW20000,"Years ago I worked at a library in NYC. There was one day a patron comes in. He's wearing a fresh Armani suit, and a pair of Ray Bans on his head. He has his Mercedes parked outside. He returns a book and it winds up being a day late. The late penalty was 25 cents. He starts fighting me about how I'm wrong and I should waive his fine. I refused and fought him back on the issue. He showed me his receipt and it showed that it was a day late. He then starts saying our computer system is wrong. I eventually said to him ""dude its only a quarter, you don't even have to pay it, you can let it sit there for the rest of your life"" he then lashes out and goes ""NO! Its not about the money! Its about the principle. I was not late"".

So my manager eventually comes and makes me look like a complete assholes. She goes ""So sorry sir, let me waive that for you"". He then looks at me and insults the clothes I am wearing, and calls me a peasant. I responded by calling him a ""bald headed prick"". He then threatens to sue the library. My manager tells me to go outside and get some fresh air. The balded headed prick then goes to look for another book.

When I go outside I noticed hes illegally parked. I also see a traffic cop handing tickets out. I called the traffic cop over and he writes out the ticket and leaves it under his windshield wiper. The guy comes out, see's the ticket and starts flipping out. I yelled out at him and said ""Good luck getting that waived, peasant"".

2019-08-26 01:19:25+00:00,3285,Getting a co-worker to humiliate himself,CroatianMexican,"The only thing Croatian about me is my last name. I don't speak Croatian; my old man was a 3rd generation American and didn't speak any either. We always had steak and fries like any normal red-blooded American. I'm half Spanish/French-descended Mexican and I speak Spanish fluently, having lived in Mexico City and Tijuana.

Anyhow, that day, I was working as a new marketing manager at an engineering firm in San Diego, working mostly on proposals. It consisted of coordinating between different engineers, ensuring compliance with RFPs, maintaining formatting consistency, and so forth. There were no standards in place, so I designed a few templates, programmed macros, and hot-key commands to expedite the formatting part. What usually took an hour now took a few minutes.

The Croatian informed me of an upcoming proposal and gave me three hours to do the formatting. I continued working on the previous project in the first hour since his stuff would take less than ten minutes. He came back to my office and looked at the computer screen to see that I wasn't working on his proposal. He threw a shit fit, screamed at me, told me I would be directly responsible if we lost money, and he had the audacity to e-mail everybody in the office not to distract me because I was supposed to be working on his stuff.

His stuff took only ten minutes and he was shocked. I didn't need an hour or two as he initially thought.

The incident solidified my resolve to make his life a living hell.

The Croatian came from what used to be Yugoslavia until a civil war erupted in 1991. Like the other Croatians, he lost everything except his charming personality and his two doctorate degrees from a university in Yugoslavia that was prominently displayed on his wall. Not only that, he took great offense to people calling him Mister instead of Doctor. While handing over the two doctorate degrees to be scanned, he implored me to be extremely careful as obtaining copies were not possible from this university.

He didn't know I had just gotten a color laser printer for my marketing stuff. It was expensive back then and I was the first to get it. I scanned both doctorate degrees and printed both in the color laser printer. Both looked exactly like the originals that were safely on desk while I put the two copies between the wheels of my chair and the plush carpet, repeatedly scooched back and forth on my chair to create a noticeable crease, and went back to his office with the two creased copies. He wasn't in his office, so I left the copies on his chair.

Not more than five minutes later, a very audible Croatian-accented, ""I'll kill him,"" came from the hallway. I swear he counted like Count Dracula with his thick Slavic accent! Then came the angry pitter-patter of his feet rapidly marching towards my office. I placed the two originals on my desk right when he barged in, causing my door to bang on the wall. His eyes darted over to my desk where the two perfectly intact originals were.

Innocently, I asked, ""I left the two copies of your degrees on your desk to see if you were satisfied with the quality before I put the image in the proposal.""

The commotion he created had my boss coming in ten second later, screaming from the bottom of his lungs, ""What the HELL is going on!?""

I shrugged, ""You have to ask him.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cvh9dd/getting_a_coworker_to_humiliate_himself/,pettyrevenge,88,0.0

2019-08-23 00:36:02+00:00,6250,Kicked out of first class bus seats in Brazil,a-dizzle-dizzle,"I'm American but lived in Brazil for 4 years. My husband is from São Paulo but we lived in Rio. We had spent a long weekend in SP. I was heading back to Rio alone on the bus since I had to get back to work (about a 6 hour trip on a big comfy coach bus with movies and stuff, not bad at all) and he was going to spend a few more days with his family.

As I was waiting to give my suitcase to the driver to put in the luggage carriers under the bus, a woman (40s or so) and her father (maybe 60s) blatantly cut in front of me to give their stuff first. I tried to politely step back around them figuring maybe they didn't see me, but they made it obvious they did in the way that they stood broadly side by side to block me and avoided eye contact. Whatever, we had assigned seats so go ahead, but I was mad at how rude they were.

I had paid for a first class bus ticket which is a smaller section in the front where you get a seat that reclines all the way, a snack box, blanket, pillow, and personal movie screen. Then there's the regular section where there's a shared movie screen and your regular coach bus seats (smaller, more cramped).

The first class section was pretty empty. There were 12 seats or so, and only me and two older ladies who were very friendly. My screen didn't have any media in English so I moved around and found a better seat. Halfway through the trip there's a stop to buy a snack and use the restroom, so I took my half hour break to do that and walk around and came back to the bus to find this lady and her dad in my ""new"" seat and the one next to it, reclined, and the dad cuddled under my blanket (ew!)

So I went back to my crappy seat with no English movies, steaming about this. There are stories of people hopping on buses (sometimes to rob people) without tickets so they count passengers but don't check tickets often. I went to the back of the bus pretending to get some water, but saw the lady counting people and said quietly, ""I'm sitting up front and there are two people there I didn't see before, that definitely weren't in those seats before the stop. I just want to make sure it's safe."" She looked alarmed and asked all of the first class people for their tickets including me to not rat me out.

She saw they had regular tickets and said, ""Your seats are back there, you can't sit here.""
The lady said, ""BUT THESE SEATS ARE EMPTY! Back there it's crowded and cramped!""

Ticket lady: Well if you want to go to the booth outside and pay for the first class tickets you can, but the bus is leaving in a couple minutes so you'll have to hurry.

The bitchy lady argued more but ticket lady stood firm, saying, ""These three paid more for their tickets, it's not fair for you to not pay and get the same seats.""

They stormed back to their section and I took my seat back, and got a new blanket :-D",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cu6cbs/kicked_out_of_first_class_bus_seats_in_brazil/,pettyrevenge,189,0.0
2019-08-22 06:42:38+00:00,5318,My music's too loud for you? Try silence.,EnbyEnvy,"My brother was a sexist, ableist jerk. He believed that there were two genders: men, and the mere females who existed only to serve men. He also believed that mental illness was just an excuse for stupid people to get out of work and that all psychiatrists were quacks. Since I'm both mentally ill and female, I was less than scum in his eyes, and he made sure to tell me this at every occasion. He hated it when I enjoyed something, and decided that me listening to music with headphones on was unacceptable.

I walked by him when he was pounding the piano, and when he noticed me wearing earphones he whined about how loud my music was. By this point I'd learned it was less of a headache to give in and avoid his tantrums, so I told him I'd go to another room. Our house was long and skinny, with the piano at the farthest East side. I walked out of the room, closed the door behind me, walked through the kitchen, closed the door behind me, walked down the stairs, closed the door behind me, and then pressed myself against the farthest West wall. My music was turned down so low I could barely hear it over his piano ""playing"".

The piano ""music"" stopped. I turned off my tunes and heard a door open.

*No. He is not seriously gonna...*

I heard his walk through the rooms, opening the doors, and then he confronted me. ""Your music is too loud for me. You have to stop.""

I jumped up with murder in my eyes, and he fled. But that was the LAST straw.

The next day, I waited until Mom was making dinner. (sidenote: she listened to the news on the radio while making dinner. My brother hated that and told her on multiple occasions that she should remain silent while serving him. She was not a fan.) I walked past my brother as he beat the piano, and made a point of bobbing my head with my earphones on. When he saw me, he started whining about how loud my music was.

I called Mom into the room, and asked him to repeat himself.

""Her music is TOO LOUD! It's REALLY bothering me! Mom, make her stop!""

I looked him dead in the eye and said ""Do you swear on Grandpa's grave that you can hear my music?""

He said he did. So I opened my Discman to show that it was empty. ""Please point to the CD that is making noise.""

He went pale, and Mom got furious. ""Were you lying?!""

""N.. no! No, she had her music on!""

""How?"" I said with a huge smile. ""Are you lying? You swore on Grandpa's grave you could hear my music!""

He was floundering, so I decided to twist the knife deeper. ""Oh, wait. Were you hallucinating? That's a sign of *mental illness*. Maybe you should see a *psychiatrist*.""

He threw an absolute shitfit. I'm talking toddler-style tantrum, on-the-floor-kicking-and-screeching. Mom yanked him into the kitchen and screamed at him for almost an hour about how she was sick of his shit.

TL:DR we hired a new guy and were showing  the office.  He took the first sip out of a new pot of coffee and tossed it to remake it.  Fired him.

I don't remember the guy's name but I do remember many of our local staff knew him from the neighborhood.    He came in and mentioned J\*\*\* said to stop by for an interview.  I had answered the door and took him to the office manager.  We were a family owned business and did everything face to face, not online.

He comes in and meets my office manager.  They have a conversation about past work experience, how he operates etc...   I am in the room just up the steps making a pot of coffee.   I am about 15-20 feet from them and can hear everything.  He's a little over the top but I figured he was trying to impress us.  Our office had 3 floors, the top floor was an employees break room, kitchen, shower and 3 desks/work stations.  

The manager is happy with what he hears from the guy as far as work goes.  Tells him he's hired and tells him he's show him the office and introduce him to everyone.   

Coffee was done, I called down to the manager because I knew he'd want a cup, and offered new guy one too.  I get a cup, manager gets a cup, new guy gets a cup.

New guy pitches a fit because he doesn't like strong coffee.  Pours his out in the sink, gets the **POT** and pours that into the sink!   Manager  looks at me as if to ask which one of us should kill this guy.  We're a 24/7 operation and we all love our coffee.   It's our life blood and we all make it the exact same way.  In fact, it was the office manager that taught me how to make coffee when I started drinking it.

New guy now goes on a rant about how weaker coffee has more caffeine and how things are going to change and he'll teach me the right way to do things. NOTE- lighter roasts of coffee are higher in caffeine.  The longer you roast the coffee beans the more caffeine burns off.  How strong you brew your coffee is a matter of taste.  

I let him brew a pot.  It looked like  lemonade.  It had a yellow tint to it and did not resemble any coffee I had ever seen.  New guy held it up to show us and we could clearly see him through the pot.   FYI- I don't care if that's what he liked, it was his condescending attitude that raised flags.    He's no longer over the top, he's now obnoxious.   

Manager tells him he should probably shut up if he really wants the job.  

He brushes off manager and then tells him we'll learn a lot working with him.

I said, ""wanna bet?""

He took offense to my tone and laid into me.  Ended with a ""who the fuck are you""?

My manager says, ""he's the owner so he's your boss""

I looked at the manager and told him he's half right.  No way I want that guy working for me and fired him.   He was literally hired and fired in less than 15 minutes.     We talked about this guy for years.  TBT, I'm glad we found out he was not a good fit before he caused bad feelings among the crew.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/ct95uy/guy_hired_less_than_5_minutes_ago_throws_out_my/,pettyrevenge,359,0.0

There are quite a few documents involved, because I have multiple homes insured with them.

Recently, I logged onto their website to pay my credit card bill.  I received a message that I must answer a questionnaire, and that if I didn't do it within three times of logging in, my online access would be cut off.

So I went to the questionnaire, and the VERY first question was, ""What is your annual income?""  In my opinion, the only people besides the government who are entitled to ask that question are investment advisors. 
 
The second question was, ""What is your net worth?""  Again, none of your damn business.  It appeared to be a fishing expedition to establish which of their clients should be pestered to use their ""wealth management service.""

So I went to my bank, and I was told those questions are NOT required to be asked under the Patriot Act.  I then contacted the original company, and asked why they were asking me those intrusive questions.   A couple of grunts at the company mumbled about the Patriot Act, and I finally asked for a supervisor.  She gave me the same story, and I asked why huge banks like Citibank and BofA don't find it necessary under the Patriot Act. She got snippy.

So I told her that since my internet access might be curtailed, I need to go to paper statements.  I also listed myself as visually impaired, which means they send me the documents in large type.

My mom is very blunt, straightforward, and doesn’t take crap from anyone. 
When she was a junior in college, she moved into an on-campus apartment complex. What she found when she opened the door were roaches. Lots of roaches. 

She called the manager of the complex to complain and ask them to come spray. The manager smugly replied, “cockroaches aren’t a problem. And besides, there’s nothing we can do about them.” 

Later that night, Mom was horrified to find a roach on her toilet paper roll. She had almost used a roach to clean herself. At this moment, she snapped and planned her revenge. 

She emptied a bottle of applesauce and poked holes in it. The holes were large enough for the roaches to breathe; but small enough so that they wouldn’t escape. She then spent the rest of the weekend collecting every single roach in her apartment. 

Come Monday morning, mom went to the front office, holding the jar behind her back. Asked to speak to the manager. Manager came out. 

Mom: hi, I’m (name), I spoke to you Friday regarding my roach problem? 

Manager: right, and again, it’s not a problem. 

Mom opened the jar of roaches and dumped them on the managers desk. Manager jumped up and screamed bloody murder. 

Mom; what? I thought you said roaches weren’t a problem? 

The manager immediately called an exterminator and mom never saw another roach in that apartment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/crtx4s/roaches_arent_a_problem_huh/,pettyrevenge,169,0.0

2019-08-16 20:53:32+00:00,7496,"If it's not here by 5, I'm not paying for it!",SumoNinja17,"TL:DR- had to get a car to dealer before 5:00 or they didn't have to pay, they tried to get it without signing and I threw the keys away making them admit they had it and had to pay for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Years ago I drove a tow truck and we delivered a lot of cars to dealers.   One little dealership was notorious for having jerks working there.    It was like all the high school bullies got back together and open a car lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Got a call on a  Friday after lunch, from a client asking me to deliver a car to the dealership, and they had to have it before 5:00 pm, or they didn't have to pay for it, and by pay for it, I mean the car and the tow bill.   This would be no problem, the car was a couple blocks from me and the dealer was about a mile away.   I went and hooked the car and headed to the dealer.   It was 3:30 pm when I left my office.

&amp;#x200B;

I get to the dealership and go in to find someone to sign for it.  No one would sign, they told me to just park it around back.   Knowing what jerks these guys were, no way was I going to leave it there without being able to prove they got it before 5.   I talked to the new car manager, used car manager, service manager and finance manager.  No one would sign for it, and they were taunting me almost looking for a fight.   OK.

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped the car and drove it up to their front doors, got out and locked it, backed up and looked at the crew inside laughing.   I backed up another couple steps and threw the keys onto their roof.   They lost their shit!   I waved and left.

&amp;#x200B;

I  was back in my office in less than 5 minutes.  By this time, it's about 4:45pm.   I walk in and my boss was on the phone and laughing, he called me right into his office and put the call on speaker.   Our client was on the phone as was the GM from the dealer.   The GM was a lunatic about his showroom being blocked by the car and me tossing the keys on the roof.  

&amp;#x200B;

My client and boss knew these guys were jerks and wanted to know what happened.  I told them no one would sign for the car and it had to be there before 5:00.   GM said right!   I said, so it's before 5 and you're calling to complain the car is blocking your showroom.

&amp;#x200B;

GM- YES!

&amp;#x200B;

At this point my boss, the client (Mike) and I were all laughing hysterically.   The GM got madder until I could catch my breath and call his crew out for not signing for it.  They were going to say the car got there after 5 so they didn't have to pay if I didn't have proof of delivery.  That's kind of hard to do now because the GM was on the phone at 4:45 complaining about the car on his lot.

&amp;#x200B;

*Brother 1* is the one-upper. He has a CLASSIC case of green mushroom syndrome. No matter what the situation is, the context, WHATEVER, he has to be the one on top. It make having normal conversation with him virtually impossible. I'll give you a few examples of the types of responses he gives to normal everyday situations/conversations:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Wow this burrito from Chipotle is incredible. I need to eat here more often.

*Brother 1*: UGH eww holy shit dude those suck, there is this burrito place like a mile from here that is ABSOLUTELY the best. Nothing is better than it, hands down.

or

Me: I've been listening to this podcast recently, it's called the H3 Podcast and it's so funny. You should check it out man, I think you'd like it!

*Brother 1*: Oh god no, fuck that. I hate H3H3, totally not my humor and not something I want to listen to. I'd rather listen to Rhett and Link's Ear Biscuits, SO much better.

&amp;#x200B;

You get the point. This is something that's been an issue as long as I can remember. He CRAVES this sort of interaction so he can somehow feel like he ""wins"" the conversation or something. Well... That's where **Brother 2** comes in...

**Brother 2** is incredibly intelligent. He's quick witted and can give a 200 IQ response in the right moment. He's typically a quiet observer, and generally doesn't interact with *Brother 1* often because of how almost every interaction plays out. **Brother 2** and I tend to talk about the ""one-up"" mentality of *Brother 1* relatively often, since its something that's such a defining quality of his personality. **Brother 2** and I have nearly lost our minds having to deal with these sorts of interactions...

So the petty revenge story starts here.

*Brother 1* is sitting at the kitchen table, eating some fast food and drinking a blue Monster energy drink.

**Brother 2** walks in, sees the energy drink, and seizes the moment.

**Brother 2**: Hey man, what do you think about Rockstar energy drink? That stuff is so good.

*Brother 1*: UGH \*makes gag noises\* (this gag noise is legit the most forced, fake gag ever and he does it a lot) that shit is NASTY. No way, nope. That stuff sucks. You know what's better? Venom energy drink. ABSOLUTELY the best.

**Brother 2**: Oh really? Okay yeah, I'll have to try it. What about Red Bull? That stuff is to die for! I always used to drink it back in college.

*Brother 1*: OH NOO NOO, that tastes like piss! No way I could drink that crap. Venom is my energy drink choice, NOTHING is better than it.

**Brother 2**: Yeah yeah, I'll try it eventually. It must be really good if you speak so highly of it...

(A brief silent moment passes)

**Brother 2**: But honestly, my FAVORITE is blue Monster, there is NOTHING better than that.

*Brother 1*, completely oblivious to the fact that hes been guzzling this blue Monster down, instinctively responds: EWW \*gag noise\* no no no, that shit is nasty. \*gag noise\* Dude stop bugging me about energy drinks man, Venom is number 1, end of story.

At this point, **Brother 2** soaked the moment in. He waited until *Brother 1* OBVIOUSLY noticed that he was drinking that exact energy drink, then said...

**Brother 2**: Oh dude, then why are you drinking a blue Monster right now? I thought you said that shit is nasty?

The look on *Brother 1*'s face was priceless. He had no words, choked down his food silently, and fled the kitchen.

The revenge was so petty, and that moment has lived on between **Brother 2** and I ever since.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cpqbvg/brother_is_a_classic_oneupper_but_ends_up_losing/,pettyrevenge,235,0.0

Enjoy a bunch of people showing up for a garage sale.,Tweho,"Basically a ""friend"" constantly owed me a little money for cigarettes, beer that I would pick up. He would promise every time to pay me back, and I would go out of my way to get him what he asked for. After a while I stopped wanting to do so, and he would get angry. I asked for the small amount (under 20$) that he owed me for previous purchases and he pretty much told me to get off his property and not talk to him anymore. 

Well, after about a week of this going on and me not getting the money back, I decided to take this into my own hands. I posted a craigslist ad for a estate sale saying all must go, starting at a ridiculously early hour and saying he spoke spanish. Told people to text or call him anytime for questions and posted his real name and #.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Got a bunch of people to randomly show up to his house at an early hour looking for a garage sale and calling him regarding it. Feeling pretty good about it as i'm done being taken advantage of.

So I'm the third or fourth person in line at a stoplight. The light turns green. The people in front of me start moving normally, and before it gets to be my turn by any reasonable estimation the dude behind me starts leaning on his horn and making rude gestures for me to move. No thanks, I don't like hitting other cars. It's way too much paperwork.

Then I realize where we are. We're coming up to a busy rotary. It's a one lane road, and this is the sort of rotary where you gotta have a certain amount of nerve to hop in or you're sitting there for a long, long time waiting for it to clear out. Gosh darn it, I was feeling like a nervous driver who needed a nice, big clear space before I was comfortable pulling into that rotary today. 

After about thirty seconds he was leaning on his horn again and making rude gestures. I decided that scared me and I started visibly startling and looking around every time he did it. This, of course, took my eyes off the rotary and only made the entire thing take longer. I missed a couple good chances to pull out looking around to see why there was honking. He was red faced and looked to be screaming long before a space big enough I felt ""comfortable"" pulling into arrived.

2019-08-07 19:43:30+00:00,3543,"""""Be a good neighbour"""" says the harassing note",macaronic-macaroni,"Obligatory first time post, as I don't tend to be petty, but. 

So I live in a suburban area of a fairly large city, renting a basement suite with a friend. I moved into this spot recently, and would say I'm a pretty chill person to live around; I work full time, and go to classes, so am rarely home, so basically never disruptive. One important thing about this neighbourhood is that it has no drive ways, but street parking is plentiful, and it is never hard to find a spot within steps of your house on either side of the street. 

I have been often parking directly across the street from my place, as that way I don't have to turn around when I get home, and there has always been spots in front and behind me. I tend to only drive my car about once a week, and getting into it this morning, I noticed multiple notes.

The first, a full page tucked under my wiper blades read ""be a good neighbour, park on your side of the street like you told us.""

What the hell, I just moved into this neighbourhood, and have certainly never spoken to anyone on the street. Also strange and unsettling that they would know I live on the other side of the street, as that means they've watched me leave my car, and I tend to only drive really late, since I work the night shift.

Since apparently I didn't respond quickly enough to their first note, they then left a second, a series of ""????"" post-its on my windshield. I think whatever, probably just an over-controlling old person, it's no biggie for me to turn around and park on the other side. 

I park on the ""correct"" side of the street, wanting to avoid confrontation; until the other night. I had gotten off late from work, pull into my street, park, and hop out of my car before I totally register that I didn't turn around. At this point it's 1:30am, and I'm like whatever, I'm sure it won't affect anyone. 

Wrong. The next morning there was an even more passive aggressive sticky note on my windshield, calling me inconsiderate and disrespectful. Cool, I can do that.

I have a membership to a car-sharing service in the city. How it works is you can unlock a car from an app, pay by minute that you drive, then park it and leave it in allowable zones; one such zone is on my street.  I decide I'm going to do a little commute home, and find every car within walking distance from me. One-by-one, I rent reach car, driving to my street, and parking it, directly across from my house. By the time I'm done, within a quarter-block, there is a series of rental cars, taking all the north-side spots; of course, I left lots of spaces directly across the street, so there was plenty of space to park. I hope my neighbours love their parking options on the public street.

Tl;dr: new neighbours decide to be controlling and tell me to park across the street. I forget one night and they leave a rude note, so I fill their entire side of the street with rental cars.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cnaksa/be_a_good_neighbour_says_the_harassing_note/,pettyrevenge,146,0.0
2019-08-06 03:50:00+00:00,2574,Yell at me on my voice mail...here’s your new greeting.,Jeheh,"Years ago I had an appointment in the middle of the week and decided to just take the day off.  At the time I was with T-Mobile and my cell service wasn’t that great in spots and the biggie was My phone wouldn’t work at my house.  At the time I liked getting a new phone every year for free so it was a trade off I lived with. That and since smart phones weren’t quite the thing at the time I didn’t care and was actually happy it didn’t work at the end of the work day or on my days off I was out of contact. 


So one of the guys at work decide he HAD to talk to me and tried calling my cell . They had my landline number but for what ever reason he didn’t think to look it up.   Anyway he tried calling, probably about 5-6 times and finally just blew up on my voice mail with a screaming message. Now since the phone didn’t work I didn’t get the messages until after hours when I went to the store to get something. Needless to say when I stopped and saw I had a few messages I listened. The first few were just dead air, the last few were a more agitated “ Call Me” but the last one was special. “PICK UP THE GODDAMNED PHONE AND CALL INTO WORK...ASSHOLE“


I have a service on my phone I’ve used for years that allows me to make multiple voice mails and assign the, to individuals. Usually my message is short and to the point  “hi leave a message” but for a few extra specials people I have the ability to make it play “Dancing Queen” for about 3 1/2 minutes and the hang up without allowing the person to leave a message. But this was going to be different.  


So when I got home I saved the message and reused it as my new voicemail for my coworker.  So the next time he called, there was no “ hi leave a message” but “PICK UP THE GODDAMNED PHONE AND CALL INTO WORK...ASSHOLE” in his own voice and it would hang up without allowing him to leave a message.  

I asked him the following morning wtf was up and it was really nothing important but he had gotten all bent over it anyway. I neglected to remind him that my phone doesn’t work at my house and there is a land line number in the system.  And I waited.  It took a few months but some other random day I was off and he called, got his own voice yelling back at him and click.   He called it 3 times within 2 minutes.  

The next morning he caught me at the door, still pissed and I said “ you do know my phone doesn’t work at my house...right? And my landline number is in the system for that reason”.

2019-08-06 00:43:02+00:00,2036,GF dumped me after booking a trip for her birthday. Cheers to petty revenge!,highlimits,"This occurred a few years back. A little back story that is relevant, she was my best friend (lets call her Sal) in college and the girl that made me realize I was gay. I finally worked up the courage to come out to her right before summer break. I thought this was the best time to protect myself if she ended our friendship because at least I could try to get over her during the summer. She actually took it really well and we ended up dating for 3 ½ years. Being that it was both of our first times in a lesbian relationship, we had many new experiences and difficult times. One thing that was extremely evident was how much I was head over heels in love with her. Sal had not been in many relationships and was still trying to figure out her sexuality. Unfortunately for me, we broke up a few times because she was not ready to commit to the level of seriousness that I was willing to in our relationship. 

After we graduated college, we lived separately but in the same city and were on again/off again. We were on for a long enough period that we decided to book cheap airline tickets 5 months out to Guadeloupe to celebrate her birthday. Not a long time goes by and she dumped me again. Frankly, I was pissed at her and more mad at myself for buying the ticket based on our dodgy track record of stability post college. I decided that I was still going to go on the trip without her. My two best guy friends bought tickets to accompany me and we were counting down the days to our trip. A month before we were set to leave, Sal comes back into my life. Stupid me decides to date her again BUT I decided that I wasn’t going to tell her about still going to Guadeloupe. She had just started a new job and couldn’t get the time off so she had cancelled her ticket. I waited until 2 days before the trip and told her that I was indeed still going to Guadeloupe. She was pissed. I was checked out by this point in our relationship that I didn’t give a damn. I was set to move across the country in 3 months and was tired of continuing to have my life revolve around her. 

For her birthday, I was sipping piña coladas on the beach with my two best friends. That trip was a blast and my first step to realizing that my friends will be there regardless. As for Sal, I haven’t talked to her in 3 years and she’s yet to go to Guadeloupe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cmjl32/gf_dumped_me_after_booking_a_trip_for_her/,pettyrevenge,44,0.0

Now after a heavy night out my friend asked me to pick him some bits up whilst I was out, he gave me his card and off I went. I grabbed our items and went to the self service check out. I paid for his items and mine were still in the basket, bagged them and put the items on the floor. A woman rushed over and shoved her stuff on top of mine, I explained I still needed to pay for them items and she huffed at me and asked why I just bagged other stuff and not mine.

My husband and I use wet wipes at home. Yes we are full grown adults, no there are no babies in the house. We just feel this is a much more effective way to get clean after using the toilet. 

He, however, ALWAYS leaves the container open so the first wipe dries out and is basically useless. And Murphy’s law being what it is, it’s always me that gets to use that now-dry wipe. 

I pick it up, do a mini tantrum, reach over to the sink run some water on it and then use it. No biggie if it’s just a couple of times but it gets old real fast. 

Soooo I started taking that first wipe out, using the second one and then putting the dry one back in at the top so that he would get it instead.

I queried this several times and got a few barely literate responses back that Gibraltar is ""outwith the uk"", and point blank refusing to refund the transactions, even though I pointed out they had never done this before with other ATM's in Gibraltar.

It was the first house we were able to afford and we took good care of it. A family of dirtbags moved into the other side. We became somewhat friendly. Both parents worked, and as I already watched 2 children before and after school, I took on 3 of theirs, as well. They paid regularly with no problem. The house aged poorly over the next several years and really needed a paint job. Obviously we couldn't paint only one side. We all discussed which contractor to hire, how much to pay, what color to paint, etc. My husband and I put out the money, and it was arranged that the neighbor would pay their half when the job was done. They then flatly refused. We were shocked, but had no recourse, as we thought that since we were friendly and lived so close together we didn't need a written agreement. So, we kept up our friendliness, and I began to overcharge them for the daycare a bit every week. They didn't notice. About a year later, we were sitting having coffee. I said ""congratulations, you're all paid up"" with a big smile. The wife looked confused, and asked ""what are you talking about?"" and I gleefully said ""I've been overcharging you for a year, and you're finally done paying your $3000 for the house painting!""

We became decent friends after we and some other people on our floor would hang out every weekend or so.  Jenna and her roommate (a nice nerdy girl) lived in a double that shared a bathroom with another double. It was set up in a way that you could walk freely between the two rooms via the bathroom (both bathroom doors had locks on both sides for privacy when you needed to use it).  Well Jenna's ""suitemates"" were these two attractive party-type girls who gave no fucks and never cleaned, as in overfilling the trash can with used tampons and the like.  I'll refer both of them as DosFucks.  Jenna would occasionally complain in passing about them being inconsiderate and dirty throughout the fall semester.  

One day during the spring semester I overheard from our mutual friend that while Jenna and her roommate weren't in their room, DosFucks came in and stole her full length mirror.  She was upset and cried at one point.  I was livid.  I remember reading someone's comment on some messageboard about a prank where you would fill up a manila folder full of shaving cream, slide the open end under a door, then stomp on it.  The force of the stomp would spray it everywhere on the other side of the door.  Bingo.  I strolled my ass to the pharmacy and office supply store to pick those up, returned, and waited until late on a weeknight.  I sporadically walked by DosFucks' room to make sure I didn't hear any sounds, likely to be asleep.  When it was time, I loaded it up as much as possible.  I slid my thing in, and shot my load. Holy shit it was loud! Makes sense when you're stomping on tiled floor.  I quickly grabbed the envelope and ran to my room then went to bed.

I told Jenna what I did the next time I saw her and we had a good laugh. She told me several days later that DosFucks asked her if she knew who did it and that it was annoying af to clean. She basically shrugged her shoulders.  I proceeded to do it several more times before the semester ended.

2019-07-23 22:40:03+00:00,11640,I cut my lawn in random directions because it makes my neighbor crazy,uninterestingdream,"Neighbor is a retired 70something former preacher or pastor or whatever. He's also a judgmental prick who, despite not living in a neighborhood with an HOA, makes weekly rounds through the neighborhood looking for any minor code violations (things like flowers that are overhanging onto the sidewalk by an inch or two, etc) he can report to the city to get the owners fined. He mows his lawn twice per day during the summer and has a bed of green that would make Hank Hill cream himself.

I take pride in my yard, but it's 70% native plants and wildflowers with a small patch of grass in the front. I don't water the grass because pouring water on the ground seems stupid to me, but it (along with a healthy mix of other stuff) comes in pretty full and there aren't any bare spots anyway. I mow every five days, less if we're in a dry spell and it grows slower.

Anyway, when I get out there, I cut all the grass, but with a focus toward leaving a path that is as baffling as possible. Sometimes I will attempt a checkerboard and then veer off into spirals, other times I will approach with an even more abstract eye. The grass doesn't seem to mind and I enjoy the challenge of thinking of new ways to traverse the lawn.

Today I saw my neighbor standing out front with his fuckup grandson that got sent to live with him for some reason. He was complaining to him about something, throwing his hands up in the air, clearly very exasperated...

Then he gestured toward my lawn and then made a little spiral gesture while contorting his face in disgust. I don't know exactly what he said, but I imagine he was lecturing him about how if he didn't get his life together he'd end up like me, the neighbor with the weird lawn.

2019-07-22 10:55:40+00:00,4460,Guess I Was Too Stupid To Know Any Better,Fyrefly12,"This is my first time posting and I'm on mobile so please excuse any mistakes. 

A bit of background: I've worked in the service industry since I was 16, and it's a place where you will see the absolute worst of humanity. Seriously, people can really suck. I have loads of stories of entitled ass holes, but not that many revenge stories. This is one of the times I got my revenge and some manager couldn't just override anything I did. 

On to the story. 

When I was 18 I worked in the restaurant section of a big multi story department store. For the Brits here, it was a Debenhams. A kind of middle-class clothing/homeware department store. During the weekday afternoon it was quiet so there was usually one server and one supervisor. In the quiet times I would do some deep cleaning and today was the day that the fryers were to be emptied and cleaned. My supervisor was in the office doing rota so I was out front. I would serve drinks and cakes and make food when it was required. Enter the douchebag. 

Probably early thirties with a toddler on the hip, about two years old. He picks up a sandwich and I ring it up, asking whether he would like drinks etc and he asks me why the deal wasnt on.

""Our afternoon deal at the moment is to add a packet of crisps and a drink for an extra £2 to any sandwich. Did you want the deal added on, sir?"" 

""No, the deal to add a portion of chips to any sandwich for £1."" 

Now I had been there for about 8 months and I had never heard of this deal. So I kindly inform the man that we didnt have this deal on and he went from zero to ten in the blink of an eye. He started shouting at me, telling me how stupid I was for not knowing about this deal, how he would get it every time he came in etc etc. In between the ranting I asked when he last got this deal. He told me last year. I didnt really know what to say at this point so I went to get my supervisor. 

My supervisor was a nice guy but he was a pushover and hated confrontation, so while he spoke to the customer and was berated for hiring a stupid young girl (me), I could see my supervisor was going to crumble. While my supervisor worked on the till to try and find a way to add some chips for £1, the customer started to talk to his toddler. 

""What a stupid girl for not knowing about daddy's deal. Dont worry, son, I'll never let you work in a shitty place like this. I'll make sure you get a good education so you're not stuck in a dead end job with the IQ of a walnut."" 

I'm at the other end of the counter, listening to this, getting incredibly pissed off. Nevermind the fact I was in my first year of uni and I had to work to live at the same time. So as soon as I hear my supervisor telling the man he'd found this deal, I went out back. I had everything ready to deep clean the fryers, so I opened the valves and emptied out all the oil. By the time my supervisor came to the kitchen to tell me to put the chips on, I was already squirting the cleaning agent into the empty fryers. 

The look of horror on my supervisors face made me feel a little guilty, because now he would have to deal with the guy. But then again, he didnt stick up for me and gave this guy a deal which we weren't even supposed to do all because the customer was a manchild. 

The guy howled like a banshee when was he was told that he couldn't have the chips. I was in the kitchen listening, happily scrubbing the fryers. The guy threatened to have all our jobs, and he did write a letter of complaint to the store manager. But we didnt get told off because this 'deal' didnt exist in our system. 

Guess I was just too stupid to know that chips needed fryers. Damn my lack of education, eh?",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cgbpz9/guess_i_was_too_stupid_to_know_any_better/,pettyrevenge,106,0.0

I immediately fell to the floor and cried out in pain (no I wasn’t touched) and brought on the waterworks so quickly that even his buds thought he somehow got a punch in. The principle grabbed him and dragged him to the office and had me go to the school nurse.

He was suspended for hitting a girl even though his mother had taken him to the hospital because he was in so much pain. He never confronted me ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/cfa9j8/bully_attacked_me_and_ended_up_in_hospital/,pettyrevenge,139,0.0
2019-07-18 07:57:03+00:00,3778,Dick the dick of a stepdad receives petty payback after 30 years,hettstain,"Yep, this story is definitely longer than it needs to be for the petty revenge at the end. I'm okay with that.

When I was about 13, my mom married a complete loser asshole piece of shit. My parents had recently divorced after 15 years of marriage, and I guess Mom was feeling vulnerable. Enter Dick, so named here because he was one.

**LONG BACKGROUND. SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR THE PAYOFF.**

When I first met Dick, he seemed cool to me. He'd talk about stuff like UFOs and astral projection and other nonsense that I  was ready to believe at that age; he had really cool stories of the stuff he'd done; and he talked to me more like a friend or older sibling than a parent. I only found out later that he was a total douchebag.

After a while, the shine started to come off the bubble. Dick was always out of work, but of course he had one totally valid excuse after another. I also started to notice that he was often bitchy and overly critical of others and frequently verbally abusive, especially toward my younger siblings. The more closely I listened to his stories, the more outlandish  they sounded, and the more holes I noticed. 

He'd won some weightlifting competition at the state fair. He'd been a door gunner on a chopper in Nam. He'd played bass in a band, or sometimes it was drums. He'd been around the world as crew on a cargo ship. And on and on. The clincher that he was totally full of shit came when I was telling him about how I was learning about logarithms in algebra, and he said, ""Oh, yeah, I'm real good at logarithms. That's easy. It's just rise over run."" (So he not only confused logarithms with tangent, but also didn't really understand either.)

Anyway, the more I paid attention, the more I saw what a childish, mean-spirited, lying sack of shit Dick was. He was constantly snapping at my mom, my siblings, and me over the most trivial of things, and his stories became embarrassingly transparent. I honestly, literally felt embarrassed listening to him.

The came the first time I got laid.

He'd previously seemed cool about sexual stuff. We'd trade dirty jokes, and he'd let me look at his secret stash of porno mags. If I went on a date he'd ask if I ""scored."" Stuff like that. However, one night when I was 17, I said I was staying over at my friend Greg's house, but actually I stayed at the house of the girl I was dating. He happened to drive past her house early the next morning (or maybe he was specifically out checking up on me) and saw my car parked there, so he knew I'd lied about where I spent the night. Dick. Went. Fucking. Ballistic.

I get home a couple hours later. He's not there, and my mom is acting a little concerned. She shows me a note he wrote to her. Lots of rambling and attacking me, but basically, ""Your son is a disgusting pervert. I want him out of my house."" Ha! ""His"" house. It was our house long before we met him, and he'd been contributing little and mooching a lot the whole 3-4 years he'd been there. Fuck him.

Mom knew Dick was overreacting, and while she was unhappy at me for lying to her, she wasn't flipping out about it. She was half pissed off about the lie and half worried I was going to get a disease or make her a grandma way too soon.

**ALMOST THE PAYOFF**

So I got laid, Dick found out, and he wrote a vicious note to my mom telling her what a piece of shit her son was. One of the things in that screed was a rant along the lines of, ""All that staying after school 'to work on the computers' bullshit is fake. He's just pretending to be a good student but really he's just out screwing every whore in town. He's gonna be a loser his whole life. Computers my ass. Blah blah blah."" I could hear his stupid voice pronouncing it ""whooore"" as I read it. Yep, all those years of straight As were fake. Maybe he thought I'd been banging all my teachers since I was 8 or something. 

Fucker went so far as to take a printout of a programming project I was working on, separate the pages, and crumple them up in a heap on my bed. This was back when a fanfold printout was an invaluable debugging tool. Granted, it was easy enough to print out another copy, but it was the weekend, so he made it a real pain for me to make any progress before Monday.

Anyhow, almost 30 years later, I'm in my mid-40s. Mom and Dick have been divorced since I was in college, and I've had no contact with him since. Barely ever thought about him, other than to hear the occasional but of gossip about how he's still a loser, and keeps trying to sue Mom but gets thrown out of court every time. But. I'm talking to my brother about how I'm going to be passing through the town where we grew up, and I was going to try to stop in at the bar we used to hang out at. Brother tells me that last he heard, Dick was tending bar there.

So naturally, I made a point to stop in. I was pretty sure he wouldn't recognize me. In high school I'd been skinny and had long hair. Now I have a middle-age paunch, a shaved head, and a beard. 

**FINALLY**

I'm not rich by any means, but I've done okay for myself, so I was feeling a little smug when I pulled up to the bar in a nicer car than Dick had ever had a hope of owning. I was dressed well, and looking about as sharp as a stocky 40-something can look. As expected, Dick didn't recognize me. I almost didn't recognize him, either. If my brother hadn't told me he was working there, I might not have. Where I had gone paunchy, he went the opposite way. He looked emaciated and unhealthy. Maybe he was sick. Maybe he was on meth. Don't know, don't care.

I had a couple drinks, and when it came time to pay, I got my petty revenge. Remember the torn and crumpled computer printouts? I pulled a handful of singles that I'd prepared ahead of time out of my pocket. They were each ripped partway through, and crumpled all to shit. I dropped them on the bar and dropped my business card next to them. ""Me McMynamerson, Senior Engineer, Big Ol Tech Company, etc. etc."" 

At first Dick just saw the crumpled bills and gave me a ""What the fuck, man?"" scowl. I didn't wait to see if he read the business card, but I assume he did, as I heard him mutter ""goddammit"" as I was walking out, and I could hear the cash register drawer slam hard just before I got into my car.

Fucking with him with the torn and crumpled bills was fun, but I also like to assume he saw my business card and noticed the car I got into.

&amp;#x200B;

We were in an open relationship, I had been working abroad for a few months and it was the easiest solution at the time. When I came home, we carried on being open, but from day one there had always been rules:

1. Not in my bed
2. Not where I can see it
3. Always use full protection (ie: condoms). Either use them with me, with the others or both. I had an IUD so we opted for the ""using them with others"" option

He broke rule 2 a couple of times but I was a Dumb BitchTM and let it slide.

But then one day, after showing him a meme about condoms, the truth came out that since I had returned from working away, he and one of his fwbs had been doing the do with **no** protection, not even the pill.

I threw an absolute fit, and kicked him out of my apartment, didn't speak to him again.

He tried to get to me through mutual friends and it made going out a pretty miserable experience for me.

Fast forward about six months, I'm a developer by trade, doing an internship. At one point, it was my job to test and implement an anonymous SMS sending piece of the program, and here's the petty revenge. I had to send a lot of messages to test my end of the code, the messages were untraceable (certainly for the technologically average, which is his case) and impossible to reply to.

So I scoured the internet and found legit Durex coupon codes and spammed the ever loving heck out of his number.

Anyway, the boss got a bee in his bonnet about driveoffs. (That's when someone fills up and then leaves without paying.) According to his little fantasy world, that was the fault of not only the driver, but of the person on service. He decides, without consultation that he would simply deduct the cost of the drive off from the wages of the person on till.  
I came into work on Friday night, collected my pay from the drawer, and found I was about $120 short. As I generally only earned about $300, this was a big chunk. I rank the boss and inquired why my pay was short. He explained that as I'd had two drive offs, totalling $120, he took it out of my pay. I explained that that was illegal, and that he had to pay the rest. He refused.  
Okay then. I close the store, turn off the lights, lock the doors and go home. This is friday night, possibly the busiest night of the week.  
The next morning comes. I get a series of increasingly desperate voice mails (As I switched off my phone until I woke up) The signs haven't been changed, the stock hasn't been put up, the fuel delivery turned away (As no-one was there to sign for it), deliveries of food and drinks have not been accepted. Basically, the weekend was fucked for the store.  
Eventually the boss manages to get a hold of me, where he spends the next ten minutes screaming down the phone, claiming I was inconsiderate, rude and a bad person.  
I replied, ""Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."" and hung up on him.  
Eventually his wife (who was the accountant) rang, gave a fairly sincere apology, said that my lost wages would be in my next paycheck, and to please come into work that evening.  
""No. I need that cash now. This week. If it's in the drawer when I get there this evening, I'll work. Otherwise, I'll leave.""

For some context: Our house has three bathrooms; one in the master bedroom, a main bathroom, and another in the basement. A few years ago we updated the bathroom downstairs and it's currently the nicest bathroom in the house. My younger sibling's bedroom is downstairs so, of course, she has placed all claims on it. Despite having her own private bathroom, she still will just use the main bathroom which isn't a big deal necessarily...but anyone out there who has a sibling understands that sometimes you must be do petty revenge when the opportunity arises. 

We were driving home and I realized I needed to use the bathroom, and our family always announces when we need to do that (not sure why, it's just always been this way). My sibling then argues that she needs to use the bathroom...

Me: Well just go downstairs and use your bathroom.

Sis: No that's too far, I really need to pee.

Me: You need to go down there anyways to get ready.

Sis: But I really need to go!!

Me: You have your own bathroom, just use it!

So we get to the house and as I start walking towards the bathroom, she pretty much sprints past me and pushes me to get to the main bathroom before me. I was surprised she chose this power move and I was annoyed, but saw this as a great opportunity for some sibling revenge. What she didn't realize is that I needed to poop &gt;:)

I go downstairs and use her bathroom, and I do a big, smelly poop. But I don't stop there. Did I mention she has a fan down in her bathroom? I turned it off. I should probably flush the toilet to get the smell away, right? Haha, nope. I should leave her scented candle out at least, correct? Nah, gonna put it away. Well I should at least leave the bathroom door open after I'm done, shouldn't I? Think again my friends. 

I chose to stay downstairs and play on our video game so I could be there the moment she opened the bathroom door. About 10 minutes later, she came downstairs not suspecting a thing. Then she went into the bathroom. Oh I savored the glorious moment when she screamed from the smell. I wasn't even phased when she ran over to me and yelled at me, I was too damn proud of my petty (too be fair gross and immature) revenge. She kept insisting that she used the upstairs bathroom as ""fast as she could to make sure I could use it"", but if she can use my bathroom then I should be able to use hers as well.

Anyway, last night, I went to go eat the last bit of my Ben and Jerry's half baked ice cream and, wouldn't you know it? It was gone! Needless to say I was bummed, I literally saved the best part for last. It had a huge brownie piece and like 3 chunks of cookie dough left.

2019-07-09 16:15:22+00:00,2473,A lifetime of petty revenge and sicknesses,everwiccid,"So I'm HORRIBLY ill right now and it reminded me of my childhood.  
 

See, growing up, taking care of the house was my responsibility. My dad worked 2 jobs and was exhausted, while my mother was just a fat lazy bitch. Literally any time my dad went off on her for not doing what she was supposed to be doing around the house, she verbally and physically abused me behind closed doors, blaming me for having not done them for her. The stress left me sick QUITE often, and I got sick pretty much every other month by the time I moved out the first time. Colds, strep throat, bronchitis, etc. Yet even after a visit to the doctor's office to get antibiotics, it was still my responsibility to cook and clean for her.  
 

So my lifelong petty revenge was to spit in her food. I learned early on that snot rockets were hard to break down outside a creamy dish, so it was usually just plain spit. I didn't mind dropping her food on the floor (which was a pretty gross floor given cleaning had been my responsibility since I was 4) when I had to bring her plate. Sometimes I'd drool onto her plate. And she was never the wiser. But she could never understand why she always got sick so fast, why it spread through the family so quickly.   
 

Sometime after I moved out, we got in an argument about my treatment growing up. She always says she did most of the work, that I never had to do anything around the house until middle school (hell, I was tall as fuck, she might actually believe that), and that I was a liar. I'm like, ""what about the dozens upon dozens of times I remember cooking for you with strep throat?"" She laughed in my face and said to me with a cocky smile that that NEVER happened (since she thought I couldn't prove it). So I say, ""so you never wondered why it spread so fast when I got sick? I spit in your food for fucking 12 years, woman!"" She sputtered for a few moments, turning white as she realizes. It felt so goddamn good when I left that day.  
 

I should add, she always wanted to blame my immune system problems on my brief stay in foster care... when I moved out, I went from getting sick maybe 6-8 times a year to getting sick only twice in a period of 3 years.

Soap dispenser in dispatch bathroom broke. Why do I have to tell you she said?

Maybe because I don't use it?

So it cannot be repaired so I ordered new one. I told the one girl that was working at the time I should have it in a couple days and in mean time I put in a little pump dispenser. She at least smiled and said thanks.

Little miss bitch comes to work 2 days later and see's the little pump bottle. She left a message on my work phone. A nasty one about why I thought it was appropriate to leave some walmart shit in ""her"" bathroom along with other stuff.

My cell phone pages me when I get a voicemail at work. I listen to message and I get pissed for about 10 seconds. Time for payback you little snot nosed, arrogant shit.

Dispatch is loaded with computers, electronic boards and such. It needs cooling all year round. 

I log into our building a/c computer and promptly set a/c for 90 degrees. It only took an hour for those temps to get that high in room.

She is just under an hour into her 12 hour shift. I get calls at home and on pager. Frantic like. I wait until her boss calls to answer. I ain't talking to her.

Talk to her boss and tell him I'm about 8 hours away. As long as you open secured side door equipment will be fine. He said, It'd pretty miserable for her in there. I said, I'll try to make it in 7.5 hours.

Sooooo, 8.5 hours later (my normal shift) and turn unit back on. 

In 1 hour, just min's before she leaves the temp's are down to bearable.  I walk in and her replacement is there. Bitch looks at me and is furious, hair messed up and sweated up something fierce. 

She said it's bullshit she had to stay in that room. I smiled and said, You should have called off sick.

I said I have good news though, Your new soap dispenser came in! Once it cools down a few more degrees, I'll install it. Gnight! And walked out of room.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/ca7xvf/want_to_be_a_bitch_ok_then_sweat/,pettyrevenge,116,0.0

But one day, as I was just about done, I was pushing the mop across the doorway when a very big (as in tall and athletic) dude walks in. I politely warned him about the slippery floors and he just stared at me. Then he put his back to the wall across from the urinal, dropped trou, and pissed all over the newly cleaned floors. He did this all while looking directly at me.

He smirked at me as he finished and walked out (not even washing his hands by the way!) and headed towards the counter as I hung the ""bathroom closed"" sign.

I went to talk to my manager and explained what happened. He was a good guy and told me that someone else would re-clean the bathroom and that I should go stock some cups up front. (This gave me the opportunity to witness what was about to happen.)

My manager walks up to the front counter just in time to take this guys order. The guy pulls out a sheet and proceeds to read off a large order for his company, if I remember right it was for about 30 people and they were all customized (no mustard, extra pickles, etc).

As he finished his order, my manager says ""Sir, you will not be getting food from us today.""

This man gets enraged and starts pounding the register with his hands and yelling about racism, but my manager politely informs him that he cannot urinate all over our floors and expect to be treated with respect.

The guy starts whining about how particular everyone is and that he must have food from our chain and there is not another chain for 10 miles. My manager wished him good luck and pointed out that he has enough evidence on the security cameras to call the police.

I wasnt the one exacting the petty revenge but rather my date that night was.



So I met a guy a few years back and agreed to a date with him, I suggested a movie and he mentioned he was interested in seeing paranormal activity so we picked a day, booked the tickets and off we went.



We managed to get some great seats by the aisle near the back and settled ourselves in when this group of teenage girls walks in and sits in the row right in front of us. These girls were complete bitches. They screamed at every preview and kept looking around to see if anyone was reacting to them, pointing and laughing at anyone who glared over or shooshed them. Movie started and at 1st they would scream at parts that nothing even remotely scary happened, one of the staff had to come in and threaten to kick them out if they didnt stop but unfortunately they continued for a little until they finally started paying attention to the film because it was one of the bedroom recordings with the door moving and stuff.



At this point they were finally completely silent, not even moving but my date was still salty about how much they annoyed him earlier. He took my hand, squeezed it and whispered ""watch this"" to me. He slowly leans forward to the girl directly in front of him, moves hands really slowly to each side of her then quickly grabs her and kinda quietly shouts ""AHHHH"" in her ear. This girl shits herself! She had a half full tub of popcorn that went everywhere because of how much she jumped out of her skin. Her friends had to take her out of the screen because she started crying she got such a fright and they kept glaring back at us and one called my date a bastard as she walked down the aisle. 



Date leaned back again in his seat, brushed some of the popcorn that went over him off himself with one hand, put his other arm around me and said ""worth it"". No cinema screen erupting in applause but I did spot one guy across the aisle from us snickering and someone else high fived him when we got out but that's it. Dont think those girls came back for the rest of the movie or if they did they sat well away from us anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/c8r5gc/teach_you_to_annoy_a_full_cinema_screen/,pettyrevenge,113,0.0

Today I went to see the new Spider-Man movie with my family (2 brothers, mom, dad) expecting to have a great time. As we walked into the mall (the theaters are upstairs from the shops), I notice a group of about 8 boys standing in a group. They aren't doing anything so I just keep walking. Unfortunately, as we're watching the previews, which is halfway over, the entire groups walks in yelling! Like, FFS, you don't say hi to someone across the entire theatre! They're getting shushed and such when the movie actually starts, but I could still hear some talking and ""ironic clapping"" if that even makes sense. Oh ya, they were also sitting right in front of us :( This is where is gets bad. We're a good chunk into the movie and one of these fuckers throws trash over their shoulder and it hits my mom. At first we're confused cause we don't know where it came from or what it even was. We just shrugged it off and kept watching. Later (maybe 20 minutes) they throw a crushed up candy box and it hits my mom again! This time in the face. I was fucking pissed!! My mom yelled ""KNOCK IT OFF"" but that wasn't enough for me. I grabbed my large coke, which is massive because i'm in US, and dumped it all onto the kid in front of me. Ohhhh man did that feel good. I said ""Oops looks like I spilled, better get a refill."" Listen, that kid was shook. I'm not sure what the others though but I got a few cheers from the audience.

She even occasionally had the nerve to tell me to ""calm down"" because I work fast and she looked bad in comparison just standing there.  


Eventually, I found another job, but I made a point of not bothering to mention to this girl when my last day was. I knew she was going to be unpleasantly surprised by suddenly having to take over my job the next day, so I set her up to have the worst first day ever. I used up all the good packing tape and left out only the identical looking stuff that tore easily, I hid the good tape gun and left out the identical looking but broken one, and I unhooked the UPS scale. When you unplug the scale, you have to restart the computer, and I changed the password. Resetting the password was a massive headache because IT was terrible and inevitably took a couple of hours to do anything.

Well, my towel is one that is very unique, and somebody decided to take it and then leave it with their own things, sitting wadded up on a lounge chair.

I was pretty mad that someone would do that, but the towel was starting to get worn out, so I decided I’d rather have revenge than take it back.

I went up to one of the snack stands and filled several cups with ketchup, and then filled my cup with loganberry soft drink. I mixed a concoction of the two, and then put the mixture all over the inside of the wadded up towel, and then sat myself a couple of rows back and waited. Eventually I see some entitled looking teenage boy go up to the lounge chair that had my towel, and without thinking he quickly grabbed it and threw it around his waist- then his face suddenly became very serious. I watched him undo the towel and look down in disgust. By that point a couple of people who I am guessing were his friends had caught up to him, and started berating him and laughing that he was covered in some chicks period blood 😂

2019-06-27 14:43:42+00:00,2043,An Alternate Response to Dealing With Road Rage,TALman1012,"I want to start off with a little bit of background. My car is a stick shift and for those that don't really know stick, it requires an extra step when you want to accelerate from a stop. Unlike a car with an automatic transmission which you just let off the brake and hit the gas pedal, a manual on the other hand requires you to press a clutch, put the car in gear, and then let off the clutch while applying the gas. It really doesn't require much extra time over an automatic, but it definitely isn't as instantaneous as an automatic.

Now onto the story. I was sitting at a stoplight and was at the very front of the line. The road I was on was two lanes wide, and both lanes had roughly 3-4 cars in them. The light turns green and I am reaching over to shift into gear when someone starts blaring their horn and not like the polite ""Pay attention"" beep, but a ""You just cut me off on the highway and almost killed me"" honk. Keep in mind, that the light had literally just turned green and no cars had moved yet. The horn actually made me stop dead in my tracks and I looked around (as was the car next to me) to see if someone had blown a red light or there was a close call with a pedestrian or something. That's when I look in my rear-view mirror and see that no one was in any danger, as it was the angry little man in the car behind me. And he was honking at me. 

This guy is wailing his arms around manically and screaming what I can only imagine to be obscenities at me. Now, my initial reaction is to flick this little prick off. But, I realized something and all of a sudden all of my counter-rage is gone. This guy desperately wants to go, but can't because of me and because of the wall of cars that are to his side. So, I calmly shift my car into gear and accelerate as slowly as I can through the intersection. I might have been going 5mph through that intersection. The guy realizes what I am doing and loses it. I can't even imagine what he is saying at this point.

He finally gets an opportunity to switch lanes and get out from behind me, as I am still driving as slow as I possibly can without being a total ass to the other people on the road. I am laughing hysterically at this point, thinking that my fun is all over now. But, the car that he is behind now decides to make a left turn and comes to a dead stop. I watch this guy flick off the car making the left turn, and then get even more pissed when he realizes he has to get behind me again. We get past the car making a left turn and there is now an open lane for him to pass me in. He promptly speeds up and gets around me and then cuts me off. Finally there is open road for him to rage down without any assholes like me to slow down his fast and furious lifestyle. Once again, I am thinking that my fun is over. 

Due to the slow driving and then getting stuck behind the car making the left turn, he missed the light next light that was about a block or two from where this whole ordeal originated. And remember how he felt the need to cut me off? Well now we are both sitting at the light with me behind him. He is gesturing towards me, and I know exactly what he is screaming in the car based off of the gestures. He is yelling at me about how this is my fault that he missed the light as well as some other obscenities I imagine. 

The light turned green. He was so busy yelling at me that he wasn't paying attention. So, there was only one completely rational response. I punched my horn and let it blare. 

The last I saw him do was a little nod and what looked like a small wave as he turned back to his steering wheel and drove off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/c66d3h/an_alternate_response_to_dealing_with_road_rage/,pettyrevenge,170,0.0

My schedule is 2-3 short trips per month but I am still home most of the time. My wife, let's call her Carol, and I have a great relationship despite my travel, but we occasionally fight over small things like my always increasing ""honey-do"" list. I've never been a handy man and don't like starting projects I can't finish, so the list can stay untouched during my heavier travel periods. The night before a short, two day trip, Carol and I fought over a project she has been asking for several months, a simple fix of repairing a broken screen in our window. I essentially told her ""I'll get to it when I get to it"" because I didn't think a tiny hole was a problem. Carol was not happy about this and the fight turned into a bigger one. We ended up going to bed angry with each other which is something I try to avoid. 

The next morning, I left for the airport before she woke up. Still upset over last night's fight, I decided that I was going to be petty. Carol and I normally talk every night when I travel, because normally our relationship is healthy and we appreciate checking in with each other. Since I was only gone for two days, I was going to refuse to call her in order to make her feel bad about the fight. I figured she might even call me and apologize for acting strongly over a tiny little hole in the screen. 

Two days pass and we ended up not talking at all. As my airplane landed late night Thursday, I thought to myself how I ""won"" the argument and avoided doing a silly little project. Now all I had to do was sneak in to my bedroom quietly to not wake Carol up and she would forgive me in the morning. I carefully entered the bedroom, tiptoeing in the dark but only made it 3 feet before I stubbed my toe on our giant, solid oak hope chest while yelling loud exclamations.  

Carol woke up, berating me for waking her up so late at night. I told her it wasn't my fault since I didn't know she had moved the hope chest and I couldn't see it.

Fine but you’re not having that parking spot.,Kolandromir,"Yesterday, I was on my way to visit one of our fine local retail establishments,  I was coming off one of the street entrances which was intersected at a 4-way stop with the entry to an adjacent wholesale establishment.  Exiting from said wholesale store was a lady in a red SUV.  I had reached the intersection first and was enjoying my legally mandated stop, when lo and behold, this woman proceeded hastily through the intersection with no regard for her stop sign, my right-of-way or seemingly any other rule of the road.  

But I did think to myself “meh” as I continued on my way to the parking lot entrance closer to the store. It was there that I was blessed with another vehicle leaving its space immediately across the drive lane from the front door.  I activated my turn signal light, indicating my interest in the parking space; in layman’s terms, I called dibs.  As the other vehicle was completing his exit, who should roll up behind him but the lady in the red SUV.  

I looked at her, she looked at me.  We both knew the spot was mine.  I noticed this time that the SUV was equipped with a Handicap parking permit, but it was irrelevant since this spot was not designated as such.  She put her SUV in reverse and backed away.  Victory was mine.  

Later as I was checking out, I felt a tap on my shoulder.  You guessed it, the woman in the SUV.  I’m not sure which was redder, her cheeks or the popped blood vessel in her left eye.  She said to me “You have some nerve taking that parking spot from someone with mobility issues”.  To that I responded with “I don’t know, running that stop sign seemed pretty daring to me.”  The cashier raised his eyebrows and let out an instinctive “Whoa!”  The lady’s jaw dropped and I turned to leave.

2019-06-25 21:15:12+00:00,2302,I got my handicapped neighbour's car towed.,farana97,"Okay, please read the whole thing before judging me. And apologies in advance for any errors, English isn't my first language

About three or so months ago, new neighbours moved in. They looked fine, except they seemed a bit ""spoiled"". For example, when the moving truck came, Mrs. new neighbour was complaining about a parked car because it was near her driveway/garage entrance and may bother their movers while they got their stuff off the truck, so she was saying how she was going to complain about that car and report it as abandoned so it would get towed. Luckily that didn’t happen. 

So anyway, apparently she suffers from some leg injury and she limps a little bit, enough to be considered as handicapped by the traffic laws. So a month after she moved in, I've noticed a street sign that said that the section of street between my house and hers was reserved for her car, and stated the plate number. Yeah, were I live thats a thing, and the sign is legit.

Here is the issue, my house is in a very commercial area, and it is hard enough already to find a parking spot, plus her house has a garage big enough to fit easily two cars, and then two more cars can fit on her driveway. We don’t have the same space, so before they moved I always parked in that place, so you can see how annoying this was, but rules are rules.

Okay, if that sign wasn’t enough last week when I left my house, I saw her car, with the plates matching the street sign, parked on our side of the street, not on her reserved spot, while the spot was free, obviously. When I came back, I saw the car still parked on the same spot, but now on the reserved spot there was another car, I’ve recognized it because I've seen it there before, it was either her husband, who could have parked on their garage, or a guest, who could have easily parked on their driveway, I discarded the option of a random asshole parking on that spot because parking tickets are very expensive, and only a small fraction of people would actualy take the risk of parking there, knowing it WILL get towed. 

So I reached the conclusion that she was abusing of this privilege given to her, using that spot as a guest-reserved parking spot.

So I snapped and called a towing truck to report an illegally parked car in a handicapped place, later that day, the car was towed and a smile was parked in my face for the rest of the day.

2019-06-25 11:33:30+00:00,2258,Airline Representative gets embarrassed,GriffinFlyz,"Basically booked with Ryan Air (a huge mistake I know). Decided to book a hold case and bring two cabin bags (small roller case). 

So we arrive in the airport, head to baggage drop to drop our bags off all seems to be going well until the airline representative notices our cabin bags and starts to complain that they are too big and we can only have a small backpack as carry on luggage.

This is a new policy and evidently put in place for Ryanair to sting customers for extra money if they don’t read everything. 

So she begins to demand 80 euro for us to book out cases on. She can’t take money so we will have to go to another desk to pay then return and drop the bags off etc. 

So that is a fucking ridiculous price for two small bags, unfortunately we couldn’t just buy a backpack in the airport as the cases were pretty expensive designer gifts from my late grandmother.  

I decided to ignore her and proceed to go through security anyway as I thought the only reason this was mentioned was because I had to check in.

I then read some of Ryanair’s policies and realised this is actually rigorously enforced now and will be 120 euro to check in at the gate with the bags.

I proceed to shit myself, then realise I can actually upgrade my priority on the app for 12 euro to be able to bring larger cabin bags on board. 

This is fantastic and I’m smiling to myself regarding money saved. So we arrive at the gate to be greeted by the same airline representative albeit a little angry. 

When it’s our turn she proceeds to go on a rant about how “she told us” and that “now I have to charge you more for being an idiot”. I smile air to ear and show her my new priority boarding pass.

I then said, “yea I have priority thanks for trying to charge me a ridiculous amount of money” 

She then gets very embarrassed and red in the face, she then says “there is no need to be so rude about it, it’s company policy that I don’t tell you”. I just smiled and said, “you’re such a nice person I’m glad you work here”.


Tl;dr: airline representative tries to charge me 80 euro for cabin luggage, I ignore her and get it online for 10 euro she says I’m being rude",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/c5772g/airline_representative_gets_embarrassed/,pettyrevenge,160,0.0

So the line will be so long you have to wait to turn into the lot. If you go in the center and are facing East, you have to make a left turn to get in line. If you face West you turn right. So people facing West tend to cut people facing East because East people have to cross over a lane / wait for cars to go by. Once the line moves you have to be on it because not everyone respects one for one.

So it's my turn and this girl completely speeds up into my spot and does this victory dance and points and laughs at me.

I end up behind her and her passenger. They bring me my food but now its too late and im stuck behind the cutter. I have my food I just want to go but their order is taking forever. They get their food and pull up a bit and stop and are going through their bag right there. Like the driver is doing it. Not the passenger. So I honk and they pull up to turn out and noone is coming so now im mad and I just honk as fast as I can.

Everytime thry stop I am just honk honk honk. We get to the last stop light to turn right out of the shopping center and we have a wide open chance to go. So I kay on that horn immediately as if you were in such a hurry before to cut me but now youre not. The passenger turns around and is irate and saying something. I just look at her and honk.

Yesterday she talked to me and told me I need to stop it and I informed her that there's something wrong with my bike and it has to warm up just a little longer than normal now. Am I the asshole for giving her a taste of her own medicine?

Should I have mentioned that it's not just the noise it's the fact that they leave broken glasses and broken bottles around the driveway and yard.

2019-06-23 04:49:42+00:00,2001,Bully me in Saturday school? You're not getting that precious award.,Eudemon,"My friends and I were reminiscing old times over some drinks tonight, and this story came up. I'm not sure this story belongs here, let me know if there's a better place to post it.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in highschool, there were saturday classes you can take in addition to regular school courses. Some people use it to retake failed subjects, some take it for easy marks to boost score average for university application. I'm a Chinese immigrant, but I suck at math \*gasp\*, so I took the saturday Chinese classes to boost my marks. The classes were pretty easy, and all the students were getting along well, because everyone is there to get easy marks. That changed in the second term when a snoob of elitist joined the class.

This girl (let's call her Kat) have the most insufferable superiority complex in the world. She brags about her academic achievements in China, and constantly belittle Canadian born Chinese kids who couldn't understand her Chinese idioms. She quickly gathers a small group of worshipers ""Mean Girls"" style, and bullies other kids with ""sophisticated Chinese language"". I became one of her main targets as I'm Cantonese descent, and hence a ""southern savage"" who couldn't comprehend the elegance of her superiority. Kat quickly learn that it's unwise to bully me upfront as I'm a) physically a head taller, and b) I have a larger arsenal of Chinese proverbs to fire back. So for the rest of the term, she and her little gang resort to point and laugh from 5m aways. I don't really care about that much, but it's annoying.

Now a bit of background info on myself and the teacher. Although I immigrated to Canada at a very young age, my parents never let up my Chinese culture teachings. They lugged all the Chinese literary textbooks from China to homeschool me in Chinese, so I can write poems and read ancient texts without translation. I'm ashamed to say my calligraphy have degraded over the years from typing, but I can still hold the brush in the right way. My saturday school teacher admire my parents' dedication, and he often chat with me during recess about Chinese culture. This guy is a ""Red-fan"", who idolizes the novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", and hold it as the pinnacle of Chinese literature. He can't talk for 5 min without mentioning or referencing the novel in someway. He is also Taiwanese and hates the communist party in China. All of this becomes important later.

Setting up - The saturday school awards a student with the highest mark in each subject after final exam. It doesn't count as proper academic award, and there's no physical awards, just a piece of regular paper saying you've done well in saturday school. For the last two classes before final exam, Kat have been even more obnoxious than usual about her literary prowess. She kept bragging how she will take the Saturday school award hands down, and no ""southern savage"" is any match for her. From her refusing to speak English during all saturday school interactions, I suspect she is not doing well in English classes, and the saturday Chinese class is the only decent mark she can hope for. I started to form a plan for getting back at Kat and her precious award. I brushed up my Chinese writing from my old textbooks, and even took a bus to a library 45 min away to borrow Chinese literary books for studying.

The revenge - At the last day of school, it was announced I am the award winner, and I gleefully accepted the paper from the teacher while Kat sat in stunned silence. During the recess, Kat shouted at the teacher for justice and demanded to know why she was skipped from receiving the award. The teacher was none too pleased at Kat's bribing allegations, and asked me if he can show her my final exam. Of course I consented and watched Kat's face turned white as she read my essay. 

I wrote my final essay in rhyming couplets, in the famous ""8 sections"" style used by all Chinese scholars. I used sections of Dream of the Red Chamber to comment on historic events, condemn the communist burning of books, and the importance of preserving Chinese culture in Taiwan.

That remains one of the most satisfying moments in my life, and I'm not ashamed to brag about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/c3zcfp/bully_me_in_saturday_school_youre_not_getting/,pettyrevenge,88,0.0

The only way I can get out the front is using a gap in the hedge where the path is and that hedge is right up to the street - no sidewalk or even manageable gap. If you park blocking the path I have to either try squeezing beside the car or have to go out through the garage, round the front and up a driveway.

Well it's pretty obvious that some neighbors aren't considerable about not parking there, I already asked them if they could park maybe 3 feet further along but they still park like that regardless, and I'm not the type that would go and eat a facefull of bush and twigs scratching their cars trying to walk out in work clothes and with gear.

Instead I involved a 3rd party - all the flocks of birds that used to come to the feeder in my back garden. Over a few weeks I moved the feeders a few yards till they were out front, right under the phone/wire cables, adding a suet block feeder and bird bath too. Seed it and they will come - leaving lots of droppings all over my lawn, the hedge and most of all whichever poor bastards car is parked under the power line.

I got back home after being away for about 8 months of training for the Army National Guard.  I was the only National Guard guy in my training class, most of the other guys were regular army and ended up in South Korea, we promised to keep in touch.  I went back to work for the same sales company that I worked for before I left, I was doing telemarketing for them before I left but there was a new manager there and he had me ride along with a salesman I'll call ""M"" in the field.  I was told I was going to get a percentage of his commissions.  I could still do telemarketing in the office when I wasn't out with him if I wanted to earn some extra cash.  Well I didn't get any cut of the commissions, all I got were excuses, M would tell me to talk to the manager, the manager would tell me to talk to the office manager and the office manager told me to talk to the M.  I was owed close to $300 and they weren't paying me.  3 months later I was making money telemarketing and doing sales on my own, but it really pissed me off that I wasn't getting something I was promised.  So after a few months when I found a better job I decided to get back in touch with my buddies in Korea.  I'd still do telemarketing at the first place to make extra cash, they were happy for the leads.  I started going into the office when it was empty and calling Army Tech Control in Korea where I knew they'd be working and asking who was on duty, invariably someone I knew would be there and we'd shoot the breeze for a while.  I ran up almost exactly a $300 phone bill with these conversations, then I stopped showing up for the telemarketing.  I got a pissed off phone call from the manager a couple weeks later, ""Did you run up a $300 phone bill calling Korea?""  I said ""Yes.""  He said ""You have to pay for that.""  I said ""Take it out of my commission from when I was riding with M.""

Ok, so freshman year of college I went on spring break with a couple of my friends’ sorority. Half the girls were super cool, half weren’t. The half that wasn’t nice was super judgemental towards me, literally just because I look alt and smoked weed. Which is stupid, like they were getting hammered nightly and they’re going to judge me for that?Whatever. I didn’t really give a shit but it was annoying. 

So mid way through the week I wanted to make a grav because it’s spring break and I wasn’t drinking so this was me being wild. I find a sand bucket in the kitchen and ask all the girls in the kitchen whose sand bucket it is. Some don’t know but one group of a few girls just stare at me when I ask and give me a look. So I go outside and start preparing it and one of my friends comes outside and is pissed bc one of the girls freakd out that I was using her bucket. Turns out, it’s one of the girls from the group that I asked and didn’t reply!! I was so pissed for obvious reasons. This girl in particular had been the worst all week, staring me down as soon as I had arrived at the beginning of the week. A lot of her sisters didn’t like her either. 

During one of the last days of the trip, I hear her freaking out that she started her period and had no tampons. Apparently no one else did either (weird, a house full of girls). However, before the trip, I had dumped a whole box of tampons in my bag just in case. Like, a ton of tampons. 

So I grab a tampon and walk into the room she’s in and hold out the tampon and say “you need a tampon? I have tons more, just let me know if you need any later.” I was super nice about it too. The look on her shit eating face was priceless.  She stuttered when she answered me and could barely look me in eye now. Plus I did it in front of a lot of people so everyone saw how nice I was after she had been a bitch to me.

We are surrounded by office buildings and factories. 90% of my business is carry out, and lunch rush is my money maker. We always get extremely large orders from all of our neighboring businesses. I appreciate my customers and their loyalty. My staff and I earn decent living because of them. 

There is one company however, that purposely gives my staff an unnecessary hard time EVERY time they order. They will purposely hold whoever answers the phone on the line for 20-plus minutes just to take their order, and then never have their order ready when they call, she'll walk around office to office taking orders while on the phone laughing and giggling the entire time. Then when it comes time to pay, it will literally be 17 to 25 separate transactions. They are always unorganized with the payments and deliberately hold everything up at a snail's pace, laughing and giggling the whole time. They know they're being assholes and they think it's funny. If any one of my staff gets frustrated with them, even a little bit, they will call back and complain.

I never said anything to them about it, only because I appreciate the business. But last week they held up the line for so long, several of my customers who was waiting to pick up their food walked out because they was late getting back to work. Now their fun and games is costing me money. I had no other choice, I had to come up with something. I didn't want to flat out tell them they suck, but I wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine.

I posted a large sign in front of my cash register that reads "" If you are making multiple transactions, you may be asked to move to the back of the line after each transaction during busy times, to ensure quality service for ALL of our customers. Sorry for the inconvenience.""

Yesterday, after they placed their order I warned them of our new policy. I don't think she took me serious because she was still giggling. 

When they came to pick up their food, we was slammed. There was several people in front of them, and when it came time for them to pay there was several people behind them. After the first transaction, I asked them to move to the back, pointing at the new sign. The dumbfounded look on her face was priceless. They still had 20 more transactions left, and now it's not so funny to be inconvenienced. When they finally made their way up front the second time they was pissed, but they still wanted separate transactions. So I asked them to move to the back again. This time they asked to speak to a manager. I was thrilled to tell them I was the owner and this is my policy. I explained the situation, and told them I warned them of the policy beforehand, and there's nothing I can do.

I was sitting opposite a man who keep constantly looking at his new trainers (sneakers for you Americans) whilst wearing earphones and focused on his phone. 

Journey was going fine until the guy opposite me decided that his phone was far too important to cover his mouth whilst sneezing. 

His sneezed fairly aggressively. Pretty much the entire contents landed on me, mostly on my face and even in my eye. He didn’t even acknowledge the fact he just expelled his body fluid onto me. 

You may think “Maybe he didn’t notice”. Trust me he knew what he did. Just didn’t care enough. Other passengers sitting around me appeared shocked but in the very British manner kept to themselves. 

I noticed that he had a pair of Apple earphones, now I know that these are not noise cancelling so in my anger I proclaimed “Disgusting dirty c*nt” (Yes I know I should swear in public but considering the circumstances) 

He then continued to ignore it and act clueless, I could tell he knew. 

This is when I truly took out my petty revenge. The bogey man stop arrived and he had to walk past me to leave the train. 
To enact my revenge I put my legs in the way and stood my muddy boots all over his fresh trainers.

Ever since I moved in I started to notice my sliced cheese, that I use for making my daily sandwiches, dwindling faster than it should. I always use 2 slices per bread and I have two slices a day, 4 in total. A pack has 16 slices meaning I go through a pack every 4 days except Sunday where I don’t eat dairy or gluten. 

Anyways, i started to notice my cheese ending 1 or often 2 slices short, something that in years of buying the same cheese the manufacturers has never messed up. I investigated, when I heard tommy creep into the kitchen late at night looking for a gaming snack I would slowly creep out my door and suddenly enter the kitchen. BAM. I had caught him red handed, slice of cheese in hand, chewing the other. Tommy was startled, he panicked. “Shit, you scared me man haha, creeping about and shit”. I didn’t mention the cheese, my past affirmations were correct. 

Not even 10 minutes later Tommy went back into his gaming cave. I checked discord to see him playing his favourite game, league of legends. I log into an account I know just to see him logged in and ‘In a ranked game’.

Tommy tommy tommy.... had you not betrayed my trust and allowed my cheese to be safe inside the communal fridge I wouldn’t have to do this. I loosen his Ethernet cable ever so slightly. I hear a slam. He’s pissed. I reconnect the cable as he frantically loads back into game. 

I look back 15 minutes later and see ‘Defeat’. Hah...

For the next 2 months of our remaining tenancy I disconnected his games about 3 or 4 times a night.

In the mornings he would complain about this ‘fucking internet’. I also noticed his rank had changed from gold 1 to gold 2. Oops.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bxha0g/take_my_cheese_have_fun_losing_your_video_games/,pettyrevenge,212,0.0
2019-06-05 20:03:01+00:00,2196,owners PA keeps snitching on me. ok. fine,killerpeech," This is all about the Owner and his PA. 

so i was salary and as such, i was allowed to come in a bit late sometimes and leave early (when you let HR know). it was never a concern for anyone but the owner. ( who only was in the state 2 days a week. )  
HR has asked us to send a email if we were going to be late and to list why. not to be disciplined but just to let them know. This wasn't a problem for me.

the PA is suppose to be onsite at 8am with the rest of the office staff. (me, finance and the PA).  
The PA was almost never there at 8 (surprise) so it was up to me to unlock the building since finance didn't have the key.

(if we were late by like 5 minutes we didn't need to send a email. just if we were gonna be more then a few minutes behind). well, one time i was about 10 minutes late and i had emailed the HR lady and let her know i was gonna be late. she said that fine as PA was already there. so i arrive about 10 minutes late and get to doing my work.  
i receive a email from the owner saying that i need to be on time every day. my schedule is 8 am to 5:30 pm Mon-Friday.

this was a odd email so i went to the HR lady who I'm very good friends with. I asked her if she told the owner and she said no. considering the HR was only person i told i was gonna be late was HR i knew it had to be PA since finance was off that day. ( plus he was a chill guy. avoided confrontation when possible)

so me and HR wanted to see what the owner had AP doing for him. ( we didn't like her to begin with and we didn't trust her. ). HR said to come in late the next day by 30 minutes and not say anything. i came in 30 minutes late and again i received a email this time tagged to HR as well. me and HR disregarded the email. a few days past and PA didn't come in till like 9:30. i asked here were she was as she didn't communicate to me or HR that she wasn't going to be at the office at 8 am.(this is only important to communicate as I'm a on call person and i could have been at a store fixing something at 8 am and no one could open the door for finance as HR doesn't show up till 10 am) she said none of my business. THAT WAS NOT THE CORRECT ANSWER.

over the next month, i kept a tally of each time she was late and what time she came in and left. (she is salary as well) . I sent a good 20 late or early departures to the Hr lady was not happy about this data. Me and PA got pulled into HR office and HR let me confront PA about her emails and her time punches. she shrugged us off as she was ""protected by the owner"" in her words. this didn't sit well with me. The point that pushed me off the edge was that i had call to take care of at 8 am. i had communicated this last night to PA and HR and finance. PA said she would be there. at 9:30 finance calls me and asks if I'm gonna be coming in soon. i told him yes. ( sometimes he asks me to get coffee from dutch bros for him. which I'm happy to do.) he told me that PA wasn't there any HR isn't gonna be there till 10. needless to say i was pissed and called HR on her cell phone was as pissed as i was. Of course, nothing happened to PA.

So next time she was late to come in with no notice, i emailed everyone. the office staff, owner, HR, all the district managers, all the assist district managers in short calling out PA and her practices. there was a DM meeting being held that day anyway and all the Dms talked to me about the email. Turns out PA got a write up for all the late time. i could hear PA crying in the HR office. the owner didn't confront me either as i had, in a way, called him out on his practices in front of his DMs as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bx75y3/owners_pa_keeps_snitching_on_me_ok_fine/,pettyrevenge,147,0.0

I work in IT and have been working with EUC for over 20 years.  My manager was new to EUC and didn't like the fact I would correct her and most of the company came to me with questions and bypassed her.  After about 6 months I started to notice thing were going downhill fast.  I went to her boss and raised my concerns to no avail.  Toward the end I had to travel and she wouldn't approve my expense report when I got back.  We were not on speaking terms so I emailed her several times.  After a week and a half, I filed a complaint with HR and started looking for a new job.  The day I met with HR, they went to her manager and within an hour my expense report was approved and she made up and excuse saying the system was down so that is why she didn't approve it.  On a side note, when I met with HR I told them I felt she was retaliating against me and I felt she was going to try to get me fired.

About a week later, I get an IM from her manager asking me to come talk about an issue with a contract.  The odd thing was he asked me to meet him in an office by HR.  I get there and HR is in there.  They ask me all kinds of questions and after a while tell me they have to suspend me due to lies my manager had told them.  I was being nice and not bad mouthing my manager up to this point. Then the gloves came off and I told them the truth about everything which was easily verified if they interviewed my teammates.  HR and the VP talked among themselves and decided both of us would be suspended pending investigation.  When I handed in my phone and access card, I told the HR person, this was why I came to you as I knew she was going to try this. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I get a call saying I was being terminated but she was also.  I said I had been interviewing and I had a job lined up.  I started 3 days later,  1.5 years later my former manager still unemployed.

Fast forward a month and a half, my brother is on his way to see a friend on the other side of the Canada. I slip the dildo I've been holding onto in his carry on right before he leaves the house. It was a gel dildo, so I also inserted a long steel rod inside in Hope's it would set off the alarm at security and get him searched. I couple hours later my phone rings, it's my brother. Hes calling, still embarrassed to let me know I had won our war, and security had made him pull out the dildo infront of everyone. The best part was he was hitting it off with the cute girl in line behind him who was taking the same flight, however the conversation ended quite abruptly.

It’s completely messed up how obsessed with lighter tones these people get. This is mainly extended family, rather than my immediate family. 

One of the older women in my family came over to my home and said to me that I need to protect my skin tone, and that she had some cream I should use. She hands me a face cream and I pay no attention to what it is. She leaves and I read what’s on the face cream. It’s skin lightening cream! She had give me stuff that would bleach my skin!

So I put the cream to the side, and instead go out and buy some of that instant tan spay. I get to work and soon my entire body and face is a beautiful golden brown. 

I knew she was coming back over the next day so I wait and as soon as she saw me she actually yelled out. She asked what I had done and I said “I don’t know, I only used your cream”.  I handed her the tub and she threw it in the bin right away.

So what do I do? Close the gap, duh. So the spot he wanted infront of me, is now occupied by me. He has no other choice but to stay behind me and do the speed limit.

From day 1 of them moving in, it's been non-stop from them. I'll spare all the details, but seriously trashy people. 

They're a married lesbian couple. I'm a 30something woman. Somewhat attractive I guess. But one half of the married couple, apparently thought I was more than ""somewhat"" attractive. 

They'd get drunk out in our shared hallway. Bud light cans everywhere. Cigarette butts everywhere. Plegm wads of spit everywhere. I overheard so many drunken arguments about whatever, then I heard ""if you want to look at her so bad why don't we knock on her door"". Then came the knock. I ignored it.

Angry Psycho had a hate on for me. Started writing shit on my door. Sticking rotten food in my car intake. And just always drunk and obnoxious outside my door. I'm not gonna lie, I was nervous. She is def on the Psycho side and I didn't want any reason for her to escalate. At Christmas they had Santa and Mrs Claus things outside. They got in a drunken fight and Psycho beat the crap out of Santa. I wasn't getting anywhere near that crazy.

Anyway on with it. I knew about the ""thing"" she had for me (the admirer) and our back doors are sliding glass patio doors that lead to a small patio. This back door, is in the bedroom. Weird set up I know, but whatever.

I'd smoke a little weed, then at bedtime, I'd go take my clothes off, get into bed and watch the fireflies out the door in the hill (there's 1000's, it's really pretty). Then I noticed that from my door, I can see their patio. I've only just started leaving my curtains open, so I didn't really notice before. 

So my thought was, one of them likes looking at me, one is very jealous. So, why not give her a show, see what happens.

So every night, I'd smoke, do whatever, then go to bed. I'd strip down to nothing as usual, and notice that psycho could see me. And did see me. 

Their next argument was ""I'm not living here with that disgusting thing next door, we're moving"" - Psycho

Okay my dad checked into a hotel fairly late thinking he’s in for a nice rest before he has to be up at 4 in the morning for his flight! 
It’s 1 in the morning and the people next door are partying hard, music thumping talking and laughing pretty loud
Dad of course goes up to their door to ask them to keep it down, he’s ignored.
We reach 1.30am they’re still going if not louder this time he thumps on the door and shouts for them to shut up which he receives with only laughs. These rude people just laugh at him. 
He’s the bigger man he goes to bed and somehow sleeps through this noise. 
4am he wakes up for his shift, and turns on his tv. LOUD
When he leaves his hotel room he leaves the tv on his key in the room and as he passes the offending neighbors room. 
Plucks that nice little “do not disturb” sign off there door and leaves for his van

I parked on a parking strip that was in some little neighborhood. There's restaurants and apartments everywhere so I was lucky to find a spot. After getting my meal I go back to my car and started to eat.

About 5 minutes later I hear honking. I look in my mirror and some guy is on the street, presumably honking at me. I look in my rear view and there's obviously no place to park. I can't move up or back as I'm in between two cars. I ignore him.

5 minutes more pass and he's still there! He comes up to my window and knocks on it rudely. I roll it down and ask him what the fuck he wants.

He asks how long I'm gonna be and that he needs to park there because it's right beside his home. Shocked at the entitlement I ask him if this was public parking. He said yes and I told him to fuck off and shut the door on him. He kept swearing and insulting and eventually walked off.

I didn't go into more detail because I don't think that I have to explain to a grown man why rudely asking somebody to move from a parking spot is not appropriate. If he had asked nicely I might have considered.

He had to go park across the street. I don't understand why he didn't do that before.

Anyways, I got his lice plate and I've been calling the city over the last 2 weeks every other day complaining about somebody parking for too long. There's a 3 hour limit on public streets. He doesn't want to use the parking lot behind his apartment because it's too dirty I assume.

She and her friend were sitting in the window and middle seat while the isle seat was open. Thinking she was just confused, I asked her “Hey ma’am, I’m sorry but I think you’re in my seat”. 
“This is my seat kid, you’re reading it wrong” (I’m in my early twenties and definitely have a baby face) 
I’m kind of mad now and I go to show her my boarding pass “Actually I have my ticket right here and it says_”
She interrupts me. “I do this way more than you do kid, sit down in you’re seat there”. 
I am livid but I don’t want to hold the whole plane up so I quietly sit down and simmer. While I’m sitting there, I overhear she and her friend mention how tight their connecting flight is in DFW and how they’re worried they won’t get off the plane quick enough. Check mate you seat jacking bitch. 
So I sit back and enjoy the flight. Anytime I want to look out the window, I careen over their laps in a way that is super uncomfortable for everyone because I will be getting the view I paid for thank you very much. Then, when we land, I get my petty revenge.

This is extremely dangerous as the bike throws ""roost"" up behind. Took him weeks to pick them all up.

I went across the road and asked if there was a problem with the bike-riding. They said no, but I got the feeling they were lying to me. I told them we'd figure out a compromise but they said it was cool. I asked if it was them who had thrown the nails.....""nooooooo"". Bear in mind, the next nearest neighbours were 4-5kms away. Well out of earshot.

Next thing, the council call to say they'd had complaints from neighbours about the noise. Wouldn't say who but these guys were the only neighbours close enough to hear. I said I'd spoken to them and they assured me there was no problem. Told the council guy about the nails but he wouldn't take any action. He said he'd fine me if we didn't stop riding. I told him to take me to court but never heard back from them.

Months later, the neighbour comes over and tells me they're selling and would I stop the boy from riding when they had an open house. I said, ""come clean about the nails and we'll talk"". He ummed and ahhed but wouldn't answer. I told him I didnt want the buyers to think they were coming to a quiet country area and that if the boy wasn't riding, I would.

2019-05-18 11:29:50+00:00,2748,"If you're a leech who doesn't pay rent, probably try to be nice to the people who do.",KhaosPhoenix,"OK, this revenge is about as petty as it gets. When I was about 20 I lived in a crappy duplex with my bf at the time (now ex husband) and a housemate who was OK for the most part except for a few things. One, he had a little dog that wasn't housebroken and would shit in the living room where we'd have to clean it up. (It also shit in his room and he didn't clean it up often, but not my room not my poomonkeys) And two, he had a nasty tendency to invite moochers and leeches to stay over. One in particular became a real problem. 

So our housemate (HM) invited this Leech (L) to stay as long as he liked. L was obnoxious, a compulsive liar (had to one up everyone with EVERYTHING), and a food thief. My ex and I kept our food separate and marked out, but this douche would still eat it and then say that HM told him it was OK. HM didn't back him up, but also wouldn't stand up to him.

L also would regularly come in and change the channel when other people were watching TV, claiming what we were watching was ""stupid"" and he wouldn't watch it.

These things, plus walking into the bathroom on me twice (didn't lock so we had a rule that if it was closed, you knocked. My ex and he almost ended up in a fistfight over that one) led to constant screaming fights and a few satisfying moments.

I'm usually highly avoidant of conflict, but this guy was my exception. I lost my temper on a regular basis with this prick. I also embarrassed the hell out of him on a couple of occasions when he'd pull his ""one-up"" crap on stuff I actually knew about. (Once he tried to claim some spooky relation to Dracula, yeah, the fictional character by Bram Stoker. I was a vampire lore nut and had a book on vampire myth beginnings (pre-Stoker). It had pictures of examples of children's attributes that would be killed because they were thought to be vampires. He saw a page full of pictures and pointed to one creepy looking *thing* and claimed (knowing the book was about vampires, but not that it explained the myths) that  he got that way when he was angry. I told him he should go to a doctor and showed him why. In front of a living room full of people, I explained that *thing* was an example of children born with syphilis. The symptoms and birth defects were attributed to vampirism. He wouldn't come out of their bedroom until the party left).

Anyway, HM finally got fed up with the constant screaming and fighting and told him that he had to leave. (he didn't pay rent, we did)

So he packed his belongings into his gym bag and went downstairs to plead his case one more time. HM wasn't having it, I guess L's novelty had worn off. But while he was down there, I went into HM's room (they shared) and gathered up all the dog shit, there were a few piles, and put them into his gym bag. Then I ran to our room and grabbed a cup (we kept our stuff separate cuz that place was nasty) and filled it with hot water from the bathroom. I poured a small amount of hot water over each piece of dog shit in the gym bag. Then covered it with a T-shirt and zipped it shut.

All I know for sure is that he waited outside on the porch for his ride with that gym bag in the summer heat. I don't know how long it took for him to open it and find his ""going away present"", but I get a bit of warm happiness to imagine his surprise. 

My ex and I got married and moved out a few months after that. We couldn't take the unpredictability and strangers in and out. It just didn't feel safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bq30ok/if_youre_a_leech_who_doesnt_pay_rent_probably_try/,pettyrevenge,79,0.0

Sooo to come straight to the point:

Last year I was doing a student exchange in Brazil and met a girl from Belo Horizonte (I stayed in Rio) we became really good friends and I visited her quite a lot (stayed 3 weeks at her home in total but payed for both of us at partys as a thank you). I returned to Germany in August and at the end of last her she started asking me for money to lend to her bc I’m way to nice and naive I lent her about 200€ (not in one transaction). The thing is, I sent it over PayPal and the friends option didn’t work so I sent the money to her other the option as if u were buying something. I told her to not pay me back my money yet and just arrange everything I need when I come back in April  (Festival tickets, Bus tickets to go there etc.) she bought the festival ticket 2 days before the event and lied to my face why she couldn’t buy the bus ticket (met the guy at the festival and he told me the real story, that she simply never paid) so I wanted my money back, wellll surprise surprise she didn’t have money and blocked me everywhere. 

I use PayPal quite often so I know how it works and opened cases to all the transactions and simply said I never received anything, as if I had bought something. She used her uncles bank account for this and rarely looked at her email so it was no surprise for me to get my money back (all of it, even for the festival ticket). I got it back yesterday, blocked her and changed my number some days ago (she blocked me some weeks ago on my old number). To make things even better all of our mutual friends are on my side and after she kicked me out of our friend group (WhatsApp) a friend of mine added me again and kicked her out.

One thing about this guy— he ordered everything he needed off of a delivery app. Never went to the grocery store for himself, even for dog food. 
Recently, about a month after we’ve broken up, he charged $35 to my credit card via this delivery app, since my card was saved as a payment method from when we were together. I’m not working right now (which he knows), so the money was a low-blow for no reason. He had me blocked on every possible form of communication, so there was no way for me to contact him and ask for the money. Luckily, I was able to report fraud and did not have to pay for anything he bought. 
Here’s the revenge:
A quick email to the delivery app’s customer service with his name, address, and phone number along with a description of what happened. The app could see that the purchase was returned to my card because of fraud. I got an email back saying that they have blacklisted his account, meaning he is no longer able to log in or make purchases.

2019-05-11 05:36:38+00:00,3704,"Got fired from a freight company, delivered my revenge.",aloecera,"So, a few years back, I was working as a logistics coordinator for a large freight company (I'm a freight I can't tell you which). The conditions were largely, in my opinion, horrible. Got treated as filth.

One day, my boss pulled me into the office to tell me that I was gonna be fired and my last day at the company would be a month from that date. Her motivation was that I wasn't showing any development within my role in the company. (I was never allowed to take my own initiatives, work in my own way or anything so I found it difficult to ""develop"". My numbers matched that of my peers)

Anyway, this gave me the unbearable urge for revenge.

I should add here, that none of the employed there seemed to know the first thing about servers, computers, mail systems (ironic if I could tell you which company it was) or anything related to tech in general.

This left room for the perfect ""innocent"" crime. (I didn't want to go too far, but I was frankly quite petty)

So, I set up an autoreply on my work email which would only activate when my user in their system was offline (in other words, when I wasn't there anymore). This would essentially send the original sender a pre-written email everytime they sent out emails. Let's just put it simply; I was in *a lot* of mailing lists due to my position.

My autoreply was something along the lines of;

""Hi, this is Aloecera. I can unfortunately not reply to your email currently as my boss, ***** has ordered me to head to the fields and pick cherries. 

If your matter is urgent, please contact her, or one of the others in her position. 

Best wishes, 

Aloecera""

My last month in the company rolled by swiftly and the last day came and went. Now my account was offline, the autoreply was activated and everything was in place.

The first few weeks went by silently. No one tried to contact me. I was getting worried that my petty revenge had failed. This was up until almost exactly a month later when my (now former) boss called my private number, with shaking voice, and said ""please... Come in and deactivate this shit.""

I did not deactivate it. I gave her intentionally poorly written instructions about how she could go by doing it herself. 

Here comes the cherry (another intended pun) of the cupcake;

Last week, I bought an assload of cherries and adressed it to the office. One former colleague called and thanked me. 

I guess he knew of my shenanigans.

Mrs. S clearly didn’t like children. But we had a card system (this is important) Everytime you misbehaved you would “flip your card” the order was (from best to worst) Green-Yellow-Orange-Blue-Purple-Red. Red meant detention. We also had a bathroom in our classroom. Ok onto the story

So basically we had just gotten back from Gym. Well the class did. I was in the nurse because I fell and hit my head on the hard floor. I had some ice and I came back to the class learning math. That’s when I started feeling Nauseous. I raised my hand and asked for some water. Ms. S was a little upset. Since I was pretty shy I didn’t ask again because I felt like I was annoying her. But I was “disrupting” the class because I started rocking back in forth to calm my stomach. Ms. S said Flip your card to yellow and go to time out. I sat in the back desk and started feeling worse. I started crying because I rarely got in trouble. FYI do NOT cry when you feel like you’re gonna vomit. I asked to use the bathroom in the classroom because A) I could feel the storm and B) I thought I might need to collect myself in the bathroom. Ms. S was LIVID. She said “Go to the bathroom but first flip your card to orange”. I flipped my card and ran to the bathroom. I sat on the toilet (clothed) and the vomit came. It. WAS. EVERYWHERE.

This teacher would yell to the point where other classrooms would send kids down to our room and ask our teacher to quiet down. It even escalated to the point where the teacher in the class bordering ours had to buy a small microphone (she was a quiet person by nature) to be heard. 

Anyway, this particular story happened around the middle of the year. The flu was spreading around the school, and none of us second graders had any concept of hygiene. So the flu spread like the plague. Naturally, kids had to go to the bathroom a lot during flu season. But my teacher didn't allow students to go to the bathroom for any reason while she was teaching, and she made us wait for snack or lunch break. 

So you can probably see where this is going. In the middle of one of our lessons, I felt a little queasy. I raised my hand and asked if I could get my water bottle. (All the water bottles were kept in the back so kids didn't tip them over.) Since I didn't have to leave the room, my teacher let me get a drink. Then two minutes later, I felt queasy again, so I asked if I could get another drink. My teacher let me, but she was visibly annoyed.

Then, less than a minute later, I got that feeling. I was going to vomit. So I raised my hand yet again, hoping desperately she would call on me. I knew she saw my fist in the air, because she made brief eye contact before turning around to face the board so she wouldn't have to deal with it. 

I took a deep breath. Then another. But nothing was stopping the shitstorm that was brewing in my stomach. So I did what any sensible second grader would do--I opened my mouth and vomited across three desks. The foul liquid that exited my bowels was a mixture of fruit snacks, apple juice, and whatever other brightly colored things I had eaten that day. My teacher turned around and died a little on the inside; even my second-grade self could see that. She, being a mean person, made me carry the trash can down to the nurse with me.

In my second year of university in the UK I entered a house share with four other girls that I'd never met before. Two rooms were on the ground floor next to the living room and then there were three rooms upstairs. Myself and J were on the ground, D, O and G were on the top floor.

Generally we all got along okay and were respectful of each other's time tables and habits. I had a part time job that meant some very early mornings and all the girls tried not to wake me during those shifts apart from one, D. D had the room directly above mine and never seemed to understand that the walls were paper thin and I could hear her shitty music late at night or her late night entrances stumbling through the front door with her boyfriend despite me trying often to respectfully ask her to keep it down. It got to the point where we basically ignored each other.

Skip ahead to exam times. We all got together and created a time table to be put on the fridge of who had exams and when so we could try not to wake anyone who had one the next day. D, J and G all finished their exams the day before my final one and planned to go out to celebrate. I said fine but please stick to the agreement of being quiet when they got back home. 

J and G came back around 1am apparently but I never heard them as they remembered I had an exam at 9am and so kept it quiet. D on the other hand staggered into the living room with whom I assumed to be her boyfriend, screeching with laughter. This was about 2.30am and funnily enough woke me up.

Now I'm awake but worried about the exam so I just lay in bed and tried to go back to sleep. I heard them go into D's room and start chatting. I sent her a text reminding her of my exam and asking her to please keep it down. Apparently she took this as a sign to start having obnoxiously loud sex.

This infuriated me. I'm not the kind of person that functions well without sleep. I grabbed my half drunk cold cup of tea by my bed and went upstairs to knock on her door to ask her to stop. She had not closed the door and so it swings open to her being done doggy style by a guy who was clearly not her boyfriend. I chucked the cold tea over the both of them and screamed ""Keep it down, I have a fucking exam in the morning!"" before storming back to my room.

The petty part? Not only did her new friend leave immediately but I then texted her boyfriend to let him know D was cheating on him. The guy from the club proceeded to spread the story across the university and she became known as ""Teabag Girl"" for the rest of her time at university.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bky2r4/keep_me_up_the_night_before_my_final_exam_you/,pettyrevenge,47,0.0

B: *speaks louder* what. Will. It. Beee?

W: *points at the beer she wants*

B: ""I don't understand you. What do you want?!""

Woman, obviously getting distressed and embarrassed, shakes her head and reaches for her bag. Picks up a pen and a napkin and writes something down.

B: *yelling* ""I don't have fucking time for this""

He walks back to us and asks us what we want. My friend took the lead and ordered a single beer and some fries. We are all a bit pissed at what we just witnessed and walk away with to leave, asking her not to order. She gives us this ""follow my lead look"" and pays. She then walks to the deaf woman and talks with her for a bit (she speaks sign language). She then promptly walked to our table and asked us not to touch the beer. The fries show up and she asks us not to touch them either. She waits until the lady leaves (she packed her things and left without ordering) and then pours one beer over the fries, takes them to the bar and dumps them on the bar, fries and beer all over the place.

The bartender is obviously furious but without skipping a beat my friend looks at him and answers in sign language: ""I don't understand, what do you want?""

We all laughed walking out. Obviously the bartender didn't understand shit, but it felt like a good revenge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bk8uhj/yell_at_a_deaf_person_enjoy_cleaning_up/,pettyrevenge,104,0.0

I get inside and right when the door closes a hand pushes through. She looked like your typical middle-aged Karen.  

She presses the 17th floor and she takes one look at my floor, which was on the 2nd. She scoffs, glares at me and says, ""The second floor? Really?""

Didn't take much to piss me off. Her comment was so unnecessary and uncalled for. Who cares if it was the second floor? It's my decision whether to take the stairs or not. I just finished an overnight shift and I was exhausted. 

I guess my exhaustion made me extra moody because when I reached my floor she was scrolling through her phone. I quickly run my hands through as much buttons as I could and said, ""Have fun, bitch"" right when the door closes. 

And because I was extra exhausted, therefore, extra moody and petty, I pressed the up button when the elevator barely reached the 3rd floor so I can use the other elevator and press a bunch of buttons again to further inconvenience her just in case she decided to get off on the 3rd floor to take the other elevator. Take the stairs then if it's not that big of a deal.

Just don't be fucking rude to your neighbors for riding the elevators to the 2nd floor. You don't know if they're exhausted or if they have non-visible health conditions that make it hard for them to take the stairs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bjjqbm/since_you_wanna_judge_me_for_taking_the_2nd/,pettyrevenge,581,0.0
2019-05-01 03:11:38+00:00,3534,Make fun of me for being abused as a kid? Enjoy getting catfished.,throwaway3209850,"A couple of weeks ago I met a guy on the r4r sub. We got to know each other for a day or two and things seemed to be going well. He said early on that women tended to ghost him after a couple of days and I said that, if he'd want me to, I would tell him why I was going to stop talking if it ever came to that, so he wouldn't have to wonder. He seemed very grateful and said he'd appreciate that.
&amp;nbsp;

So he said he wanted to send me a dick pic and I politely declined on the grounds that we really didn't know each other yet and dick pics don't typically turn me on anyway. He got butthurt and insisted because ""what if I don't like his body."" Okay. Fine. He sent it, I said nice and changed the subject. Now at this point I have already mentioned to him that I'm on disability for PTSD because of severe childhood trauma and rape (this is relevant later) but I let this go. He starts to talk nonstop about sex and I nicely ask if he can tone down the sex for now because we really don't know each other. He says sure, then immediately goes back to sex talk. 
&amp;nsbp;

So I'm done. He's pushed my boundaries consistently and ignored my discomfort and I'm starting to feel like he's trying to bully me into sexual interaction. But because I said I'd tell him before I ghosted him, I try to find the most tactful and polite way of explaining that he has ignored my feelings too many times and I'm no longer interested in potentially meeting him. He goes ballistic.
&amp;bnsp;

He starts making fun of me for being a molestation and rape victim, saying I'm ugly, telling me I'm worthless to society because of my PTSD and no one will ever want me. Any cruel, hurtful thing you can think of, he says it. It genuinely hurt my feelings and made me feel bad about myself. Then one hour later he posts on R4R again, saying he's a sweet, caring person that's just looking for someone to take care of and support. Queue petty revenge.
&amp;nbsp;

I set up a fake profile, get some fake pics ready, and message him. I pretend to be a student in the major he got his degree in. I'm fascinated by everything he says, I can't wait to meet him. When he finally asks me out, I of course, say yes. Over text, I encourage him to buy the movie tickets ahead of time and wait outside for me. Then I say I've pulled up and ask what he's wearing. He describes it and I say ""Oh.."" He says ""What's that supposed to mean?"" And I respond ""Sorry. I thought you were cute.""

We moved into a new cookie cutter neighborhood and since then,  we have been bothered by pest control,  carpet cleaners, lawn care, solar panel firms,  etc. This was multiple times a day at first but then we put up a no soliciting sign and for a while,  it worked pretty well.

Fast forward to this week, salespeople have rang my doorbell daily despite my sign. I started by chewing them out and finding their business online to leave bad Yelp reviews. Then I researched city ordinances. Apparently they need a permit which most don't have and they can't ignore a no soliciting sign. Its 250$ per violation - awesome.

Had my first victim yesterday who acknowledged he read my sign but thought his info about solar panels was something I'd want to hear even though I specifically had a sign because I didn't want to be bothered. I chewed him out and when he left,  called police non emergency number.

The police came after only 15 minutes and caught up with him down the street. I don't know if he was cited but he just sat on the curb after the police left,  probably because they told him to stop knocking on doors period, due to a lack of permit.

P.S. sorry for any formatting issues, I am submitting this via mobile

I work as a line cook at a concession stand. Normally the people I work with are pretty cool, but they decided to be dicks the other day while I was working. I had a drink out that I poured from the fountain pop machine, and left it unattended for a short period of time while I went into the back kitchen. When I came back out front, I took a drink, only to discover that somebody had poured a vinegar packet into it.

I was pissed. And decided ""welp, not being nice to these guys today"", and made it known among the staff that I didn't take too kindly to being pranked like that. I learned who had soiled my drink with vinegar, we'll call him Bitch Boy, and decided to make burgers for everyone else except him. When he asked if I was making him one, I said ""Nope"" and continued cooking.

He started talking shit, as Bitch Boy tends to do, and decided to cook himself his own burger. He left to take care of something in the back, and left his freshly cooked burger unattended. To my credit, I didn't do anything to it, but when he came back, he scarfed down the burger and then looked at me. He realized he'd left it unattended around me, and asked me if I'd done anything to it.

I just laughed,

He asked me again, ""For real, op, did you do anything to it?""

I just laughed more.

He started to panic. He said he started to feel queasy, and rushed to the washroom, while I kept laughing.

He eventually left early because he was sick.

The drive thru was designed to have two entry lanes so two orders can be taken at the same time, then the lanes merge into a single lane before it reaches the drive thru windows.

Me and another lady arrived at the same time but I finished my order way before she did. I pull forward to where the two lanes are about to merge and I wait because there’s a car in front. A few minutes later, the lady finishes her order and arrives at the merge as well. When the car in front moved forward a little bit, this lady wedges her way into the merge to where I am forced to let her in first. I look to her to give her the stink eye but she’s looking forward completely ignoring me, pretending that she didn’t just cut me off.

Here’s the revenge. The single lane takes a left turn, almost like a U-turn before it reaches the window so instead of following right behind the lady, I stay put. I wait until her car and my car are perpendicular to each other and then bam! I turn my brights on. She’s stuck, she can’t move forward and she just has to take my lights shining right at her. I declared victory when she put down her sun visor.

2019-04-27 17:21:51+00:00,4585,Loud jerks get shut up by a child.,WigglyButtNugget,"So, this was just a quick thing that just happened and I felt like I should share it. 

Today, I'm babysitting this kid who is like a little brother to me. While he's ten years old, he has a super baby face and is short on top of that, so everyone thinks he's actually between 6-8 years old. He also knows all kinds of curse words, and knows when it's appropriate to say them. This is important for the story.

Today, we ate out at a nice, delicious restaurant. I brought my dog, so we could only eat outside in the small patio space, but it was still super nice; save for these super loud three men. 

Now, to some people it wouldn't be a big deal what they were doing, but it was getting on my nerves. These guys weren't just loud, but rude, making huge scary noises that confused my dog, not to mention making comments about nipples, saying things like ""yeah, she's Asian so I love her"" and other completely inappropriate things, as well as smoking even though it was a no smoking area. And of course there was cursing as well, lots of it.

They didn't care about anyone else, and seemed oblivious to everyone around them. They were even making the kid I babysit uncomfortable. So, in a fit of annoyance, I told the kid that next time they cursed and every time after that, to ask, very loudly, what [insert curse word] meant.

The kid did, very loudly, the next time they cursed. The first time he did it, other people around us gave the guys dirty looks, finally fed up with their behavior. The guys quieted down, but not by much.

The second time they cursed, he did the same thing, and after someone told them to knock it off because there was a little kid here, they shut up completely, and we got to enjoy the rest of the meal in peace.

So yeah, it wasn't much of a revenge, but it made me happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bi1bvb/loud_jerks_get_shut_up_by_a_child/,pettyrevenge,128,0.0
2019-04-27 07:45:06+00:00,2057,Karen thinks her daughter deserves a solo more than the pastor's kid. Pastor's wife is in charge of the church choir.,LookOutForNargles03,"So, my dad is a preacher and my mom does Sunday School. Any other PKs will know that means I was never allowed to win judged contests at church, like pumpkin carving, if I found the golden egg at Easter, I had to put it back so someone else could get it, and I never got the solos in choir unless no one else wanted it, because my parents were afraid the other parents would think they were just giving me things I don't deserve, even if my pumpkin was the best or I was the only one who was even singing in choir. Afterward, my parents would always take me and my sister out for a treat if something like that happened, we just weren't recognized publicly.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thirteen or fourteen and we were working on a song for Easter that had some pretty low notes. There wasn't a solo, but my mom had me closest to the microphone since I was the only one who could hit the notes most of the time and they pointed the speakers back at us so the others could hear me and hopefully adjust their pitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

Karen's daughter was a little younger than me and she could sing nice, but she was a high soprano and couldn't hit the lower notes. (She had gotten not one, but two solos in the Christmas play. One during one of the songs with everyone else, the other was her singing alone while I played the piano. During our song, you could barely hear her, she was off key, and off-tempo with my playing because she refused to take the music home with her to practice.)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Karen walks in and watches for the rest of the rehearsal. After a bit, when Mom thinks everyone's got the hang of it, she has me move to my normal spot (In the back middle so everyone could hear me during the actual performance. This tends to happen often with young country kids with little to no singing experience) and we continue as normal. Karen's daughter is about two people to the left of the mic and still isn't able to hit the low notes, but everyone else is doing okay. We've got one more rehearsal before we have to sing this in church, so we should be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't there for this part, but apparently, Karen approached my mom after and asked why I had the solo and not her daughter who was oBvIoUsLy way more talented than me. Mom explained that I didn't have a solo, that there wasn't even a solo for this song, and that I was just singing into the mic so everyone else could get the hang of the song. Karen asked why she didn't have her daughter sing into the mic because she's a better singer than me. Now, I don't claim to be an amazing singer, but I've been in several choirs that I've gotten solos in. I usually get picked for the short solos entitled kids think they're too good for or the director hears me during rehearsal and realizes I'm the only one actually changing the way I sing when he gives constructive criticism and rewards me with the only solo during the Veteran's Day program. Love ya, Mr. C. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, I'm not a bad singer. My mom explains that Karens daughter couldn't hit the lower notes and was struggling with this song. I just want to reiterate that this was a week and a half before we have to sing in church. There is one more rehearsal left. 

&amp;#x200B;

Karen: Well, then just have them do a song \[daughter\] can sing. You can't have them do hard songs just so \[my name\] can feel better about herself.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom, being the good pastor's wife she is, calmly tells her that the songs were actually picked out by Karen's MOTHER, that the kids have already learned the song, and that Karen is welcome to take the CD home with her so her daughter can practice. Karen gets mad and tells her to just give her daughter a full song like she did at Christmas. My mom explains that the only reason her daughter had THAT solo was that a lot of people wanted ME to play the piano since they had never heard me play and I didn't want to do it myself because I was afraid people would think I was getting special treatment for being the pastor's kid. Not such an irrational fear now, huh Dad?

&amp;#x200B;

**Karen**: \*scoffs\* If she can't even play that silly song alone, why did you give her the solo? Singing is way harder than piano and she shouldn't have the solo if she has stage fright

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is mad at this point and again explains that I didn't have the solo for Easter, that it was only for today's rehearsal, and that I didn't have stage fright. There weren't any solos for the Easter songs and the daughter wouldn't be able to learn it in time at this point. Everyone else is gathering in the sanctuary to do the benediction, so Karen shuts up for the time being. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next week, the daughter comes in with some song lyrics and says her mom wants her to sing it on Sunday. This was Thursday. I'm looking over her shoulder and, not knowing what had happened last week, I mention that I think that song is in my piano book. Since we go straight from my piano lessons to church, I look and I do have it! Since Karen hadn't sent a CD, my mom just smiles and tells the daughter that she can sing it and I would play the piano with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I run through it alone a few times while everyone else is eating dinner, and then we go through it together after we had gone through all the other songs. Karen comes in and sees us rehearsing together and starts talking loudly to my mom, which makes me mess up, having learned this song in about ten minutes. I stop and Karen starts saying that her daughter DESERVED a solo to herself and shouldn't have to share the spotlight with a spoiled brat who can't even play. My mom calmly points out the obvious that Karen distracted me and that I was doing very well considering how fast I had learned the song. She then tells me and the daughter to run through it again.

&amp;#x200B;

As we do, the grandmother walks in and comments on how she was excited to hear me play again and that we sounded amazing. If you've ever met a southern mom, you know you don't get mad at someone else when your mom's in the room unless you're 110% sure she will side with you. Karen backed off, and pouted for the rest of the night. Her daughter was supposed to be staying with one of the other church kids that night since we were out of school the next day for Good Friday. Which means Karen left at the same time as her mother and couldn't say anything about it. Easter Sunday comes and the same thing that occurred at Christmas happened. I had practiced nonstop for two days so I would be perfect and Karen's daughter sounded like she hadn't practiced since Thursday. Which she probably hadn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that, during the group songs,  the microphone was a lot closer to us than usual, which meant, instead of everyone being about the same distance from the mic, I was about six inches to a foot closer than everyone else. I listened to someone's recording later and you could hear me ever so slightly louder than everyone else. I'm 99% sure that was on purpose.

Yay!

So a little backstory
I’m a bus driver (Duh) I’m sitting in the bus station of a major city in the UK, waiting to pick up passengers. Around 12 people in total. This bus route goes a little bit out of the way so it’s never too busy and is the only bus that happens to go to certain cities. I used to work in Childcare and the Hotel industry, So I’m pretty used to dealing with people.

Cast:

Me: That bus driver person who always looks miserable but is really just paying attention to the road
AP: Asshole Passenger

Ap: *boards on her phone. She is a middle aged woman in very expensive garb and idiotic sunglasses. She continues her conversation a little bit whilst I watch her before addressing me swiftly and angrily* 
Does this bus go to [Asshole road] in [Wankerville]?!

Me: We go to [Wankerville] Mam, but not [Asshole road] You would have to walk about ten minutes to get there

Ap: Urgh. Fine. How much?!

Me: Would you like a single or a return Mam?

Ap: A return obviously. Does it look like I’m going to walk there!

Me: Alright. One return to [Wankerville]. 4.20 please

She pays with a 20, making sure to pull out a five and then the 20 after and pays for the ticket.
It’s worth noting that [Wankerville] is in the Zone A area, along with this city. But this bus goes all the way to [Potatoland] Which is in the Zone B area. She has a Zone A ticket. This is important later to the pettiness.

Ap: *she takes her ticket and huffs, whilst counting her change out in case I “Short change” her* Tell me when we reach [Wankerville] Because I don’t know where it is!

Me: As long as I remember Mam.

She sits down in a huff and I depart. When people ask me to let them know when we reach somewhere, I always respond with “As long as I remember” as this gives me some cover in case I forget. Because we do legitimately forget.

As I’m driving along the bus route, I can hear her loudly complaining on the phone about how “It smells in here” And how she’s on a “Peasant wagon” (Yes really) And other obnoxious things. She makes comment about me and other passengers. It’s annoying but happens. Not much to be done.

We reach the outskirts of [Wankerville] and I’m totally fed up with this woman. So I decide a little bit of petty revenge is in order

Wankerville is a tiny hamlet. Maybe 30 houses along a short strech of road. Very easy to miss.
And so I miss it.

I continue driving, another 30 minutes to an area that is in the Zone B area just after the other bus passes me coming the other way. Then I audible “Gasp” and come to a stop at a bus stop

Me: Mam?

Ap: What?! Are we here

Me: Mam. I’m so sorry, but I forgot that you wished to get off at [Wankerville] And we have gone past it

AP: WHAT?! HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID! 
She then came up to the front of the bus as I opened the doors, berating me. I sat there and remained quiet for awhile, before doing the “Customer Service” Thing (You know what I mean)

Me I’m so sorry Mam. If you hop off here and wait at the stop across the road, a bus will be with you shortly to take you back to [Wankerville]

AP cusses at me some more and proclaims she “Will be speaking to the CEO about this!” Yea good luck with that. Before getting off and going across the road, to the unsheltered bus stop in the middle of nowhere.

With no mobile signal, An hour at Minimum wait and a ticket that won’t get her back on the bus. (I pick my spots well)


I drove off and went home. And Now I'm sitting at a PC writing this up. I can only hope she was still out there when the rain started.

Aint life wonderful?

2019-04-23 08:32:50+00:00,3802,Block a seat? Miss the stop.,Zuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuul,"I live in a small European county where public transport is the easiest and most convenient option to get from A to B. The trams in my city have a variety of seats. Single seats, seats for two and seats for four (two seats facing each other). 

I have noticed that in the past few years, people have come up with the most annoying habit to sit on the seat on the aisle seat, and leave the window seat free. This always annoys me, especially when the opposite two seats are occupied. So when you want to sit, you have to climb over people. 

Last week, during rush hour, I entered a tram and there was only one seat left. It was a window seat (of course) but it wasn't really free. The guy on the aisle seat had his backpack on the seat next to him. People have their stuff on the seats all the time, but usually move it when the tram starts to get full. Every decent person would do that, right? Well not this guy. So I walked up to him and looked at him with my most judgmental expression. My coworkers tell me all the time, that I'm extremely good at making them feel guilty by just looking at them. But it didn't work with this guy. He chose to ignore me. Usually I don't have a problem with telling people how stupid they are, but I didn't say anything. I'm not sure why. I just stood there, blocking the aisle, and staring at him. 

Two stops after I got in, he wanted to get out. Now I was still there, in the aisle and blocking it. He grabbed his backpack, stood up and looked at me. I noticed it and...... chose to ignore him. A few seconds of him staring at me and me ignoring him passed before he said ""excuse me?"" and I moved so he could pass. 

The thing is, the tram doesn't stop for very long. Usually, especially during rush hour, people make their way to the doors even before the tram stops. But this guy didn't. I can only guess he wanted to have his backpack enjoy the experience of blocking a seat until the very last moment. He only got up after the tram stopped and then had to have me ""excuse him"" so that when he arrived at the doors, they were already locked.

About a third of the way there, we got stuck behind a car going way below the speed limit, and typically it was in spots we couldn’t over take. 100km/h, they are doing 80. 80km/h limit, they are doing 60. Extremely annoying. So we get into town to go to the grocery store, we are right near the entrance, blinkers on to turn left, they are in front of us ready to go forward and suddenly they just hard left into the car park, no blinkers, forcing us to slam on the brakes with baby in the back. Needless to say, me and SO who was driving are extremely pissed after being stuck behind them for 10 minutes.

I watched them park up while we were, and get out of the car. I identified them while we unloaded LO and put her in her stroller. I said to SO “every chance I get In the store, I am stopping in front of them with the shopping cart, hard”. 

I got 3 opportunities to get in their way and by golly I took them. Just meandering through the aisles, very slowly, veering one side to the other, stopping suddenly in front of them and not noticing when they were trying to get past. 

Sooooo satisfying that I did not feel one ounce of guilt!",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bg0xbs/drive_20kmh_below_the_speed_limit_and_then/,pettyrevenge,235,0.0
2019-04-20 23:39:19+00:00,3220,[NSFW] Keep bumping me in line? Enjoy my farts.,funduk_kabir,"This happened quite some time ago.  I was at Disneyland with my wife.  We stopped in that ice-cream shop on Main Street USA to have ourselves an ice-cream.  Like everywhere else at Disneyland, there was a long, long line.  When we got in the line, two ladies with three kids got in line behind us.  One woman (the mother?) was in her 30s, I guess.  The other one was older, so maybe an aunt or the grandmother, or whatever.  The three kids were of different ages.  I’m not sure they were all sisters, but it seemed like that was the case.  At any rate, they all seemed to be at the youngest, maybe seven, and at the oldest eight or nine.  

Like all lines at Disneyland, this one had it’s moments.  Sometimes, it would move a lot in a short time.  Other times, it would be frozen for what seemed like a long time.  The first time this line moved in front of us, though, these three girls zipped right around my wife and me and got directly behind the people in front of us.  They were so quick with it that they actually bumped into the back of the people in front of us and those two people (another couple) turned around and looked at my wife and me with an inquisitive look, like they thought these were our kids.  

I just shook my head, and looked back at the two ladies behind us, who only then started to say something to the girls.  “Come on.  Where are you going?  Get back here!”  

The girls had this defeated look and reluctantly moved back toward the two women.  At that point, my wife and I moved up in the line.  Meanwhile, these three girls were moving around back there, and since my wife was in front of me, the three girls kept bumping into me.  I have to admit, I really don’t like people bumping into me.  It’s pretty annoying, but I also have to take into account that it’s three little girls who just aren’t very patient.  

The next time the line moved, the three girls zipped around us again.  This time, one of them even bumped into me as she was passing us.  Again, they butted up against the people in front of us and it was pretty much a repeat of the first time, but this time, the two women were slower to call the three girls back.  

This happened at least one more time, until eventually, the mom tells the girls that if they can’t behave in the line, she wasn’t going to get them any ice-cream, so the girls go back to being behind my wife and me.  The next time the line moved, the girls didn’t zip around us.  Instead, they stayed behind us.  My wife wasn’t paying much attention, and the line moved up by a few feet, so one of the girls said, “Go!  Come on!”  

I thought this was kind of funny, but I was still a little annoyed because the girls kept bumping into me.  Sure, it’s annoying, but I also felt like I couldn’t move very much for fear of stepping on a foot or accidentally reaching back and hitting one of them in the head or some other similar mishap.  

When my wife finally moved up in line, I followed close behind, but the girls were right on my tail.  One of them was even stepping up close to the back of my feet.  Every time I moved a little, she’d move up a bit, too.  It even got to the point that she was right behind me and kept butting up against my heels like it was a game with her.  It was like she was showing her mom that she was behaving by not passing us, but at the same time, she was going to be as close behind us as she possibly could.  The other two girls were pretty much right along with her.  They’re also saying things like what flavors they want and what they want, but every time the mom would say something, one of them would talk about how they wanted ice-cream.  

As we wound through the ropes that marked out the boundaries of the line, these girls were right on my heels.  I couldn’t even lift my foot to move forward without one of them sticking a toe under there, so I was kind of sliding forward as I went.  At one point, I looked back behind me at the two women.  The mom looked back at me with a kind of shrug which said to me that she realized what was going on, but she wasn’t going to do anything about it.  I would have said something at this point, but that would have just started a fight with my wife.  She’s the kind of person who automatically acted like I was wrong about everything and speaking up for myself in public was sure to get her pissed off at me, so I figured, “fuck it” and figured I’d wait it out.  

We were starting to get close to the front of the line.  I figured we had about five to 10 minutes before we got to where we could place our order.  And that ice-cream smelled really good.  The whole store smelled like chocolate fudge and waffle cones.  I was looking forward to getting that ice-cream, but at the same time, I was looking forward to getting out of that line and getting those kids off my back.  

Around this time, the three girls were getting really impatient and they started arguing about which one of them was going to be first in line, so they started a shoving match and kept bumping up against me.  I moved as close to my wife as I could, but these girls kept bumping me.  Meanwhile, the two women did nothing.  I looked at the mom.  She didn’t even seem to notice me looking at her.  The other woman then tells the girls to calm down with their fighting or no ice-cream.  

They stopped shoving each other, but then all stood there smooshed up against me and every time I moved forward, they would smash up close to me again.  Then, when we were on the final turn just before getting up to place our order, with these girls right on my heels, I kind of felt a little rumbly in my tumbly and I thought of the prospect of being able to blast some noxious gases out on these girls, wondering if that would get them off my back.  As luck would have it, I only managed to squeak out a little plooper that neither smelled or made an alarming odor.  

But then, without warning, I was able to blast out a pretty good dook.  I was pleased at this one that made kind of machine-gun rattle with a whistler at the end.  It was like, “Ba-da-dap.  Pah-wheeeet!”  I almost laughed.  My wife looked back at me.  For a second, I thought she’d heard it, but she has bad hearing in one ear and it was kind of loud in that shop.  

The three girls heard it.  They stopped their wiggling around and when I moved forward a little bit, they stayed put, looking up at me with what could only be a mixture of disbelief and disgust.  I looked down at them and smiled.  The line moved forward, and for the first time in a good 10 minutes, I didn’t have little feet stepping on my heels or little faces pressing against my backside.  

The mom took notice that the girls weren’t moving forward.  “Go ahead.  Don’t you want ice-cream?”  I looked back.  One of them was shaking her head.  

Then I smelled it.  It was as nasty as it had been loud.  And for me to have heard it in that loud place, it must have been pretty good, but that fart was really rank. I was admiring my handiwork, both at having farted and at having gotten those girls off my back.  That’s when my wife looked at me with that evil look she gets when she’s about to accuse me of something.  I acted like I didn’t notice.  

“You’re disgusting!”  She said, and accused me of the fart.  

“Yeah, you always say that…” I said, then stopped and made a face, like I’d just discovered the terrible aroma.  

“Bullshit!”  My wife said.  “You always say it wasn’t you.”  

“Right, right,” I said, waving my hand in front of my face.  “Damn!  Someone has no home training!  That’s nasty.”  I looked at my wife.  “But, when it’s me, I can’t stop laughing, right?”  

The girls were still cowering against the mom and looking in my direction.  “What’s wrong?”  The mom asked.  The girl raised a finger like she was trying to point at me.  

“I think maybe one of them pooped herself,” I said.  

“No, no,” the woman said.  “They’re potty-trained.”  

“Yeah, okay,” I said, “But…” then waived my hand in front of my face again and pointed at the girl.  “You should probably check her.  I can still smell it.”  

When my wife and I got up to the counter, I looked back again and the two women and the girls were exiting the line.

2019-04-20 14:16:10+00:00,2064,"Called me pregnant when I was 13, got punched in the face 8 years later",green__aubergine,"So. When I was an awkward pre-teen, I was a little chubbier than the other girls and had big frizzy hair (Greek girl problems), and it was safe to say I felt like the odd one out. One afternoon, I attended a school sporting event, and I was minding my own business when this guy who I knew from my class came up to me and started mumbling stuff. Out of nowhere he goes “what, are you pregnant?” That shit hit me like a brick. I never forgot about it the rest of high school, I eventually got over it but little things like that rock your world when you’re trying to figure life out and everything. 

Fast forward probably like 8 years later. I don’t have issues anymore with my body or self, love me or hate me, irdc. I’ve now found my other half, who completely fills in my life like my puzzle piece. He was raised by his single mother who taught her kids that bullying is a strict no-go. His lack of social unsureness never ceases to amaze me. 

It was a normal night out with friends, bar hopping and drinking too many Red Bull snorkels. Around bar time, our friends left the last bar early to get in line at the pizza place. We followed them shortly after, but instead of finding them safely waiting at the restaurant, we see them engaging in some sort of tussle around the corner. We walk up, and assuming it was some drunk misunderstanding, and try to separate our friends with the opposing parties. 

Right when we get there, I recognize the guy they are yelling back and forth with as the same guy who called me pregnant freshman year of high school. I am positioned directly in front of this guy as my boyfriend and I attempt to back our friends away, when out of nowhere I see one of my girlfriends little fist pop into the frame and smack this guy in the jawbone (she’s fiery). Him, being the dumbass he is, looked down and saw me in front of him, and (i assume) he thought it was actually ME who smacked him. He instantly draws his own fist back and aims towards my face, as if to punch me in the face in return. 

My boyfriend knows I am not a fighter. I have had dreams about getting in a fight and having to punch someone but my arms turn into jelly. After he sees this guy about to attack me, he instantly punches the guy in the face, and knocks him out into the street. I’ll never forget his fall back and how his hat dramatically bounced off into the middle of the road. It was great. 

We all ran off, still got pizza lol, and discussed. It turns out the guy had approached our friends and started calling one of our guy friends there the n-word, and all of them were defending him, cause that shit isn’t cool. My friend of course should not have hit him first, we could have just all walked away. My bf actually ended up breaking a pinky bone since he was caught so off guard lol and had to wear a brace for like a month. But that’s pretty much my biggest epic petty revenge story that I’ll never forget. 

TLDR: guy called me pregnant when I was a chubby preteen, then 8 years later was racist to my friends and tried to punch me, so my boyfriend knocked him out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bfcmod/called_me_pregnant_when_i_was_13_got_punched_in/,pettyrevenge,61,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years after it ended, my former sister in law was working at a big store that rhymes will Tall Fart.  My mom was going to have a barbecue and I was buying a couple bottles of Arbor Mist.  Don't judge me - I love that stuff.  Well, I was going through self checkout since all the lanes were packed.  Small town - this big store was really the only place to shop.  Apparently my former sister in law was running the self checkout and decided that due to our history, she couldn't be the one to check my ID.  I noticed her talking to another employee who came over to allow us to continue checking out, as the machine won't allow you to continue unless someone enters a code verifying that I was old enough to make the purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I got an e-mail from my ex-husband.  ""I think it's about time we got this divorce finalized so you can buy alcohol on your own.""

&amp;#x200B;

This made me feel very uncomfortable.  I didn't like him knowing what I purchased; the years of emotional abuse left me not wanting anything to do with him and I didn't feel like he had a right to know anything about my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I e-mailed the store with my complaint, explaining that my ex had spent years tearing me down and trying to break me and I felt like my ex was using the knowledge of my purchases to harass me and to let me know that he still knew what I was doing and who I was with.  I said that I felt it was inappropriate for my former sister in law to be informing him of what I bought.

\- I share a room.

\- I eat exclusively in the kitchen table (the only table we own).

\- My roommate eats exclusively in our room.

Every single time after cooking, I start eating in the kitchen table. As long as I'm cooking and for a couple minutes right after, I have the kitchen fan on. That fan is actually super, super loud, so I don't like having it on after I'm done cooking and I start eating.

95% of the time, my roommate will come out of the room and turn it back on and keep it back on for half an hour, so I have to deal with that super loud noise while I eat. I assume he's sensitive to smells (normally, I have chicken or beef).

The other day, I took my plate of food and started eating in my room. And he asked if I could eat outside!! Even though he eats there every day! I told him I didn't want to eat with the noise, and kept eating in the room.

2019-04-16 18:52:50+00:00,6745,Rude to my wife? Enjoy your moment of self doubt,ImJustAWannabe,"A few years ago when moving houses, we had to sell our Ikea PAX wardrobe as it wouldn't fit in our new place. This thing was massive, and took hours to originally build. My wife diligently took photos of it open/closed at different angles and advertised it as for sale online. Soon after we had a winning bidder, and for a pretty decent price too! We arranged a pickup date and all seemed to be going smoothly. 

A few days before the arranged pickup date the buyer dropped by unannounced and demanded to see the wardrobe right away or he wouldn't buy it. My wife was a bit flustered but let him anyways in and showed it to him. He did some measurements and after appearing to be satisfied with those, rudely told my wife that we'd better not damage it during disassembly, all screws and dowels etc be properly accounted for, that we tape all the long pieces together with cardboard in between them so they don't get scratched, and also that all the manuals are in decent condition and present so he can properly re-assemble everything. His behaviour made my wife feel nervous and attacked. He left without any thank for for your time or anything, just a threat that if all wasn't as he expected he'd not buy it.

So of course we took care dissembling the wardrobe and ensured pieces were separated by cardboard as to not get damaged. I also made sure all the manuals were present and accounted for. Lastly, I took great care to ensure that all screws and dowel were accounted for and in a sturdy plastic bag that wouldn't rip. 

However because he was an asshole to my wife, I took a screw from another Ikea furniture set we had dissembled during the move, and added it to the bag of screws and dowels for the wardrobe.

2019-04-15 09:51:24+00:00,11227,She tried to stop me from saving a man's life.,Nemoiimya,"I worked in an emergency room (ER) for 6 years so I am full of stories but when it comes to petty revenge this one sticks out in my memory.  

P= patient

PD= patient's daughter

CP= critical patient

me= me

Every person who has worked in the ER knows that Mondays are the busiest days of the week and also when all the crazies come out.  This day was no different.  I worked as a nurse in triage (where you initially get assessed in the front before going to the back).  Here we determine who needs to go back first and who can wait (it's NOT a first come first serve as most people think).  We had a few stretchers in the front for people who needed to be monitored a little closer or needed IV's, blood draws, labs,...  There were 6 stretchers but this day was so busy all 6 stretchers were filled plus 5 more in the hallway.  This lady comes in on an ambulance but because her symptoms did not indicate an emergency she was put in stretcher triage to wait her turn.  She was in a lot of pain.  After assessment I recognized her symptoms as being caused from gall stones (painful but not life threatening).  We put her on a stretcher, started an IV, drew labs, and hooked her up to the monitor just in case.  A few minutes later PD comes in the front door.  One look at her and we knew she would cause problems.  She had everything from the shoes to the haircut.  A classic rich Karen.  When she saw that her mom was still in the front and hadn't seen a doctor yet she started screaming that she knew the CEO of the hospital and that we would all be fired if we didn't get her mom back to see a doctor RIGHT NOW!  We explained that her mom has a history or gall stones and even P was saying that she has had this pain many times because of the gall stones.  We explained about being really busy and that there were no rooms available in the back and will get her back as soon as we could.  She eventually calmed down but was still antsy.  About an hour later another patient (CP) comes in and was put in the stretcher beside P and PD.  This patient had worrying complaints but on initial assessment we could not find anything wrong.  Now, as a nurse you learn to ALWAYS trust you gut.  When your gut sounds an alarm, you listen.  Something about this patient was setting my alarm bells off but all his vitals were normal and I had no solid evidence to declare him an emergency.  I hooked him up to the monitor and kept a very close eye on him.  I let the charge nurse know of my concerns and she said to let her know as soon as something changes.  Not 5 minutes later, something changed.  Now, at this time I should explain that this hospital was a level 1 trauma center, meaning we get all the bad cases from car crashes to gun shot victims (we were in the middle of gang territory).  Since we had to be ready for any traumas (life threatening injuries) we had a room with 3 beds that was closed off from the rest of the beds  because traumas usually involved a lot of people and a lot of blood.  Even on busy days like this one those rooms were empty unless there was a trauma patient.  Now, back to CP.  I was taking vital signs of P when I looked over to CP.  I noticed a worrying change in his rhythm and stopped with P to start assessing CP to see what was going on.  That did not sit well with PD.  She actually grabbed my arm and told me to finish with her mom.  I jerked my arm free and said I had to make sure CP was OK.  As I turned around to CP his rhythm went into V-vib (life threatening rhythm).  I called the charge nurse to inform her of CP condition all the while unhooking CP from the monitor  and throwing his bed into drive.  As I started pushing him back PD actually jumps in front of the stretcher and stops it.  She's screaming that her mom was here first and needed to be seen before CP and screaming that i was a liar and that she was going to get me fired.  I'm usually a mild temper person but knowing CP was literally minutes from dying and I said to PD ""you have a choice, get out of my way or get run over"" as I started pushing the stretcher forward.  Now, I'm really good at pushing stretcher's fast and getting the patient's where they needed to go in a hurry (one of the reasons I was part of the trauma team).  PD tried to stand firm but she saw I wasn't going to stop and jumped out of the way just as I was an inch from hitting her.  Unfortunately, she did not move fast enough and I ended up running over her foot.  At this point I didn't care and got the patient back to the trauma room leaving PD screaming lying on the floor.  We spent about 30 minutes on CP but he ended up dying.  By the time I got back up front P and PD had been taken to the back to see a doctor but my charge nurse warned me that they were filing a complaint against me.  A few days later the actual CEO of the hospital came to visit me on my next shift.  He was known to be a kind and fair man.  Since this happened during a time before cameras were put in the ERs he had to take what happened from word of mouth.  Apparently, PD said I assaulted her several times and put her mom's life in danger by not assessing her properly and that I should be fired.  Turned out that P did actually have gall stones and nothing else.  Also, PD's foot was broken due to me running over it.  I calmly explained exactly what happened and that PD's actions might of ended up in CP dying because of the delay she caused by her actions.  When I got to the part of what I said to PD and running over her foot the CEO actually started laughing and then tried to cover his mouth to hide his laughter.  He explained that PD was a friend of his sister and he knows what kind of person she is.  Not only did I not get fired he put a personal note in my file praising my actions.  On my next review I got a large raise + a bonus thanks to the CEO's note.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bde4q4/she_tried_to_stop_me_from_saving_a_mans_life/,pettyrevenge,365,0.0

I confronted her about it and she kept saying it was hers and that I just lost mine. Thankfully, there are duty teachers that go around the different syndicates to make sure nobody is hurt and to let students go when they finish eating. I told him about it and he said he'll deal with it at the cafeteria. A few minutes later, he came back and got me my money back. This wasn't enough, This girl just stole my lunch and money. So, I told the principal about it, she got suspended and I even got the news that this wasn't the first time she stole.

2019-04-11 21:47:29+00:00,6163,Good luck watching GOT this Sunday,girlwhoeatscake,"When I went home to California to take my mom to chemo, my (ex) boyfriend cheated on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

We tried to make it work, most likely because I couldn’t take any more life upheavals at that point. But come mid-November, it was over. I found my own apartment and moved out (we were living together). 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after we split I went to a concert with my ex since we purchased tickets 10 months prior. He, at some point, became malicious, telling me the name of the new girl he was seeing, telling me that I wouldn’t own a house before him because of my student loans and because he was living with his parents again. He told me I was mean and selfish, and that he downloaded dating apps before we split up. He finalized his monologue with ""Cheating on you was the best decision of my life."" Then he left me stranded at a bar with a dead phone and no way home. I haven’t talked to him since.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I know he's still signed into my HBO now account, but didn't really care. I kept thinking I'd reset the password and log out of all devices eventually, but never got around to it. Knowing that GOT is premiering this Sunday, I came to the realization that I would wait as long as possible before the premier to sign him out. So today, I signed out all devices on HBO and changed the password, so he can't watch the premier.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure he has friends that may watch it with him, but I know his parents don't have an HBO subscription, and because he lives at home with his parents, come Sunday night, he will find out he no longer has access to Game of Thrones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bc5n30/good_luck_watching_got_this_sunday/,pettyrevenge,311,0.0

My dad bought a new truck back in the 70's that 30 years later became my first car. It was ugly as shit and beat to hell but ran ok and because of its age was exempt from emissions testing so it was legally resgistered and everything. 

I almost always parked it in the garage when not driving it to school and back but had to park in the street for a couple days while using the garage for other stuff. A week later my parents got a letter from the HOA saying not to park outside because the truck was unsightly and brought down the neighborhood's value. We ignored it of course because they couldn't legally do anything about it. We saw the HOA president drive by our house multiple times taking pictures in her fancy new Range Rover and we'd get letters any time it sat outside for more than a day.

I did what any other sane person in my situation would do and started parking in the street every day. Although most of our neighbors were rich snobs and looked down on my parents for not buying me a brand new car, they never complained about my parking because they all hated the HOA nazi too and knew it pissed her off.

2019-04-09 07:25:03+00:00,4776,Won’t pay me back? Have fun paying all of a month’s rent.,haztea21,"This one’s my mom’s story. 

Many years ago, my mom was roommates with 5 people, including a lady (L) whose name was on the lease and her bratty son (BS). My mom, despite not having a good paying job, always made her rent every month and saved money on the side. 

For the most part, she got along with everyone, even going so far as to let the bratty son eat the food she bought, which by the way he always tried to sneak behind her back.

One day, L comes to my mom asking to borrow around $800, going down on her knees and crying about the terrible financial situation she was in. Well, mom was always the type to come to people’s aid, and with the promise of being paid the money back in the following month, she went ahead and lent L the money.

As you can guess, month after month passed and L never paid mom back, despite being continuously reminded. And of course it was always accompanied with some excuse, “I have to pay for BS’s school uniform, I don’t have enough money this month, etc etc”. Well mom knew she was lying out of her ass, because she would see L making long distance calls to her boyfriend overseas that would last hours, see L with new and unnecessary things, etc. obviously pointing to the fact that she had the money but didn’t prioritize paying mom back.

So, mom cooked up a plan. Since everyone gave their share of rent to L every month, my mom went to the other two roommates and informed them of the whole situation. They agreed to give their share of rent to my mom instead of L, leaving L with the responsibility of shouldering a whole month’s rent, which she would have no choice but to pay as the lease was in her name.

When L found out about this, she stormed over to my mom and demanded why she had done that. Cooly, she replied, “You owed me $800. I was just trying to get it back.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/bb4zhi/wont_pay_me_back_have_fun_paying_all_of_a_months/,pettyrevenge,80,0.0
2019-04-08 14:02:10+00:00,2800,"Your son doesn't like telemarketers? Well, now it's his fault you aren't saving money",JimmyL2014,"This happened a few years back. I was a telemarketer in the best telemarketing job you could get. I was basically calling old people who had been off contract for a year or so and getting them onto new plans that saved them money. It was really rewarding. They often got to save $20 or more per month, the company got 2 more years of contract, and I got paid. Everyone wins. 

Anyway, I called this little old lady. She used the internet occasionally, but not as much as her late husband. She didn't know much about the services as he normally handed the bills, and had just dutifully paid the bill each month. I looked at her account, and I immediately saw that she was paying waaay too much for her services. I told her as such and offered the best services based on her usage as I could. Ended up with a total savings of around $80 per month - which is a hell of a lot for anyone let alone a pensioner. After all the scripts had been read and I had entered the sales into processing, the old lady tearfully thanked me for saving her money and said that she was going to put the saved money aside for a holiday. 

Enter the son. He apparently freaked out when his mother told him about the sales call. He immediately assumed I had cheated his mother out of money and called my company raging about me. The sale got reversed (there was a 48 hour grace period before sales were final) and I lost out on a good commission. I was pissed. Not only had the son screwed me over, but he had also screwed his elderly mother out of money. It was then I began to form a plan to get back at him.

I spoke to my manager and explained what was going on, and convinced her to put a callback into the system to the old lady. I called the old lady and explained what happened. As soon as I began to explain that the order had been cancelled, she exploded about her son constantly sticking his nose where it didn't belong. She quickly agreed to my plan and called up her son on her mobile to get him to drive over immediately (he lived about 5 minutes away). 

I'll call the son S, the old lady OL, and me is me. 

OL: Hey S, the nice man from the other day is on the phone with me. Would you like to speak to him? 

S: Oh what the fuck is he calling back for? I told them not to call us back. 

OL: Well, he wants to speak to you, specifically. 

There's a moment where the phone is changing hands. 

S: What the hell do you want, mate? I told you lot to not call back. 

Me: Of course, but I wanted to be absolutely clear that you really wanted the order cancelled. 

S: Of course I want it cancelled. That's what I told you fuckers to do. 

Me: I appreciate where you are coming from, but could I please explain the changes I had pending in the system? 

S: Why? 

Me: Can I please just explain it? Then, if you don't want them, I won't bother you again. 

S: \*sigh\* Fine, go ahead. 

Me: Excellent. Well, your mother is paying $50 for her phone line before. She never makes STD calls, so I dropped the line to a plan without them. She can still make free local calls and the cost is down to $30 a month. The internet is currently $60 a month, and gives her 100GB of data, but, in the last 3 years she has never used more than 10GB per month, so, I dropped it down to 25GB per month and it's now $30 a month. On her mobile, she never uses the internet, and the plans are the same otherwise, so I dropped it down from $59 a month to $29 a month. 

S: Okay. 

Me: So, she was paying $169 a month, and would now pay $89 a month for all three services. 

S: So what stops me from going to a (company) shop and getting it done there? 

Me: Well, your mother said she struggles to get around, and she is the only one on the bill, so she would need to be there in person. I can get it done right now, no trouble. 

S: Well, I'll just call and...

OL: \*in background\* God damn it, S, would you stop being such an incalcitrant little prick and let the man do his job? He's going to save me some money and that's good enough for me. Quit giving him grief and let him do it already. 

S: Okay, okay. God damn it. 

OL: Good, now bugger off and stop causing me trouble. I might be old, but I'm not bloody senile, and you'd be best to remember that I'm your mum at the end of the day. \*pause\* Go on, get back to work. 

The phone is handed back to the old lady, and I hear a door slam in the background. The old lady busts out laughing, and we both end up laughing at him. She told me that it was great fun and it's a pity we can't do it again to make it stick. We had to do the scripts again, but she didn't mind, and at the end of the call told me that if I ever came through her town, to come and drop by for a cup of tea and a biscuit. 

She was a lovely old lady - most of them are. I left that job about 6 years ago, but I still think fondly on some of those calls.

2019-04-06 20:09:25+00:00,5123,Another “teacher won’t let me go to the bathroom” story,cmunk13,"I went to a pretty small high school, our graduating class was about 80+ people. Because of this, the rules were pretty relaxed. Dress code was to dress professionally, lunch was open campus, you could pretty much do what you wanted as long as you weren’t breaking any rules. This included going to the bathroom. Some teachers would have rules like make sure the teacher sees you leave so they know you aren’t missing, some had bathroom passes which never got used. It was mellow. 

One of my teachers, I’ll call him Champ, didn’t like you going to the bathroom during his lectures, so you basically were expected to wait until he was done talking unless it was an emergency. Champ was also kind of arrogant- he used to be a bad student and had an epiphany when he was older that education was super important and he was convinced that everyone else could feel the same if he just tried hard enough. A really nice guy, great teacher, but he could be a dick if you didn’t agree with him. 

I have endometriosis, I didn’t know this in high school, all I knew was that periods were so painful that I had to stay home and cry all day sometimes. I’m all better now thanks to surgery and meds, but it was rough at the time. I get up during his lecture because I’m cramping badly, and at least in the bathroom I could cry in peace. I stand up, and he turns around.

Champ: hey cmunk13, can this wait until I’m done?

Me: sorry, no. 

I was super embarrassed and didn’t want to say much else so I kept walking out. 

Champ: well you’re going to have to wait until I’m done. 

Me: it’s an emergency. 

Champ: are you going to throw up? 

He laughed. This pissed me off, and I was already in pain so I snapped and said

Me: no, it’s just that I’m on my period and it hurts so badly i was going to curl up in a ball in the bathroom and cry. I could do that here, but I thought it would be more distracting to the class to have me crying in the corner than to just leave quietly. 

Again, small school, so everyone knew I was in a lot of pain and had been super nice about it. People would send me class notes and catch me up when I was out, just a great community. Even people I wasn’t friends with, even people who didn’t like me, they didn’t want me to be publicly humiliated by our teacher. So, they weren’t exactly thrilled at the teacher for pulling this. 

Cut to later in class, my friend stands up to go to the bathroom. My teacher turned around to nod to let them go, and they said 

“If it’s ok, I’m going to go take a shit. It may take like 5-10 minutes, so I’ll ask someone for notes when I come back.”

Which prompted everyone in his class (not just my class, every class he taught) to declare why they were going to the bathroom  in detail for about a week. It was small, but it made me feel so loved- and it’s my favorite petty revenge.

2019-04-06 18:43:56+00:00,2457,Keep me up all night throwing stuff at my windows? Enjoy not having internet!,Mogerin,"So a little bit of backstory:

I live in a college town, about 4-5 miles outside of town in a more rural area in a small apartment complex. There's 4 units with a small courtyard in the middle. Because the area is so small, all 4 units share one router as internet is included with the lease. The landlords never bother to manage the router at all so I log in once and a while and update the firmware. Also because this is such a rural area, there's no noise ordinances, and almost no cell signal. You're lucky if you get 3g.

So, about 8pm, my neighbors have some people come by and get a party going. A pretty common occurrence, no big deal, it was maybe like 10 people. After a few hours, the noise is at a reasonable level, just some noticeable bass from their speakers and a few loud yells now and again, nothing I can't deal with so I decide to go to bed. It was around this time that they decided to go outside and set up a beer pong game in the courtyard.

Now when I say small courtyard, it's small. Maybe 12x12. And they've got 10 people crammed around some tables loudly playing beer pong, with their door open so music is now blasting outside. The area is so small that people are standing on the steps in front my door, which is about 6 feet from my bedroom. Okay, well it's not that late, maybe they won't play for too long. I try to be reasonable about these things since it's a college town. Then the ping pong balls start hitting my windows.

They had decided to push the table up against the side of MY apartment and were attempting to do trick shots by bouncing the balls against my walls and window. It was about 1:30am now, and this is where I drew the line, and decided to call in a noise complaint to no avail(see above). So, not wanting to confront 10 loud and obnoxious drunk people, I think about my options, and decide to check the router. I noticed there was a firmware update, so figured what the heck, lets update it and reboot. 

After a few seconds, their music cut out and they started yelling to get it turned back on. Oh this was going to be fun. After the router reboots, their music starts playing again. So I go to work randomly blocking and unblocking devices, creating a little bit of chaos. I found the phone that was being used to play spotify through trial and error and made that my main target. Every time the music started playing...BLOCK. After a minute of them getting irritated...unblock. Eventually they switch over to a different phone, so I just start powercycling the router every minute or so. Each time the internet shuts off, they get progressively more and more annoyed. After about 15 minutes of this, I hear a series of loud huffs and some plans to move the party to someone else's house.

Sweet sweet victory. I wait for the last car to leave the driveway to confirm I had won, log out of the router and go to bed in silence at last. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/ba7ily/keep_me_up_all_night_throwing_stuff_at_my_windows/,pettyrevenge,97,0.0

Friends with everyone except this one older woman, (OW) who would make snide comments, call me and my friends “young snotty bitches” (YSB) and I’m pretty sure broke into my phone when I left it in a company vehicle once. 

Our supervisor (S) was awesome and hated her just as much as we did but had to be professional. She was also romantically involved with her boss (B). As a result of a preexisting medical condition, she passed away in the middle of the night. 

Supervisor was like a mentor and second mother, and I took her death really hard. So when I heard that OW was spreading rumours it was B’s fault that S died (it obviously wasn’t). No one believed her, but I was furious she would be so nasty to B so soon after the funeral, and decided I was sick of her shit and her drama. 

So the other YSB’s and I started to secretly drive her crazy. If she would talk we would pretend we couldn’t hear, we wouldn’t acknowledge she existed. We wouldn’t talk about anything other than work when we had to talk to her. She was bad at her job and before we just put up with it but now we were as condescending and belittling as you could be without being outright rude, so when she complained about us to B he wouldn’t have to reprimand us. Everything she used to say we were we made a reality, and she couldn’t say shit because we smiled and had a polite tone. (I.e.

2019-04-03 03:23:03+00:00,2368,"So much for being above cheating, huh?",Oxymoronically,"So my Spanish teacher assigns a frankly ridiculous amount of work, most of it busywork. In the class we all just have this unspoken pact where everyone just copies off everyone else because it's basically the only way to stay on top of all the work if you don't want to spend a stupid amount of time doing the homework. Basically, just let people copy your work and they'll return the favor. Simple.

Not everyone participates in our class-wide cheating ring though, which, hey, that's fine, I admire their work ethic. But there's this one girl (we'll call her SB for Smug Bitch) who was in the glad last Sunday and particularly obnoxious and self-righteous about the whole thing. 

Now, I don't consider myself to be a bad student, in fact, I'd say I'm usually the opposite. But if someone wants to copy off me, I'll let them because I know that if I'm having an off day or something, they're gonna have my back. Not SB, though.

SB is one of those people who just has the biggest stick up her ass and just LOVES being better than you. I once made the mistake of asking to copy her work only to receive a rant back about how I should just do the work myself and how it wasn't that hard and also I should fuck off. (For the record, she was right— the work wasn't that hard, it was just the sheer volume of it that was an issue, and she was just being a bitch for no reason.) She also ratted us out to the teacher, which it didn't stop us, but we did have to keep it on the down-low for a while. 

Then SB missed an entire week of school because she had pink eye. First in one eye, and then just as that eye was starting to recover she got it in the other eye.

When she came back to school, she was WAY behind in Spanish, so she panicked. All of a sudden, she decided she wasn't really above cheating after all and wanted in.

Thing is though, when you shit on everyone like that, everyone remembers, and nobody wanted to let her copy their work. None of us said a word about it to each other. Needless to say, once she was behind, it was really really hard for her to get back on top of all the classwork, and we didn't have any sympathy for her because she was the one who was shitting all over her potential safety net.

This semester, she is no longer in our class, and everyone still copies off everyone else to this day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/b8sxa2/so_much_for_being_above_cheating_huh/,pettyrevenge,90,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, I was getting calls from a telemarketer for a home security system, despite living in an apartment.  Two to three times a month sometimes, always from a fake number, their ""Take me off your list"" option didn't work, the whole deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I'd had enough.  The last time I got their call, I decided I had time to spend ending this.  I selected the options to get to a human and talked for 10 minutes about a home security system.  I asked reasonable questions.  Every answer I gave them put me in their target demographic.  I was eagerly interested.   When it was almost credit card time, I suddenly ""remembered"" an appointment and had to leave.  I said, ""Can I call you back afterwards?  I think this is a great deal"" and ""Do you get paid on commission?  Can I ask for you?"" and that sold it.  I got his name (which I didn't care about), and their direct line.  

&amp;#x200B;

I then proceeded to call them 20 times in a row (I counted), saying ""My phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX.  STOP CALLING ME!!!"" and hanging up.  Over and over and over.

I kept driving around doing my errands until her phone rang, about 30 minutes later. i told her where the phone had flown off the roof, how i retrieved it, and mentioned she must have put it up there while getting gas or something. Her response?

2019-03-29 19:59:48+00:00,2810,Don't like my husband? Goodluck finding your theater.,PokeMasterBon,"So this was about 1 or 2 years ago when both me and my hubby were working in our local movie theater.  Now, for this story I need to explain something.  My husband is an immigrant.  English is not his first language but he's learned it from a very young age, so he speaks it fluently, he just has an accent.  He is very self conscious about this and makes an effort to over pronounce words when he's working to make sure he's understood.  On this day, he was working in the box office selling tickets, and I was just inside the entrance of the building to rip tickets and tell people where their theater was located.  It was also our theaters discounted ticket day. On these days, we have to ask every guest if they are members of out reward program so they can get cheapo tickets.  If not, we encourage our paid membership, then if they refuse, our free one.  So he did just that.  But this man, let's call him RA for racist asshole,   just couldn't understand any of this.  For this part of the story I'm repeating what my hubby told me.  My husband tried his usual spiel to RA. RA said no, he didn't want the paid membership and didn't want the free version either, he just wanted his discounted ticket.  My husband tried to explain he needed to sign up for one of the memberships, and RA screams how he shouldn't have to pay money for discounted tickets.  My husband again reminds him of the free version, and RA snaps asking why he didn't say that earlier (he did)  so he signs up gets his ticket and comes in to me.  I greet him and he angrily says how terrible that dirty immigrant in the box office was and how my husband had tried to scam him.  He also made comments about how we need to hire Americans who can actually speak English.  Hearing him spout this B.S. about my husband made my blood boil, but I decided that this douchebag wasn't worth getting fired over.  I take his ticket and say in my customer service voice ""Theater 21 on the right""  he leaves.  His theater was on the left, and we didn't even have a theater 21.  I'm sure he wandered around for a good while, but luckily he never complained.  After my shift, I told my hubby about some RA complaining about him, and told him what I did to him.  My husband thought it was great after a long day dealing with annoying customers, RA included.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/b71xlk/dont_like_my_husband_goodluck_finding_your_theater/,pettyrevenge,80,0.0

We were waiting in line for the train to arrive and when it did, this lady comes out of nowhere and cuts me while going in, almost pushing me out of her way (my mom and I being first in line, with several people behind us who seemed to frown upon her behaviour as well, but no one said anything) The train was packed and she ended up on the side where the doors don’t open, with me essentially blocking her way. A few stops later she starts trying to push past me and she’s like “excuse me, could you move I have to get out.” 

I was still annoyed that she had cut me in line so I just pretended not to hear her until the doors closed. 

Her: “you made me miss my exit!”

Me: “oh you can see me, now? How awfully convenient for you that you couldn’t see me earlier when you cut me in line, huh?” And proceeded to ignore her and essentially badmouth her to my mom, who played along, until our exit.

2019-03-28 10:23:45+00:00,4451,Fire me after 6 years? Well enjoy the lack of bathroom supplies,IMajorInMagick,"For the background I used to work at a fast food restaurant who's logo is a cowboy hat. I worked there for 6 years and got myself up into a management position. I wasn't the GM but I was the night closing managers with a pretty awesome team. I loved them to death and I still talk to them fairly often. However, as with all fast food places, the turn over is kinda high, so I ended up getting a new person on my shifts.

&amp;#x200B;

I hated this entitled little prick.

&amp;#x200B;

He wore it on his sleeve that he only got this job because his parents made him (which yeah I  get it, it's fast food, no one wants to stay there forever. But at least pull your weight and be good to your coworkers instead of being half assed). He was negative, mean to his coworkers, mean to the guests, and an absolutely disrespectful prick to all forms of management (including me).

&amp;#x200B;

We will call him J from now on.

&amp;#x200B;

Some days would be pretty lightly staffed, so I'd end up closing the lobby of the store since it closed about an hour before the drive thru closed. Which means that my register would be the one that took all the lobby traffic. Which meant that J would be on Drive and I'd have a wonderful woman, we'll call D on the back line. She was so nice and working with her is an absolute treat.

&amp;#x200B;

We had no cameras in our store, so when my register came up short on numerous shifts, it was assumed that I was the culprit.

&amp;#x200B;

I was not.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also fired on the same day that J came in with brand new beats that cost about the same amount of money as went missing.

&amp;#x200B;

I was pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

So for a couple of months after that I'd come in right before the dinner rush with my roommate. J was moved to lobby closes. Perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I would go into the girls bathroom and pick the lock to the toilet paper dispenser and throw all of it into the trash bin. Then I'd do the same with the paper towels. All of this while my roommate was doing the same thing in the Men's room. Then we'd get a congrats slider and go home. We did this about a dozen times.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never caught but D told me that J got chewed out multiple times for it. Then he got caught smoking weed in the freezer and got fired.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/b6h2kt/fire_me_after_6_years_well_enjoy_the_lack_of/,pettyrevenge,189,0.0

We get off the first flight and she needed to use the bathroom so she went in while I watched her bags. I see this lady that has two kids in those harnesses keeping them close by. She yanking them and yelling at them for dropping their toys and hustles them into the bathroom. My girlfriend comes out and we get some food while waiting for our flight in an hour.

We get on the plane and I fall asleep and wake up a few hours later to us landing. My girlfriend nudges me and points out that the lady I saw earlier with the kids was also on our flight. My girlfriend then says that when she went into the bathroom she was loudly complaining about how she was going to be late and didn't have time for a line. My girlfriend says she could go in front of her and the lady moves in front of her and says, ""well there is still all these other people in front of you."" 

She was on our flight which wasn't for another hour, so she was just trying to cut in front of people. On top of that, she wasn't even grateful when someone let her in front. And I personally never like people that have their kids on leashes.

I was joking around with my girlfriend how we should give the kids candy or something to get back at the lady. I was kidding but was still keeping my eye open for some sort of pretty revenge.

I 'work' for an organization that coordinates exercises and is supposed to be the extreme idiots. We get students from safety courses and JROTC etc. for large groups for e.g. a riot exercise.

We were in a riot scenario and my task was to keep the group together and make sure they didn't cross that sacred line, all while being the biggest asshole (towards the police). This guy had been complaining my authority for about an hour and after I told him off he tried to punch me in the face. I know, great for a student at a pre-police academy. Anyway, I evaded his punch and threw a punch to the gut. He and his friends cursed me out and I walked away. 

Now the perk of being a coordinator is the ability to walk up to the police trainers and leave suggestions and give feedback etc.. I told the teacher that he'd been annoying etc and that he'd crossed the line multiple times (which he had)  

The trainer thought he'd play a joke and he had the guy and his friends 'arrested' before leaving them handcuffed in the tent for about one and a half hour before telling them they were out. After they were searched it turned out they had brought a small knife. Because the exercise took place on a military base, that was strongly forbidden. They were expelled from the school and banned from ever working for the police and military.

AC “hey, I didn’t know you delivered pizzas!”

Me “Yeah, when work gets slow. Anyway, that’ll be $15.xx”

AC “Here you go.”

He hands me $16 and looks kinda smug about it. I take the cash, am about to turn around and say just loud enough that anyone inside might hear.
“Hey AC, is this your girlfriend’s house, or you and your wife’s place?”

Where I used to work I was on 3rd shift as a salaried supervisor. When I was off work and trying to sleep or relax I was constantly getting work related calls and texts from the other shifts including my boss. I was carrying the whole department basically. 

I loved what I did but I didn’t feel I was getting paid nearly enough so after a year or so I started getting sick of never really being off work. 

My boss had a company paid cell phone and as a manager he was required to keep it on at all times in case there was an emergency at work.

During this time I had an old prepaid phone that was still active with carryover minutes. One night when we were slow at work I used *67, which blocks your number from being displayed, to call his phone and wake him up at 3:00 am. When he sleepily said hello I hung up. I planned on it being a one time thing but when he came in the next morning he was red eyed and exhausted like I was all the time from being called when off work. 

From that point on I would call him in the middle of the night two or three times per week. Most of the time I would let it ring three or four times and hang up. Sometimes I would call him from my real phone and pretend I “butt dialed” him. On the days I would call him when he was sleeping he would drag in looking rough and I would take secret pleasure in seeing him feel like I did since I was still constantly being called when I was off. 

Occasionally he would comment that some “damn asshole” called his phone and woke him up. After about a year they hired another supervisor so my work was cut in half. I finally got some time to relax and get some rest. I stopped calling him at that point after almost a year. 

Sometimes I’m torn between feeling bad about doing it and also that maybe I should have done it more.

2019-03-15 01:09:03+00:00,2171,Parking lot revenge,CasaHnasa,"Several years ago, I lived in a gated apartment complex. I don't know what the builders were thinking when they made the parking lot, but it was a disaster. Each apartment got one reserved, covered parking spot, and then there were a few (very very few) free spots. One early early October morning I got home super late from my job at a haunted house. Like 4am or something. I couldn't find a parking spot anywhere. I drove around and around and around. I did three laps of the entire complex looking for a free spot. There were none. No free spots, but some ASSHOLE was taking up two spots. Some other poor soul had squeezed in between him and the wall. They weren't even in a parking spot. Just the empty space between the wall and the other car. It was a small car, but a tight fit.

I considered parking someplace else and walking home, but I didn't want my car towed or stolen, and I'd have to climb the wall. I was too tired to climb the wall. So, I did what I had to do. I rolled down both my windows so I could see the sides of my car more clearly, and I inched my way into the half parking spot that was not taken. It took a LOT of back and forth, getting the angle right so I didn't scratch either car. I didn't care about my paintjob. I didn't even have one. I was driving a crappy old car. Key me idgaf. 

It took me probably 45 minutes, but I was pretty pissed off and determined. This guy always did this and I was sick of it. Finally, I got the car in park. It was sandwiched so tightly between the two cars, that I couldn't even put my hand between my side mirror and their door. It was close enough that my arm wouldn't fit between the cars, let alone my body. I popped the trunk, folded down the seats, and spiderman crawled out of the back of my car. I took a moment to admire my handiwork. It was beautiful. I was closer to being in the parking spot than he was. I just looked like I was bad at parking. He looked like he'd parked illegally, so if one of us was gonna get towed, it would be him.

I felt bad for the guy on my left, as I was blocking his passenger side, and he'd have to pull out of the spot before someone could get in. The asshole, though, had his driver's side blocked. He'd either have to climb in through the trunk, or climb over from the passenger side. Served him right, too. Don't take two spaces when parking is limited.

Now, perhaps the pettiest part of this, is that I didn't have work the next day. Or the day after that, or the day after that. I worked nights from Thursday to Sunday, and I slept all day. I'd already done my grocery shopping the day before, and I didn't have anywhere to be for three whole days. That car was stuck there all three days. I checked every day. It hadn't moved.

When I was a manager at McDonalds I had a guy do this.

We had a freak rush on chicken nuggets, like 5 20 pieces in a row. The customer pulls to the window. The cashier let him know it was going to be another 3 minutes for his nuggets and did he want to wait or get something else. He demands to speak with the manager. He says that he has been waiting 5 minutes already and he isn’t going to pay or move until his food is ready. I said that I needed him to pay and pull forward in order to clear the drive thru. He refused and said they’ll have to wait.

I went to the back window, put a drawer in and we started cashing and giving the food out there.

20 minutes later, fuming customer at the front window begins pounding on the window.

I open it and he screams at me to know where his food was. I told him he wasn’t getting any food, he was blocking my drive thru and impeding my business and he needed to leave or I would be calling the police.

It looked like he would explode with anger, but he just screeched out of there.

It was the most satisfying interaction with an entitled customer I had while working at McDonald’s.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/b10tid/nuggets_in_the_drive_thru/,pettyrevenge,102,0.0

2019-03-13 19:56:06+00:00,2989,Make me move from an unassinged seat? Have fun getting a zero on your Unit Test.,ThatRealPotato,"Okay so a little background: Im a high school student and there is no assigned seats. Classroom has around 25 people. If you don't know shadow students are kids who are thinking of going to the school and follow a student around and see what student life is. The person who I got my revenge too, lets just call her Emily (cuz thats her name.)

ROLL CALL!

Me= Me

E= Emily

T= Teacher

EF= Emily's friend

Anyways: So I walk into my classroom to find that the seat I usually sit in is taken by a shadow student. She is shadowing the girl who sits next to me so she sat in my seat. I move since, it's not a big deal. I take the back left corner and wait for the class to start. Fast forward a few seconds and the girl who usually sits in the seat I was in comes up to me. Now, let me remind you that there are no assigned seats. So, she comes up to me and in a very demanding and rude tone says, ""Get out of my seat! I always sit here and I want to talk with my friends!""

M= uhhh, there is no assigned seat you can just sit next to me.

Let me say this, there were two open seats, one to the right, and one in front of me.

E= Yeah but I sit here everyday. I want to sit here for the test! its my lucky spot.

EF= dude cmon just move!

Now she was extremely rude to me when she first spoke, if she had been nice I would have moved.

M= again, there is no assigned seat, just take the one there.

I point to the one next to me but the girl is taking none of it.

E= Wow, you are so rude! You wont let me sit in my ASSIGNED SEAT!

Bish tf?

M= For the last time there is no assigned seats, is it really a big deal? Just go to the one next to me.

I take my eyes of her so I can focus on rereading the topic for the test. Then I hear a sharp voice from the front of the room

T= Potato! E has told me you have been very rude to her and that you stole the seat she was about to sit in. You need to move so she can sit in the seat she wants to!

Not wanting to go against the sheer devil of the teacher I have, I move to the seat riiiiiigghhht in front of her. Class starts and the teacher hands out the test, now it is a big Unit test so its worth a lot and our grades are about to be set in stone after the test. Here is where the petty revenge begins. During the test I hear a slight whisper from behind me. I stay still and make sure its the girl who was the rude one to me. It was. I look to the wall towards them and I can see them out of the corner of my eye huddled together so they can talk quieter. Perfect. I turn back around only to turn around again but with a huge loud motion and say in a commanding voice, the same one she used on me. ""Can you please stop talking I'm trying to take the test here!"" Now because I moved so quick and suddenly that they just froze, still huddled together. The teacher looks up from his desk and sees that I'm yelling at the girls and that they were huddled together and puts the pieces together. He was mean, not dumb. He walks to the girls desk and takes the tests off their tables.

T= Girls, I told everyone before the test that if you talk at all you would get a zero. You have disturbed Potato here and probably the people around him. And, I don't know what you were talking about so all I know is that you are cheating. I'm sorry but this is gonna be a zero on your test. Please go to the deans.

The girls try to explain themselves in any way or form but as mention, the teacher is a hard ass and didn't care to listen. They stood up and walked to the office, tears forming in their eyes. This was right before lunch so I had time to find them during lunch and I saw them with their entire group of friends, and make up running down their faces. Next time don't be rude to someone who can punch back.

&amp;#x200B;

When my co-worker was a child, they used to have a neighbour. And said neighbour's landlord was a complete douchebag. She would charge rent for anything and everything which is in her house and looked for who knows how many excuses just to be able to charge more rent. She even charged more rent simply because their neighbour would use the fireplace. So one day the neighbour moved out, but not without leaving a little gift. The neighbour went to a fish-market, got an eel and then hid it in the fireplace. 

What lead my co-worker to tell me this story was that his mother, who still lives there, called him yesterday. She told him, that ever since the neighbour moved out, the house wasn't rented to anybody else ever again. And the landlord still didn't firgure out that the neighbour put an eel into the fireplace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/b0lpba/charge_rent_for_literally_every_little_thing_good/,pettyrevenge,127,0.0

Anyway, I'm in a department store whose name rhymes with Bal-Cart, pushing my cart down the frozen food aisle, when some old lady sneezes as I walk past.

Me: ""Gesundheit.""

Her: ""YOUNG MAN!"" (I'm already annoyed because I'm pushing 50 and f\*\*king HATE being called young.) ""This is America!  When someone sneezes, you say 'god bless you'!""

I went to bed, he went back downstairs to watch a movie or something. Well, we have cats and the noise and light was throwing off their schedule. Normally they sleep with us all night, 10pm to 6am. Instead, they kept running up and down the stairs and jumping all over me when I was trying to sleep. If I close the bedroom door, they scratch at it and cry.

He doesn't know the password. 

A few minutes later, I hear another movie going and I'm super confused until I realize he's probably now on our Hulu account. So I check on my phone, and yep. So I did the same thing. I hear it stop, he grumbled something and started turning everything off.

I was mainly a cashier, and to be honest I really loved doing it. The clientele was significantly nicer than at the grocery store I previously worked at, and I enjoyed having the occasional chat about plants with people. 

Because this was a mainly Italian area, I did deal with a lot of older Italian people whose English wasn't very good. Most of the time, they would make an effort to speak English, I would do my best in Italian, and everything would work out well. 

One day, however, I was at the till cashing out an elderly woman and her adult daughter. The woman was trying to haggle with me about the prices (obviously not something I can change as a cashier) and generally complaining about things that are far beyond my control. I was polite and courteous, and eventually the old woman gave up, realizing she wouldn't get any freebies from me. And then the tirade began. 

To her daughter (who seemed mortified and kept telling her to stop in hushed tones), she began insulting me in Italian. This went on throughout the entirety of the transaction, and I pretended to be oblivious to it, even though on the inside I was fuming. 

Finally, the woman pays (while telling her daughter she thought I was going to short-change her), takes her bags, and as I hand her the receipt, I tell her in a cheerful tone, in Italian, ""Have a great day!""

The old woman looked absolutely *horrified* and basically ran out of the store as quickly as she could. Her daughter laughed and gave me a big smile as she left. 

I saw the old lady a few more times after that, and every other time I saw her, she was always *very* polite. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/aydlob/rude_old_woman_thinks_she_can_insult_me_behind_my/,pettyrevenge,147,0.0

I finally got to work at Super Haunts on year and I loved every single minute of it. It's the best thing for a super dramatic person like me.

Now there is one huge rule about Super Haunts and basically any haunted house: don't touch the actors and don't touch stuff. Super Haunts goes all out. We have animatronics, puppets, floors that move, etc. It's the works. And some of the stuff we have? Well it costs some money and we also don't want it damaged. But of course, people are dumbasses.

One night, I wasn't really in the mood for people messing with me or with stuff so I scared a few people but one guy? One guy was just kinda asking to be scared. 

Big time.

Now, one of the best ways to scare people is to pretend you're not real. I did that all the time. The outfit I wore made it look like I was an old maid wearing a bonnet so people couldn't see my face if I look down. Now I heard this guy coming, he kept saying things weren't scary and I glanced up to see him messing with the stuff in my room. He was just being really annoying, loud and making fun of people being scared.

Time to shared.

I slowly go behind him. He doesn't notice me. His friends do but I can tell they're tired of him. They didn't say anything, just waited for me to do my thing. I inhaled and let out a blood curdling scream. 

I swear, if this guy could have, I think he would have jumped out of his skin. He shouted, jumped up and then fell on the floor. He looked up at me with this terrified look and I just stared at him. Now, instead of getting up and walking, he just crawls. I've had people do this before, it was nothing new. But I don't stop. I just grin at him and start to laugh. That is what I was best at, the creepy laugh. I'd start off soft, then get more loud and manic. Soon, I'm cackling like mad and this guy is still crawling to get to the other room. His friends were dying of laughter.

And things only got worse for him because the room next to mine?

It's the chainsaw room.

So once he crawled away from me, I heard him screaming again as one of my co-workers rushed at him with the toy chainsaw",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/axw5jt/dont_be_a_dick_at_a_haunted_house/,pettyrevenge,143,0.0

It was the beginning of July, and all the fireworks stands had just opened up for those of us who want to celebrate the ol USA by blowing bits of it up. A firework stand opened up about a 1/4 mile from our house and my brother was finally old enough to purchase fireworks without an adult. I, by state law (or maybe parental law?) , was still too young to stay home alone. My brother decided he wanted to go to the fireworks stand and he didn't want to wait until 5pm when my mom got home. So he told me it was ok for us to go. I strapped on my rollerblades and to boom town we went. On the way home is when my bro decided to be an asshole. He picked up a stick and threw it right in front of my rollerblades. Down I went, landing badly on my arm. My mom was *pissed* she had to leave work early and take me to the doctor for my broken arm. But eventually I came home with a bright pink fiberglass cast on my arm. And my mom wasn't the only one pissed. Being a younger sister, I had to get my revenge. 

So I waited, until a few days later when we had to go somewhere, I forget where. My brother was walking just behind me and to the left, the side of my broken arm. I swung my arm forward for momentum then rammed it backwards, and NAILED him in the balls. Down he went. My mom, who hadn't been paying attention until my brother's high pitched shriek of pain and outrage. I welled up with tears and clutched my arm and told my mom that my brother was walking too close and ran into my wrist and now it hurt really bad.  I dont know if my brother bought it, but my mom did. I was, after all, the wounded one. She told my brother it was an accident and to walk it off.

My brother has recently come home from college, just to stay for a couple of weeks and sort some things out. While this is great and all, I've realized our relationship is a lot better when we don't live in the same house. He's only three years older then me, so we bicker quite a lot, with him thinking he's superior and much more mature than I am. That he should get what he wants because he was born first, yadah yadah yadah. He's not always an asshole about it, just more annoying, but today he really pissed me off.

Que Wednesday morning. I woke up to my phone only on 30 percent. Confused, I looked at the outlet and someone had taken my charging block. My parents don't really use their phones that much and often forget to charge them, so I knew they wouldn't care enough to come into my room and steal it. So the next suspect? My brother. I went into his room to see his phone plugged in with MY block. I told him to give it back and he shrugged and said he brought it from school. Yeah, bullshit. I went and complained to my mother, who just shrugged and said to get over it and get a new one. Now, I know it's not that big of a deal, but he went into MY room and then had the audacity to lie to me. I reluctantly got another block while my brother gave me his stupid smug little grin. 

That afternoon he wanted to go hang out with friends. So my first plan of action? Getting my block back. Oh I got it all right. Along with every other block, and his charging cord, in the entire house. I put them in one of my boots and shoved it into the back of my closet. Then plugged in my phone in an outlet that couldn't be seen in plain view. He gets home, phone almost dead. Frantically looking for block. Tell him I don't know what he's talking about and maybe he should go buy a new one. His phone dies and my mom tells me he can buy a new one tomorrow. 

That night it floods. Bad. Can't leave the house. He is stuck with a dead phone for four days.

2019-03-03 11:41:38+00:00,3891,Don't Tip All Week and Repeatedly Insult Me? Have Fun Trying to Leave!,TinyNuggins92,"I used to work as a valet at a hotel near the downtown strip of a large tourist city. It is a tipped position, and as such, I was making only $5/hour. The only reason it was that high, was because I was the shift supervisor. Before the promotion, it was the standard $2.13/hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

One week, there was two rather trashy ladies who stayed at the property. They were there about 5 days in total I believe. They had us valet their dump of an SUV (self-parking was a thing there, and cheaper than having us park it). They would use the valet staff - who also doubled as the bellmen - for almost everything, repeatedly insulting us all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

They shop for groceries at the Piggly Wiggly and have us take their groceries to their room (it was an extended-stay property with a kitchenette and cabinets) put them all away, and then not tip. The whole time we'd hear how horrible the place was - it wasn't - how terrible we were at our jobs - again also untrue - and about how we're probably all just loser musicians unable to make it (partially true, but still insulting nonetheless).

&amp;#x200B;

They'd utilize our free shuttle service to the downtown bar strip, and complain the whole time about how we weren't a 24-hour service, about how long it would take to get a cab back to the hotel (they literally line up by the bars all night and it was maybe a $10 ride).

&amp;#x200B;

After 5 nights of this crap, the whole valet staff was rather fed up. We don't expect monumental tips from guests, just $2 - $3 here or there for parking their vehicles, handling their luggage and taking them to go binge-drinking. Not once did these ""ladies"" tip. We'd have some guests who wouldn't tip their entire stay, but then give one large one at the end of their stay to cover it all. Not these people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I brought their vehicle up on the morning they were to check out, loaded their luggage for them, and handed over their keys. They then decided to eat breakfast and scoff at me as they walked inside. 20 minutes later, they still had not come out to leave. We had limited space on the drive and a lot of guests checking out. Cue pettiness: 

&amp;#x200B;

The next four vehicles I brought up, I made sure to box theirs in, to keep it from leaving and hand off the keys as quickly as possible before telling guests to go enjoy their breakfast. We'd usually keep the keys, just in case we needed the extra space right up until the guests left. Sure enough, while still boxed in, my very trashy guests come out to leave, proceed to yell at me for boxing their vehicle in. All I would say is ""I'm sorry ma'am those guests already have their keys and we've been a little short on space this morning. Lot of guests checking out today. I'm so sorry!""

It’s really cool if your a big fan of whatever show is being featured, which I was. 


One of my favorite shows was scheduled to be there so of course I got tickets. These panels are also a great way to get autographs/photos of your favorite actors after it wraps. So I brought a piece of merchandise from the show to hopefully get autographed by the cast. 


Now, these panels are filled with fans but there’s also people that go just for the purpose of getting an autograph and selling it. This particular show’s cast had an actor in it that had just starred in the newest superhero movie so there were a lot of people there that you could tell just wanted to get an autograph to sell.


So the panel ends and there is a mad dash for the stage for autographs. My seat was near the front so I was able to get a perfect spot for autographs. The actors are making their way down the front of the stage so I reach to grab my pen and realize it’s gone. It must have fallen out of my pocket. I look over and there is a guy next to me and I notice he’s got like 5 pens. He’s also clearly there to sell his autograph afterwards. So I politely ask if I can use one of his pens and he says:


“Sure, that’ll be 5 dollars.”


I asked if he was serious and he said yes. I told him I only needed it for a moment and would give it back. He just shrugs and repeats himself, “5$”. So I told him to fuck off. 


I turned back towards the stage and this nice girl near me had overheard us and handed me one of her pens and smiled. I thanked her profusely and waited for my turn to get an autograph. This is where my petty revenge comes in (finally, I know). 


So like I said, I had a great spot but the guy who wouldn’t give me a pen was behind me so I decided to do my best to block him from getting the autograph I knew he wanted most. 


When the big actor came out everyone was trying to get his autograph and he clearly won’t be able to get everyone. I raised my arms and made it so that he couldn’t even see the guy behind me. The guy kept trying to get around me but I wouldn’t let him. Then, once I got my autograph, I told the girl who gave me a pen to get in front of me so she could have a better shot. I backed up to let her in, pushing the guy back from the stage even more. He was fuming and I just smiled. 


The actor moved on down the line to sign more autographs. The girl and I both got our stuff signed. And I saw the guy get visibly red and furious for having missed the one autograph that he actually wanted.

2019-02-28 18:13:18+00:00,5587,Yell at someone for squishing a water bottle? Have fun listening to mine.,whatsthebfor,"Insert obligatory apology about mobile.

So, I don't know if it counts since it's revenge for someone else, but this is going on literally right now. I'm taking the trolley to school, as I do every morning, and it's a bit crowded. Unfortunately, there are always douchebags on the trolley.

So I'm in a section with four seats, two sets of two facing each other, with another section of four seats across the narrow aisle. On the other side of the aisle, there's a mom, dad, and their daughter. In order to keep people from intruding on the ""personal space,"" they put the daughter's backpack on the fourth seat, the mom puts her foot up on it, and the dad crosses his legs in a way where whoever would sit in the fourth seat would have basically no leg room. (Side note: if you take public transportation, don't expect personal space, especially at peak hours.)

So this old man gets on, and he sees this technically vacant seat. He goes up and asks them nicely to sit down, and the parents huff and puff but oblige.

Now, this old guy definitely is a bit out of it, as many old people are, but he's clearly harmless. However, he's got an empty plastic water bottle with him that he's crunching in his hands, either to pass time or to comfort him. As much as I don't love the sound, I appreciate that this guy didn't just drop the bottle in the aisle or jam it between the seats as many trolleygoers do. The mom and dad, on the other hand, are clearly irritated.

They try huffing and puffing for a few stops, but when that doesn't work, the mom shoots a glare at him and yells, ""Would you stop making all that fucking noise!""

The old man is embarrassed and limits his squishing and does his best to do it as quietly as possible, but since it's his comfort object, he doesn't stop entirely. The dad legit thanks his wife and kisses her forehead.

I'm pissed though. I can't believe these entitled fuckers think it's okay to intimidate and shame this man over crunching a water bottle. It's not like the whole trolley is silent except the bottle. There's people listening to music out loud, babies whining, and several people talking, including mom and dad themselves, and not to mention the white noise of the wheels on the tracks and the stop announcements. So, I decided to do something.

As with every morning, I had put a water bottle in my backpack, so they didn't know I had one. So I just whip it out, open it, and drink about half of it. I then close the bottle, but instead of putting it back in my backpack, I keep it in my hand and start crunching. It was subtle at first, seemingly innocent, but once I noticed them in my periphery both looking over at me angrily, I crunch it louder. 

They can't say anything to me though cause 1. I'm across the aisle, and 2. I have my headphones in. For all they know, I didn't even realize the mom had yelled at the old man. If they wanted to catch my attention, they'd have to be much louder, and I could always feign not hearing. They would've had to pull my headphones out in that case, and then that would've been an actual violation of personal space, I would've made a scene, and they would be the bad guys. I know this. They know this. They can't do shit.

And so I'm sitting here crunching this water bottle, avoiding their glares, and as the cherry on top, my crunching gave the old man the confidence to continue crunching his water bottle at full force.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/avu80o/yell_at_someone_for_squishing_a_water_bottle_have/,pettyrevenge,209,0.0
2019-02-28 15:48:11+00:00,2759,Badmouth me? Then I'll badmouth you to your boss,chayam,"So for a bit of background, I grew up in a place where we have 2 main languages. The native language is almost dead in my area of the country, but I was educated fully in that language and am bilingual. I also don't have the accent of a native speaker, due to the area I was raised in. This has lead to a few funny situations where I've overheard something that I was not meant to understand, but this time was definitely the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

So one day I was in a cafe, and after placing my order, I was quite surprised and happy to hear that the server and one of the customers were speaking that language together. I was, however, less happy once I heard what they were saying. They basically immediately began criticising me, the way I dressed, my weight, the fact that I was 'wearing too much makeup', etc. I debated saying something, but decided to wait until they'd dug themselves into a deeper hole. 

&amp;#x200B;

So about 10 minutes pass and they go on from badmouthing me to talking about a man that one of them was seeing in excruciating detail. They were in the middle of debating about the size of his hands when the door jangled and they immediately shut up. The newcomer began talking to the worker, and I quickly realised it was her boss.

&amp;#x200B;

So, having finished my coffee, I decided to go wreak a little petty revenge. I walked up, and patted the boss on the shoulder. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry to bother you, but I wanted to let your staff know that talking about someone when they think they can't understand is very rude."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I then laid out to the boss exactly what I had overheard the two of them say, and had the joy of watching the server's face get paler and paler when she realised I had understood her perfectly the entire time. The boss looked pretty pissed, and I get the feeling that after I left she was in for a major dressing down. Petty? Yeah. Worth it? Definitely yeah.

AK = Asshole kid

TH = The teacher

Me = Me (Big shocker)

This happened around 2 years ago in my 6th grade math class, so I don't remember everything, so ill do my best to recreate it

So the TH puts a question up on the board, and I raise my hand to give an answer. I get it wrong, it was a hard question, and she moves on to another student. Then TH puts up another question.

In comes AK, she sat right next to me.

AK: Hey you shouldn't answer this. We all know that you're stupid because of your autism

Me: That's not what autism does.

AK: No, you got that last one wrong. It was SO easy.

Me: Then why didn't you do it?

AK: Just don't waste our time by giving out wrong answers. I'm sorry, but we all can't be smart.

I guess she must have been fairly loud because TH comes over. 

TH: Whats going on here?

AK and me not wanting to have to make this a bigger deal then it is, we both say nothing, and the teacher goes and puts another question on the board. I guess AK felt cocky thinking she could prove to me that shes better so she raises her hand. She got it wrong. I saw my chance here. I figured out what it was, and gave it as an answer. 

Me: (To AK) I'm sorry, but we all can't be smart.

2019-02-27 15:30:52+00:00,3748,Overprivileged Parking,randombcommenter,"On mobile, sorry for any formatting issues 

Back in college, I lived in this on campus apartment that was separated from the rest of the campus. Parking was very limited over there, which leads to many issues. 

Early on in the year, there was one girl with a shiny new BMW that mommy and daddy just bought her who thought she was entitled to take up multiple spots when she parked, no matter how packed the parking lot was. One day when I saw her in the act, I asked her to move her car over so that I can take the spot next to her. She immediately snapped back, saying “mind your own fucking business, I can park however I want.” Not wanting to cause any issues, I drove away. 

The next day, I saw her car parked the same way, and saw my opportunity. My car was older and already beat up, so I didn’t care to much about the condition of it. I got out, folded my mirror in, and pulled in to the spot next to her. I stayed within the lines, but got so close that she couldn’t open up the driver door. A few minutes later, my roommate (who drives a massive truck and knew about what happened) sends me a picture. He had parked so close to her on the other side that now none of the doors could be opened. We then waited until she came out to her car(we could see the cars from our apartment), and boy did she throw a tantrum. The only thing funnier was watching her climb through the trunk to get into her car. After that, she made sure to never double park again. 

Tl;dr: over entitled student double parks, gets boxed in and has to climb through her trunk to get into her car, never double parks again ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/aveot9/overprivileged_parking/,pettyrevenge,92,0.0

2019-02-25 12:22:21+00:00,3588,Asshole parking,Whatever_ho,"Backstory: I live in an appartment with a parking in the back, but we always leave by the backdoor anyway because it's a lot easier. We have a parking space but we don't own a car so we rent it to one of the neighbours. We're in Canada so there's a lot of snow everywhere, the city usually shovels it in the morning. I'm also in crutches right now. 


Now with the story. A few days ago, a random car took our parking spot. They parked in the worst way possible, blocking our path to get outside. It was literally impossible for me to go around it in my crutches. We could leave by the front door, but the sidewalk on this side is one of the last to be shoveled, it can take until noon after a big snow day. My dad still had to do it all by hand just so I could get out of the house. We checked with the neighbour who rents the space and it wasn't them. We decided to leave a note, explaining they couldn't just park there without asking and even drew a no parking sing on their car window in the snow.


The next day, the car is still there, but they clearly left and came back. We left another note, giving them a last warning to just park in the street, which all the neighbours who have two cars or have guests do.


Guess what, yesterday morning the car is there again. So we did what we thought would teach them a lesson. My dad and my brother shoveled all the snow in our yard and even our neighbour's yard and covered that car in snow. By covered, I mean that you could see the general shape of the car, and that's it. So much snow you could think nothing was there under it.


This morning the car is gone, we'll have to shovel again since the snow is blocking the path, but it was totally worth it. I didn't see them try to uncover their car, but it must have taken at the very least an hour, most probably two.


Don't steal parking space and listen to warnings, people are petty and will make your day harder. Also, don't be an asshole.

Very well.,TJ_Will,"I was at the front waiting at a red light when I looked down to change the radio station. I had just hit the first preset button when I hear the triple-horn blast from behind me. Sure enough the light had just turned green, so I get my pickup truck moving and give a “sorry about that” wave.

I guess that wasn’t good enough for the Grand Prix qualifier in the Acura who whipped around and passed me (median-divided, 2 lanes per side) and gave me another horn blast as he pulled away. Fine, whatever jack-weasel.

He is in the front seat while his SO (I assume) is giving him a talking-to about something. She is talking, he has his head turned watching her. 

The light is still red as I sit behind them.

I watch.

Oh. Please. Please.

The light turns green. I give it a two count. He hasn’t moved.

I lay down on my horn with the all the petty vengeance I can muster. He turns his head to look back and I give the most sarcastic smile and wave of my life. He just shakes his head and drives off.

2019-02-24 14:43:19+00:00,2486,Prawn Revenge,CharlesOberonn,"I live in Israel which has kinda strict religious dietary rules. It's not straight up illegal and you can find non-kosher food, but it's difficult.

Back when I was in elementary school, our homeroom teacher (I believe that's the American equivalent to what her job was) for 3rd and 4th grade was a total foodie, and she would take any excuse she could to host a special lunch or meal in the classroom. Everyone would bring something: Plastic plates, cups, pita bread, hummus, drinks, etc. And the student with the top grade got to bring whatever they'd like.

Since I was one smart cookie, I ended up the top student during the first month she held this classroom lunch (and also during some of the following months, but we each only got one time) so I got to pick what to bring. Originally I considered bringing a board game I loved so my friends and I could play during the lunch (it was Talisman iirc), but I knew it'd just get messed up and pieces get lost, so I asked my mom to make one of her ""world famous"" (to me, at least) homemade pepperoni pizzas.

Now, mixing dairy and meat isn't kosher in the least. But it was a secular school and I knew the teacher and most everyone else were secular as well, so I didn't think it'd be a problem.

I was wrong. Because you see, turns out one girl *was* religious, and she had serious problems with my pepperoni pizza. She wasn't even from a religious home, she just decided to be religious as a fad. I doubt she's observant today.

She made a total hissy fit only a 9-year-old who's convinced she found her true calling in life could make, and said the pepperoni pizza was insulting to her. Since she couldn't eat it ""it wasn't fair"". I argued I didn't eat hummus (didn't like the taste, still don't) but I wasn't complaining about other people eating it. But she wasn't having it. She demanded that if she can't (won't) eat the pizza, nobody should. Eventually, my homeroom teacher obliged and threw my mom's pizza in the fucking garbage can.

That's when the seeds of revenge were planted.

I wanted to ruin her meal just like she ruined mine. Luckily, she was one of the top students, so her day to pick what to bring to the classroom lunch wasn't too far away. I knew the best way to enact my salty umami revenge was to make HER meal non-kosher. So she, and by extension, everybody, couldn't eat it either. And I went for the most nuclear of non-kosher foods: shellfish.

It's three-four months later, we're having another classroom lunch. I had to bring paper cups for this one. But I also brought a packet of salted dried shrimp which I bought a few weeks before in preparation from the East-Asian aisle of a local supermarket.

In the last period before the lunch, pseudo-religious girl walks into the classroom with the ugliest tiramisu I've ever seen and an even uglier smug smile. It's dairy, even better.

I doubt anybody would've wanted to eat it anyway. But certainly nobody would eat it after recess, when we all came back to find a new coating of crispy orange shrimps on top of the creamy mess that was her tiramisu. The girl was pissed, and the homeroom teacher was also angry in her own more restrained way.

The teacher demanded the person responsible step forward and confess. Nobody did of course since we were in third grade. My friends knew it was me, but they didn't tell on me.

The homeroom teacher ended up throwing the tiramisu in the garbage because it was ruined, and the entire lunch was canceled as a form of collective punishment. Most people blamed the teacher for being a ""fat bitch"", some blamed the girl for not being cool with the prank and ruining everyone's fun.

I was walking exceptionally slow because I had nowhere special to be at the moment.  I see a lane with a couple customers in it that looks like the shortest, so I make my way over, again, very slowly.  In my peripheral I sense somebody to my right but didn't pay them much mind, if I drew a straight line from the checkout to her I would have been  in between, but slightly off the line.  behind me was the checkout manager monitoring the fluidity of the lanes.

I was the picked on kid in my \~\~school\~\~ class, so when some little shit in my year wanted to make a 'big man' of himself he tried to start a fight with me.  
He wound me up constantly all day, giving me little shoves and calling me out, until eventually just before my maths class I turned round and jawed him.  
His face just splits into this smirk and he immediately runs off and tells the teacher.  


Now at this point my heart just dropped. Discipline in my school was fucked, as in most high schools, and the vast vast majority of teachers would simply have referred to the school rules which would have had me in isolation for a day at the very least. There were some good teachers who would stand up for me, but those instances were few and far in between, to the point where I still remember this incident like it was yesterday 10 years later.

  
I'm pretty sure she'd seen the whole thing anyways but she comes over and says ""What happened"", the kid blurts out immediately that I'd hit him in the face. She asks him why I did it, and he says it was because he was pushing me and calling me names (obviously still expecting me to get into trouble for 'escalating' the situation).  
She just deadpan turns to him and says ""Well if you were pushing him and pushing him trying to get a reaction, whose fault is it that he eventually snapped and hit you?"" The kid absolutely withers under the looks she's giving him (hard ass maths teacher, the sort you didn't fuck with in class) She forced this kid to admit that it was his own fault, and made him apologize to me.  


She told me not to hit people and made me apologize to him too, but I received no real punishment for absolutely decking someone who deserved it, and I'll never forget the look on the kid's face when he realised he'd just grassed himself up to the scariest female teacher in the school.

Frequently we argue over dishes as they often keep dishes in their room for days before bringing them all out and leaving them in the sink, not washing them. A few days ago this happened again. I told my daughter she needed to wash her dishes and she said they're not her dishes so shes not going to wash them. 

So, I came up with a plan. I washed all the dishes and put them on a shelf in my bedroom. Only leaving 4cups, 4 bowls and 4 plates in the kitchen. I told her all my dishes will be in the other room and if I find dishes in the sink i'll assume those are not hers either and put them away. She just laughed at the time. 

Over the last 2 days they have continued to leave dishes in the sink and each time at the end of the day I quitley wash what was left and put it away in my room. Now after 3 days they have run out of dishes and my daughter is irate. She says I'm being petty. I told her they'll have to go buy their own dishes and they better wash them so they don't disappear too!

I took my daughter homecoming shopping at our local mall. She was in a dressing room, and I had several dresses hanging on the outside of the door. 

The shop was very busy, and full. I was standing outside her door waiting for her to come out and show me the dress she was trying on when a EB came over. 

The EB started looking through the dresses we had chosen hanging on the door. I said, "" excuse me, but those are dresses my daughter is about to try on."" 

The EB says, "" I know, but my daughter really wanted to try on this black one, and you have the only one in her size."" 

I told EB that she could have it after my daughter tried it on, if she decided it wasn't what she wanted. EB huffed and walked away.

My daughter came out in a red dress she really liked, but still wanted to try on the rest. I was holding the red dress. EB comes back, and asked if she's done with the dress yet. I say no, shes she's trying it on now. EB gets huffy and tells my daughter to hurry up. Then she eyes the red dress in my hand and says, "" what about that one?"" I told her it was a contender, and she goes off complaining that we have taken all the dresses in her daughter's size. 

Then she notices another dress we have hanging on the door and completely loses it. Screaming about how that was the dress her daughter had come for, and we were ruining her first formal shopping trip. 

At this point, I was livid! I told her to go away, that it was also my daughters first formal, and she should've come earlier. She walked over to her daughters fitting room and started loudly telling her that the "" rude people,"" over there had every dress in the daughters size. 

We had six dresses. 

My daughter tried them all on, but was having trouble deciding which out of the three this woman wanted, was her favorite, all while listening to this woman make a scene. 

I told my daughter to get dressed, and hung the three dresses she definitely didn't want on the go back wrack, keeping the three dresses the woman wanted in my arms. 

People had started lining up to try on dresses, and EB refused to let her daughter come out of the fitting room because she was waiting on the three dresses in my arms. 

EB came over as my daughter came out of the fitting room, and very nastily asked her if she'd made a decision. My daughter was almost in tears. I made up my mind at that moment.

We've decided to take all three I said smugly.  That way she can decide in the comfort of our home with no pressure! 

The woman followed me to the register in disbelief as I purchased all three dresses cursing me every step. 

She tried to tell the cashier that it wasn't fair, but the cashier just told her that I had every right to buy as many dresses as I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

the school had about 30 parking spots which were all reserved for staff, and made all the school mums park on the street. at the first day back at school after the 6 week break, we had multiple parents park in our driveway as our electric gate was broken and allowed basically anyone onto our property. we asked these people to move and they complied, and we thought that was the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

onto the next day, a new parent parks in our driveway for about a week and will never move when asked, causing havoc for all my family's cars. on the monday of the second week that she did this, i had had enough of her blocking my car in and having to use my sisters. as always she would not move and so i hatched a plan. i moved my sisters, my mums and my dads cars all around so that she was blocked in. she didn't notice as she was on her phone.

&amp;#x200B;

5 minutes later her kid returns and gets in the mums car, and she tries to leave, before realising what i had done. there was no way to get around this, so her choice was to get out, nearly bash our front doors in, and verbally abuse me. eventually i moved yhe car in front of hers so she could leave ( this was about 20 mins after her child arrived) and she sped off and lost control on the gravel driveway and ended up scraping her car along my neighbours brick wall. safe to say she didn't return after.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/asrisa/park_in_our_driveway_ill_make_your_life_a_living/,pettyrevenge,229,0.0

One day, I was cashiering and a woman in either her 50s or 60s comes in. She’s not particularly pleasant, but she’s fine. She tells me that she’s taken up crocheting, and asks me if I know anything about it. Incidentally, my mom taught me how to crochet when I was a little kid, and I told her I did. She asked me a few questions and I give her some answers, and she gives me a firm “thank you.” As I typically do, I respond, “no worries.” She then proceeds to absolutely eat into me about how that’s not “proper english” and some absolute baby boomer bullshit about how “millennials and their made up words” and how I was at my job and I should speak “correctly.” I just nod politely, not in the mood to interact with this human cross over between Mrs. Clause and the actual devil. I think this angered her more, and she purses her non-existent lips into what can only be described as an angry butthole, and repeats her main points again, sparknotes version. I shouldn’t speak “like an illiterate” at my work, etc. Whatever lady. I’ve finished scanning her items and coupons (of fucking course she had coupons) and I happily tell her her total. She puts her card in the machine, I put the receipt in the bag, yadda yadda, and hand her the bag, telling her to have a wonderful day. She gives me a half-assed “thank you.”

2019-02-18 19:25:20+00:00,2447,Steal from me and ignore lawyers? Hope you enjoy your new website,nascentia,"In late 2017, my wife got a great job offer / promotion within her current company but it meant moving across the state. Within a month. We scrambled, sold our home the day it was listed, found a rental which accepted pets, packed, and moved nearly 4 hours away in a span of ten days.   
  
We got really lucky with the rental - they were OK with four pets, house was nice, location was good, and they accepted my offer of a three-month lease at a higher rent rate. Everything was fantastic while we lived there. We bought a new home and moved out at the end of our lease thinking everything was fine.  
  Nope. The property management company, which WAS licensed and legitimate, decided that they didn't want to follow state law and return our security deposit.   
  
I spent months going back and forth with them before getting not one but two lawyers involved, as well as filing a formal complaint with the state division of real estate against their license. I was pretty frustrated to discover that whether I went with small claims court (under $5,000 in my state) or our actual attorney, we'd foot the bill up front with no guarantee of getting our settlement even if we won our air-tight case. The legal fees would deplete almost all of what we're owed.  
  
But today I got fed up. I decided to check to see if the property manager's domain name was available, but as a .co instead of their .com. SUCCESS! So now, for the low price of $12/year, I've set up a site as ""shittypropertymanagername.co"" (not the actual site) and posted screenshots of my correspondence with the state investigators and with my lawyers, all private info. redacted, and stuck 100% to accurate, verifiable facts with no hyperbole so they can't claim a whiff of slander. Hand-wrote the (shitty) HTML as well so no code or IP theft from their actual site. Hope they enjoy the new listing about them being thieves who can't follow state law popping up on google and any typos going to MY page instead of theirs.

2019-02-17 10:52:30+00:00,2224,Someone stole my drier. I gave him a quest.,Dastey,"So all these drier stories over the past couple of days reminded me of my own story when I was living in a dorm during my time at university.

There was about 190 apartments at the dorm I lived in and we shared 12 washing machines and 4 driers.

This one time I go wash my clothes and I always make sure to time it so I come atleast 5 minutes prior to the wash being done as there had been reports of clothes being stolen.

I check the driers and 1 is empty so I put my wet clothes into the drier. I notice it will take roughly 50 minutes for the drier to be done so I set a timer for 45 minutes later.

After 40 minutes I start leaving my apartment and head over to the laundry house only to notice that my clothes are in one of the laundry baskets and it is still soaking wet. Someone had decided to stop the drier and put his own in while mine was still stinking, wet and needing another round in the drier.

Petty revenge time. I was furious since not only was I a poor student who now had to pay again but also for wasting my time. So I stop the drier and put my own clothes in and take his out of the drier. I then decide to give him a quest of finding and picking up his clothes, so I take it all and spread it nicely across the entire laundry house leaving him to pick it all up one by one.

I come back 40 minutes later with my laundry still in the drier and his still spread outside the laundry house. A few people may have noticed me spreading his clothes outside but nobody ever said anything to me about it.

tl;dr: Some guy stops the drier shortly after I put mine in, I come back to wet clothes, I take his clothes out and throws it outside.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/arjjuk/someone_stole_my_drier_i_gave_him_a_quest/,pettyrevenge,93,0.0
2018-09-30 14:25:33+00:00,2873,"Abuse your wait staff and be a super jagoff, you get embarrassed.",Rdubdanger,"Was at a casual, sports oriented wing restaurant in Ohio last night.  The restaurant literally has about 50 TVs all over the place.
At about 7:20 pm the manager  goes around and changes the TVs on the outside walls to the Ohio State game, and left the TVs around the top of the bar on the late afternoon games that were finishing up.
Now, if you know anything about Ohio, pretty much the Buckeyes are all we have to give us joy.   We love the Bucks, and this restaurant was packed specifically by people who came to watch the game.

Suddenly, one guy, mid 30s, looks like a less put together version of the every-dads in Kohls ads stops the manager and says, “Does THIS have to be on every TV?” Loud enough that I heard him the next table over.
The manager was very nice, he said, “I left the other games over the bar, but would be happy to put whatever game you want on one of these” ( pointing to TVs near him)
The guy says, “no I mean can you put something not SPORTS related on some of these TVs?”  (Smarmy as hell and loud).
Manager says “ well during football season, this is kind of our thing, and generally the people are coming here come for the games, especially the Buckeyes” ( again very nice)
Guy then gets louder, “ Your management style is SHIT! Explain this to your waitress when I dont tip her and never come back”
By now people are looking.  Manager, again, apologized and offer to comp an app and dessert.
The guy ACTUALLY holds up his hand in “talk to the hand” fashion and starts repeating “begone! Begone begone!”
I was like, WOW!
Our check came and we were leaving to go home for the game, I could see the guy had upset the server who was a very young college student who had done a terrific job for us.  I pulled her aside and told her look, I am watching this guy be an idiot to you, he already told the manager he isnt going to tip you because he doesnt like that football is on TV.  

I said, “ here is the plan, if you promise me he will get cold foood and limited drink refills, I will tip you double to make up for his douche baggery”
She smiled and agreed. I tipped her 30%.

On the way out, and I probably shouldnt have, I stopped at his table, and said louder than I should have, “hey, dont worry about the tip you said you were not going to leave for the waitress , I took care of it for you and tipped her double , you cheap, asshole”

The whole section of tables had an eye on the guy due to his behaviors, and a collective laugh /cheer went out as I walked away knowing he was about to have the worst  restaurant experience ever.

2018-09-29 07:38:24+00:00,2865,Let Me Rewash The Clothes For You,micumpleanoseshoy,"Not usually a petty person but this one girl really ticks me off.

My apartment building has a laundry room for tenants to use so most units do not have their own washing machine. I try not to do my laundry on weekends as there are usually long que of every goddamn washing machine in the room (and we only have 5 washer and 5 dryers for three 27 floored blocks).

Anyways, I usually start the laundry and set my alarm to 10 minutes before it's done. I head back up to my unit to do else things and come back down to wait out final minutes. Did that too because I don't like to hold up the line or have someone takes out my clothes and dumps it on the floor.

It's weekends and the line is pretty long. When I got back down, my clothes were outside the machine, half washed. There are still soap suds on it. Obviously someone had turn the machine off halfway, get my clothes out (bitch, my laundry basket is right in front the machine, was it hard for you to get the clothes into the basket instead of puttin it on top of the machine?) and dump hers into it. 

Asked the lady using the machine next to me and she said a girl turned the machine off halfway throughout washing. Since rinsing takes only a couple minutes (maximum 15 minutes),I stopped the machine, get mine done with the same machine and set hers back to washing...for 3 hours. One and a half hour of just washing before it rinse and spin to dry.

On top of that, I add in more detergent so there's no chance in hell you can stop the washing halfway with the overflowing soap bubbles. 

When I got down to get my clothes from the dryer half an hour after, that girl was standing in front of the washer with an angry AF face and was guarding the machine like its her most prized possession. Not only she could not stop the washing, the soap bubbles was overflowing out from the machine due to the huge amount of detergent I had put into her washing.

Seriously, don't cut the fucking line and interfere with my laundry washig next time, shithead.

The best part is, she is not supposed to use the machine after me. She had jumped the line and stopped my washing halfway.

We always had an issue keeping bartenders for an assortment of weird reasons, so myself and another guy worked behind the bar about 40-45 hours a week. Not too long ago, I went back to school full time, just in time for them to hire a new guy to take my hours. 

J, as he'll go by, was a shit bartender, a serial liar, and an egomaniac. Imagine all the worst things that could possibly go wrong behind a bar, and make it an everyday thing. This guy accomplished maintaining an environment of shit and abject laziness for all two to three months we worked together. I was working WAY less, but every shift I came in after him, nothing was prepared. Glasses were dirty (but put away???), no fruit was cut or mixes made, and whole kegs were empty. It sucked working there as I was doing twice the work I was slated for EVERY shift. None of the managers really ever did anything about him either. He was a warm body, and that's really all they needed.

Soon enough, I put in my two weeks and had two shifts left. It was a Sunday morning where he'd closed the night before and lo and behold, everything is a catastrophic mess. I gave up. Didn't do anything my entire shift except for takeout orders. Left the bar the way he left it the night before and waited for him to come in for the night shift.

He's 30 minutes late, and as I'm ready to clock out one of the managers asks me why I haven't done anything.

""J did jack shit last night, when are you going to tell him to do his fucking job.""

So, J finally shows up, sees that nothing is done, flips shit and walks out of the restaurant. I clock out and start driving home.

2018-09-27 18:25:08+00:00,3054,The Queen of petty revenge and the wedding,junkfoodmama,"Because so many of y'all asked. Here is another story about my cousin The Queen of Petty Revenge. 

So the queen had a congenital disease that left her with a diminished mental capacity. Didn't stop her for sticking up for herself. In fact she had the toughest spine I had ever seen. The queen was also unlucky enough to have gotten a shit dad who remarried a just awful woman(AW for this story). The woman already had two girls and found my cousin to be a burden so they only saw the queen when they would take her to various church functions. Mostly just to keep keep up appearances with their church, if the congregation had known how they really treated the queen they would have been social pariahs. The queen didn't care though, she loved her dad. The queen was capable of true unconditional love, you could do anything and she would still love you. Her dad abused the shit out of this. 

This story is to the end of the queen's life. She had been on a steady decline for a couple years now and was pretty much always in a wheelchair. One of AW daughters was getting married to another member of the congregation and it was a BIG deal in the church. AW doesn't want the queen to be one of the bridesmaids, she is convinced that the queen will just be a distraction and that day should be all about HER BABY. So the queen is at one of the church functions that they had drug her to, when the **preacher** aproaches her and asks if she is going to be a bridemaid, right in front of AW. The queen very plainly answers ""No, she is afraid that I'm going to ruin the wedding"" pointing to AW. *The preacher looks horrified* AW starts trying spout off some stuff about being afraid that it would be too much for the queen to handle health wise. The queen knows how to up the ante and starts crying. Saying how she just really wanted to be a part of the wedding also. That she loved her sister and sisters are SUPPOSED to be bridesmaids. AW can't fight this and agrees to let her be a bridesmaids to save face. 

So it's wedding day. The queen is a bridesmaid she has a dress but has been pretty much left out of all wedding events, including bridal shower and bachelorette party. She doesn't care though all she wants to do is be up at the front of the church, apart of the family. Hair and makeup gets done and everyone is in their dresses and the photographer comes in the do the photos of the bridal party. The queen is having a hard time standing so she was in her wheelchair. The bride and MOH (the brides sister) start complaining that the queen is pulling the focus of the shots. The photographer trying to appease them suggest that everybody sit down on this couch to take pictures. That way it's not just my cousin sitting. They do this for a few min, then pass out champagne glasses for some shots of them 'toasting' the bride. MOH starts in on the complaining again about how the dresses look weird sitting and that everything it's just more difficult because of the queen. Now the queen doesn't take shit from anybody, no matter what day it is. So the queen calls the MOH over closer and shouts ""HEY MOH NAME, WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP"" and throws her drink right into the MOH face. Shit. Went. Crazy. There were alot of arguments and the queen almost got kicked out of the wedding but they decided for appearances sake they would allow the queen to stay in the wedding. MOH got her makeup redone and the ceremony went off without a hitch. The reception had alot of little petty drama. The queen ""accidentally"" rolled over the brides train leaving tire tracks. I'm proud to say the queen left her mark! 

 It's nice writing these stories about the queen. It helps remind how fierce and fearless she was. I hope to bring just a fraction of that to my life. All Hail the Queen! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9jfcww/the_queen_of_petty_revenge_and_the_wedding/,pettyrevenge,100,0.0

There I am, staring off into the middle distance (before smart phones were ubiquitous), when a “gentleman” enters the train and stands too close to me. Like juuuuust gently brushing against me. He wasn’t leering at me or even looking at me, but If I shuffled away slightly he’d be standing next to me again a few seconds later. Now there was plenty of room on this train, the next standing person was maybe 3 feet away, so this was deliberate creeping. 

By the time I was sure this was deliberate, we were pulling up to my stop. We were right next to the doors. I was worried he was going to follow me out, especially since it was still dark. 

Then I felt it my opportunity present itself. That itchy feeling in my face. I knew what I had to do. 

As we pulled up to the station, and the doors slid open, I looked at him in the face for the first time. He kinda indirectly looked me, his eyes not meeting mine but his face turned toward me. 

And I sneezed a huge sneeze straight in his face. I really played it up too. Made sure there was lots of spit flying. 

Then I slipped out the doors just as they were shutting.

There was a night club we used to frequent, and I once received a text message saying we would get 4 free beers for that night after a GBP 10 entry fee.

For some reason, I looked at them (normally I would just head in), and there were basically 4 vouchers saying buy 1 get 1 free. 

I was pissed as I only came out on the promise of free alcohol, and since entry fees were normally GBP 5 for a student night. I asked the promoter stood there, and she just shrugged saying it was what it was. 

Pissed, I decided to walk out right there and then, and spent the next half hour informing everyone lining up to forget about the free beer. This basically killed their night, and unknown to me, the promoters had called the police citing a 'dangerous person'. 

I was approached by an officer, and I explained myself, and my reason for pointing out their deception, and showed him the text message that clearly said what I claimed. The officer was understanding, and went beyond his call of duty to basically tell the promoters off, and asked them to not accept any entries for the night, or he would be back.

He can quote the entire LOTR trilogy from start to finish, makes a point of hitting the midnight premiers of the newest Marvel and Star Wars movies, loves to read up on every latest scrap of leaked set photos/plot points he can....you get the idea. My other siblings and I enjoy those movies too, but we see them when time allows - usually a few days or even weeks after release. I think LB saw Infinity War 4 times in theaters before I saw it once. That said, LB is EXTREMELY good about keeping all spoilers to himself until everyone has seen the movie in question, and he HATES it when people give any plot points away.

On to the petty revenge set-up: LB saw The Force Awakens at an early premier when it first came out. Litterally the first or one of the first showings in the USA. He loved it, and could not stop bugging us about going to see it so he could finally talk about the movie with us. My Other Brother (OB) caves and decides he'll change his plans so he can go the following weekend with LB. About mid-week, LB hits up OB and has this conversation:

OB: Yeah that's what I heard, but I already know what happens.

LB: WHAT?! HOW?!!

OB: I was on instagram and some dude commented under ESPN's post that ""Han Solo dies""

LB: SHOW ME

Well sure enough, OB sent a screenshot of the comment in question. It was some random kid who probably thought it'd be funny to ruin one of the most awaited movie releases of the decade by spoiling it on a very public instagram page. LB is furious, but he had a plan.

The Petty Revenge: LB finds the spoiler's instagram account. Lo and behold, it's some highschool age looking kid with a public profile (you don't have to be friends with them to see their posts). He makes note of the username, and vows revenge. FYI this was December 2015. 2 years later, the next Star Wars movie (Last Jedi) is set to be released. What does LB do? He keeps tabs on mr spoiler's instagram account for 24 months until December 2017. LB of course goes to the very first first showing of The Last Jedi. As soon as the credits roll, LB fires up instagram and direct messages this kid all the spoilers from a burner account. A few months after that, he does it AGAIN for Infinty War. The kid made his account private after that.

TL;DR - Brother waits years to spoil huge movies for a random kid who spoiled the plot of Star Wars.

2018-09-19 12:54:43+00:00,2248,"Revenge on loud partying college students, featuring my dad and dog",blackswan45,"This occurred in the late 90's/early 2000s, when I was in grade school.  I grew up on a street that was mostly old houses from the 1910s, and most of them were huge.  Like built originally as single family homes, but massive enough to turn into apartments or studios.  Which is what a lot of landlords did, to make a decent profit off of the kids who went to the college about 6 blocks up the street.  I think typically 6-8 kids shared one house.  One such house was directly next door, and another was down and across the street.

There was a lot of turnover in these houses as you can imagine, and it always stressed my mom and dad out to see new kids moving in.  As an adult, I now understand why.  A few times we had some really chill, nice kids living next door.  And a few times, we had total assholes living there.

One year, it was assholes.  They were hard party types who didn't care if it was the middle of the week or the middle of the night to throw an insanely loud, rowdy house party.  And when I say loud, I mean that even with our houses being separated by a large yard, we could STILL hear their bass thumping from INSIDE our house.  Sometimes until three in the morning.  

Now my dad is one of the most laid back and passive people I know.  He always started by going next door himself to ask them to kindly keep it down.  This particular crowd basically blew him off and if I recall, had a few colorful words for him.  Ok, fine.  Police were called.  The policy at the time, iirc, was if the police were called three separate times over the same house, a complaint was launched automatically.  These kids literally did not care.  Well the complaint happened, and I assume the landlord gave them mild shit for it.  They quieted down for maybe a week or two, and started back up again.  I don't know how they didn't get evicted, other than the landlord cared more about money than keeping the peace in the neighborhood.  This went on all.  Fucking. Semester.  And to add to it all, the party goers would lob all their trash over the fence into OUR yard.  This include glass, which broke often.  Once there were broken beer bottles right under where my swing was.  Needless to say, my parents were not happy.  If either parent confronted these twats, they would be rude and unpleasant.  My mom began picking up their trash and throwing it back into their yard, for what good that did.

The morning after one particularly loud party,  I was out in the yard with my mom, and our dogs.  One of the dogs was a hound; this information will be relevant shortly.  I think my mom was picking up some of the trash.  It was mid-morning, and the party people were next door sleeping off their hangovers.  I had the idea of bringing one of my many pets out in its cage (honestly can't remember which one, I had a plethora of hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits growing up).  I would sometimes take the bottom off of the cages and let the critter enjoy the grass for a bit.  I did this, not thinking about our high prey drive hound being outside at the time.  He got really worked up upon seeing a small animal.  He started baying.  Loudly.

Now I'm thinking oh shit, the dog is making noise, gonna take the critter back inside.  My mom glanced over, saw what was going on, and said something along the lines of, ""leave the critter out here for a bit.""

So I kept it out of reach of the hound (who had to be on a long rope, as he would bolt and run off) and just sat there for a minute watching him incessantly bay over and over, before it dawned on me what my mom was doing.  Mind you, we were as close to this other house as we could be without going over the fence.  These hungover people were getting a rude awakening.  Plus, this was one night we had called cops.  They were going to have to deal with a complaint and their landlord when they got up.

Mom continued throwing trash over the fence back into their yard.  Dog bayed.  Critter didn't care; critter was safe under his cage and happily snacking on the grass.  I doubt any of the other neighbors would have cared, as we knew most of them and they had all been dealing with the same noise we had for months.  No one from the house ever came out but I know that dog made enough racket to wake them all up, hopefully feeling like crap.  That was the last rowdy party that house had until the end of the semester.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't find out about this next bit until I was well into adulthood.  Part two of this revenge includes my dad, who to his credit always tried to deal with these people civilly.  The victims of his revenge were in the house down the street.  They were so loud that half a block away we could still hear their music and yelling.  Except these people were meaner.  They got really crazy, and sometimes the parties got violent.  When my dad went to ask them to lower the noise level, they said not just nasty, but threatening things to him.  Same complaints to the cops, same b.s.  

After they kept us awake for the dozenth time, my dad went over to their absolutely trashed yard after dark.  With him, he had a crock pot of chili that had been neglected in the fridge for far too long.  My dad said it smelled and looked like vomit.  And lo, there was the motorcycle of one of the assholes, parked in the front yard, uncovered.  My dad liberated the rotten chili onto said bike.  He told me he peeked out the window a few times, and actually got to witness the glorious moment the bike owner came upon his defiled cycle.  The guy apparently actually PUT HIS HAND in this stuff and then proceeded to puke all over the lawn.  I'm sure he thought someone else had been sick on the bike.

No one ever cleaned off the bike, either.  It sat in the yard until it was nothing but rust.  I still consider my dad to be one of the most passive human beings on this earth, but it shows that everyone has their limit.  

Fortunately, afterwards both houses had decent kids every year until we moved away from that house.

2018-09-18 12:47:37+00:00,2398,Driver's a dick to a cyclist.,mikefergy4,"This one will be short. FTP here and all that jazz.

So this morning about an hour ago, I was in the right turning lane and a cyclist was ahead of me going slower than the guy riding my ass would have liked. So he honked and that pissed me off. Well all 3 of us made the turn, and both the other driver and I pass the cyclist before stopping at the next light. Well I see as we’re slowing down, the cyclist and other driver have some words through his window. I’m not happy with this prick and decide to stop pretty short of the light, and what does the driver do while not paying attention? Lightly tap my bumper with his Infinity. I motion him to pull over. By this time the cyclist is gone, but I can’t just let this guy go. He’s obviously in a hurry, and when we parked he comes flying out yelling at me that it was my fault. So I pretend to make a call to report it, and wait it out for 2-3 more minutes. Then I tell him to not be such an asshole as I left. Sorry but not great justice, I just made him 5-10 extra minutes late. Also my car’s old and didn’t have a scratch on it.

TL;DR Driver is an asshole to a cyclist, I make him late.

2018-09-17 15:37:25+00:00,6351,The only time I wanted a baby to keep crying on an airplane,coolbeansyoo,"Right as soon as we got on the plane I knew this guy was going to be trouble. Let’s call him Paul. 

Paul was blocking the walk way having half his body in the isle, rearranging his backpack for whatever reason (when no one was next to him and he could’ve just done this in his seat). No big deal, I’ll just wait for him to be done. Then Paul insists on me walking around him, which with him being half in the isle makes it quite hard. My body brushes up against his body which made him mad even though he told me to go through. Of course everyone else is trying to board the plane as well and are running into the same issue and Paul is taking his sweet sweet time. Whatever. My boyfriend and I got the row right behind him and sat down awaiting the plane to take off. 

Next offense is when someone is trying to put their bag in the overhead bin, and Paul goes ape shit. Starts yelling at this women that there is glass in his bag and that she can’t put her luggage there. She calmly tells Paul that this space is for everyone and she needs to put her bag there as is no more room in the other compartments. Paul’s wife doesn’t think this women is getting the point so they start yelling how they’re “custom wine glasses” and that she cannot put her bags there. I was giving this women props, she stood on the seat to gently rearrange things and kept her calm the entire time despite being yelled at. Of course this was not good enough for Paul and his wife, who kept muttering under their breath about how stupid she was and that she was going to ruin their glasses. 

When we finally get in the air the baby one row behind me (two rows behind Paul) starts crying. The baby wasn’t even crying 30 seconds before Paul decides to yell “Give that kid a bottle”. The parents obviously ignore this and calm down their child within a minute or so. Now throughout the flight the baby cried a couple more times, each time lasting no longer than 3 minutes. A very good baby. Paul however was not pleased and each time the baby cried he’d turn around and give the parents the stink eye then get up and walk around. I kept hoping the baby would cry just so he’d have to listen to it. 

I’m a very shy person so I wasn’t about to confront him, and my boyfriend (who was in the seat behind him) had his head phones on and wasn’t aware of what was going on. So I hatch a plan for my petty revenge, to make his plane ride as unpleasant as possible. What’d I do? I clued in my boyfriend on the situation and had him join my cause. He opened and shut the tray table multiple times “for his laptop”. He sat with his knees in Paul’s seat. He kept putting his water bottle in the pocket behind the seat and taking it out. I kept “accidentally” hitting his seat when I would go to cross my legs. I turned my ac on full blast and pointed it his way. I ate my chips as loud and slow as possible. I coughed multiple times very loudly. All of this would make Paul stare at us and then complain to his wife.

Hope you like me spoiling what you like too,Azrynix,"So my girlfriend and I recently moved into a new apartment in a new city. We inherited it from friends of a friend, but they didn't tell us much about the flatmate left behind. Things started off great, but gradually his bad habits started coming out. One of which is spoiling everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, he sees you interacting with.

He spoiled the Witcher 3 DLC that I had been avoiding spoilers of for years. Same with Dragon Age: Inquisition and it's DLC too. The worst by far was when he saw my girlfriend and I watching GLOW and stated that he hadn't started watching it yet. 3 days later, when we were nearing the season 2 finale, he spoiled it. He speed-watched it ahead of us and then spoiled it for us. 

So I decided to play off something he holds near and dear; his coke. He drinks at least 5 litres a day, and loves to leave the bottles all over the kitchen floor. So now I leave all of his coke bottles as loosely closed as possible so that all his drinks go flat. 

I also let his cheese slices go stale too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9ghqy6/you_like_spoiling_everything_im_watching_hope_you/,pettyrevenge,210,0.0
2018-09-16 15:36:25+00:00,3296,Tell me I'm cutting your fabric wrong? I'll cut it exactly how you want it,smebe,"LTL, FTP, on mobile, TL;DR at the end, you get me.

Context: I work in a crafts store that also has a fabric department. Customer brings up a bolt and asks for an amount, I cut it. I usually give at least an inch more than they ask for because sometimes the previous cut was diagonal or jagged or whatever. I also just like to be nice!

Yesterday, I hear the service bell ring and I walk over to take the order. Lo and behold, a co-worker from my department is here before her shift and wants some fabric cut.

Now I don't really enjoy Co-worker because she has a very... particular way of working. She changed a lot of things around to suit her style, and it makes it near impossible for me to do my job properly sometimes, but this is the fourth person that's been in my department in the span of a few months and unfortunately, she's been the best out of all of them. I just deal with her shit when I come in and do my job as best I can.

Anyway, Co-worker asks me to measure out the fabric and she says she can cut it herself. I tell her I'm more than willing to cut it, since I cut fabric for other employees all the time, no big deal! She gives me a large roll of mesh and asks if I'll cut a yard and a half for her.

Here's the offense: I start measuring, taking care to go over the amount like I always do. She immediately scolds me and tells me I'm doing it wrong. She says that I shouldn't start from zero and measure a half, she says I should put the edge at the yard mark and measure backwards. I was taught differently by a different employee, but okay, I say, I'll do it this way. She keeps telling me why I'm wrong and how I could've shorted her and she's the best. I hold my tongue and cut. I don't appreciate her being so condescending towards me, but I want to be done with this interaction.

She then asks for two and a half yards of a fleece bolt ""cut the exact same way"".

The revenge? I don't give her any extra. I put the edge of the fabric just a hair over the line, and I go slower than usual to boot. No extra for you, Co-worker! That inch is reserved for a polite customer!

TL;DR a co-worker of mine bitches that I don't cut fabric right so I don't give her any extra fabric and make her wait longer to get her cut.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9gbgbx/tell_me_im_cutting_your_fabric_wrong_ill_cut_it/,pettyrevenge,118,0.0
2018-09-15 19:59:15+00:00,3454,Bitch about getting asked for ID and it will be neverending.,readersanon,"This is going to be a short one. 

I work in a convenience store, and I have for the last 5 years. Once we card the same people a few times we learn to remember them and don't ID them afterwards. But I work in two different stores, and I go to university as well. I also am often working different shifts (morning, night, restocking) and so I come across a lot of different people in a high traffic store. This means that sometimes I will card regular customers because I don't recognize them. 

One night I was working and a girl that looked vaguely familiar comes up to the cash with alcohol. I ask for her ID and she makes a face and bitches about it while handing over her ID. Normally I don't bother looking at the expiration date on the card and only at the date of birth, but since this card was extremely faded it prompted me to check. Lo and behold the card was expired. I refused the card as the law states to do so(which I find ridiculous as an expiration date does not change the date of birth). 

She goes out to her car and comes back with a valid ID and so I proceed with the sale. She then bitches at me for carding her even though she comes in every day. I've seen her two more times since that day and I've carded her both times, and I will continue to do so every time I see her.

2018-09-15 07:53:12+00:00,6171,My worst first date,sunnykl,"So this is a bit of a shaggy dog story, and the petty revenge isn't even mine. 

I got asked out by a seemingly decent dude who was introduced to me at the main campus eatery. He was cute and I was down with it. I informed him I was a vegetarian, and he didn't blink at it. 

He picked me up on a Friday night and we drove about an hour outside the city. It was strangely quiet the whole way. I tried to start conversation more than once, but it went nowhere. All attempts to start conversation went single word shutdown. 

We get to a steak house. Note: vegetarian. I'm not actually all that upset at steak house as most will feed me a potato and sides. It's not the best option, but I can eat.

We get seated. He has a two-for-one coupon. He presents it. He tries to order for me (meat; does not go well). He has yet to speak to me at all. It is really awkward. Dead silence nobody is talking awkward,

The server, a very nice person, offers me a plate of all the sides given I'm veggie and she's really nice. Nope. Dude demands two steaks and my steak packed in a doggie bag and I should be given the sides. I... am confused and wish I was not there, but so it goes. There continues to be dead silence. I try to start conversation more than once, but it fails with one word answers.

He tosses a fit when my plate shows up, sans meat, with every side the place has. It's a really nice plate of mac and cheese, broccoli, rice, asparagus and more. I'm told ""compliments of the chef."" He has a shit fit that he didn't get these sides with his steak. He eventually works himself up to a storm out and leaves me an hour from my dorm with no way to get home.

The really nice people who worked there found me a ride home and in the pettiest of revenge ""never saw"" the coupon he claimed when they reported his dine and dash to the local police. He eventually paid the whole thing (including the cheesecake they fed me because it was a terrible date and they let me sit in the staff room in the back) because he didn't want this on his record.

2018-09-13 20:19:44+00:00,2525,Nope sorry I just don't remember you,Tessamari,"In my early years as a nurse I worked in a prison. Initially I had a DON who was the best.  She retired and was replaced by the DONfromHELL. DFH hearafter. DFH was simply a vile and hateful woman. Just the worst human I had experienced in a position of power. She was a wrinkled crone to boot, which is beside the point except to clarify that she was ugly inside and out.  The woman took great joy in making any and all in her scope as miserable as possible. Eventually I left her scope.  As is typical of the public sector she was promoted. Again I was under her scope.  As soon as she figured it out she did everything she could to make me miserable again. I left. Fast forward 20 plus years.  I am working in a small rehab facility. I recognize DFH, now retired and with broken hip requiring rehab. She is now my patient and while having this gnarled crone as DON was bad enough, having her as patient was potentially worse. I immediately made notice that I would not participate in her care and why.  Current management was understanding of my issues and agreed I would not be subjected to doing her care.  She recognized me one day while I was giving a patient medication in the common rehab gym.  She said to me, ""remember me Tessamari, I was your DFH?""  I smiled my best smile and looked at her deeply for a minute and said, ""I am sorry, I can't seem to place you, where is it you were my DFH?""  She puffed up and sputtered just a tad and explained our prior association. I pasted a puzzled expression on my face.  Well, yes I did work there, I recall several folks with whom I worked there and all, what a great time we had! But..but I just can't recall you.  Hmm... how odd.  I kept this charade up for the entirety of her stay there, never quite able to recall her.  This irritated the piss out of her. Absolutely pushed her to the point of apoplexy at least once.

On my way home, the train was packed and not a seat was open. That's ok, I'm pretty used to it, but I am keeping my eyes open for people vacating their seats. Meanwhile, there's a couple also standing next to me.

I've been standing for about 3 long (express) stops now (out of an 8 stops commute) when finally someone 2 seats over from where I'm standing stood up in preparation to exit the next station. 

Now, usually at this point, most people would know to let me sit down. I would also usually gratefully accept, unless I'm already about 1 or 2 stops away, then I'll just stay standing, but nope, the guy blocked me and have the girl sat down instead.

A bit flabbergasted at this, but ok no worries. More people usually got off at this station and lo and behold, a person across from the girl also stood up to leave. I made my way to that seat, and the guys then also tried to take this seat!! Another seat next to the one I was going for also opened up so he relented and let me sit and sat next to me. So now they had to continue the conversation across the aisle (it's an NYC train so it's a pretty big gap). 

Usually, I would actually offered to switch seat so people who are obviously commuting together can sit together, but nope I decided to just let them be.

EVEN BETTER, the seat to the other side of me opened up in the next stop, and the girl moved and sat next to me. Now they have to lean forward and talk over me.

The problem with Tim was although he loved to orchestrate pranks on other people, if you played a prank on him, he would not take it like an adult.  

One time he bought a living room set and left it on a friend’s lawn.  My buddy had to find someone with a truck and haul into the dump and get rid of it.   A lot of his pranks either involved an expense to the victim or a major inconvenience.

One day, he signed up my primary email account and phone number with everything he could find.   I started getting spam and phone calls constantly.   I had to either block or unsubscribe to a lot of things. It ended up taking months to clear up.   He put confetti in my air vents in my new car.

So, one day I took out some ads online and in the paper advertising his house for sale.   I added that the seller was leaving the country very soon and needed to sell quickly and listed it at $20,000 below the market price.  His phone basically exploded for the next two weeks.  Constant calls and his voice mail was full regardless of what he did to clean it.  He was getting 100+ emails a day as well.

He was furious.   Why would anybody do that to him???  After this be agreed that all of the pranks would stop.  True to his word they have but he still plays the victim card about how I took it too far......

I live in the city, but the city is surrounded by mountains and i live pretty high up towards one of the mountains which has the most popular hiking routes.

After building our house, including our parking space, we noticed that sometimes people were parking in our private parking spot, the private parking sign wasnt glaringly visible so we thought that might have been the case. After putting up 2 more signs (now 4 total) and marking the space with ""private parking"", people still ended up parking there, although much less. In order to park there you had to drive into our private driveway and park right in front of our house, there was no chance you ended up parking there without knowing that this was not a private parking. 


So, this summer we have had two cars who have parked there on several occasions, i ended up getting tired of them blocking my driveway and decided to do something about it.


We parked our car right behind their car, essentially blocking it, and went inside to make dinner. We eventually got a call from the owner of the car, she wanted us to move the car so she could get out. I told her i was on a business trip and would be back tomorrow morning, she ended up taking a taxi home and meeting me the next morning to collect her car.

Monday morning, driving to work. Traffic is moving slowly on route 7, but not stop and go. And of course, I've got some twat riding my ass like I've got the option to go faster... Not surprisingly, this guy is in a luxury vehicle (Audi sedan, I believe) with the classic Virginia ""Don't Tread On Me"" plates. Nothing says ""I'm an entitled cunt who drives like an prick"" more than that combination.

Anyways... The right lane is moving faster than the left lane, so I put on my signal and get start to merge. The troglodyte behind me decides now's his chance and, without a signal, tries to overtake me when I'm halfway into the right lane. Well, he can't quite make it without hitting a guard rail so he slams on his brakes, then the horn. I give him the finger, he gives me the finger, we both mouth off at each other and continue driving. Pretty typical morning commute so far.

Well, this guy decides to stay even closer on my ass now. As much I'd like to slow down to fuck with the guy, that's only going to make traffic even worse for everybody else. Oh well. I'll deal with it. As I said, this is pretty much a daily thing in the DC area. Every now and then, he throws his arms up in frustration with traffic. And in between his tantrums, he takes a sip of coffee from his cup. That's right... a CUP. Not a thermos. An open-topped CUP like it's fucking 1970 or some shit. It's cold as a witch's tit outside, so you know that coffee is nice and hot. Perfect.

So now, I leave a good amount of room between me and the next car, prompting my new friend to get real upset. He gets right up on my ass for about a quarter mile, then brings his coffee cup up to his lips. So what do I do? Brake check that mother fucker. His eyes went wide as saucers, slammed on his own brakes, and in the process spilled coffee all over the front of his suit. This guy goes nuclear. Laughing like a maniac, I'm able to get over and away from him into a faster lane, which I'm sure made him all the more angry. Eventually, he caught up and pulls up next to me screaming, saying god knows what. I give him a big smile and raise my coffee thermos up, fitted tightly with a screw-on top.

2018-09-06 18:31:02+00:00,4107,Guys Wouldn't Get Off My Tennis Court While I Was Teaching,Gas_Ass_Trophy,"So I used to teach tennis for the park district. At this particular park, there were two separate pairs of tennis courts at opposite ends of the field. One set was freshly paved while the other set was cracked up and needed repair. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm to teach class to middle schoolers and arrive 10 minutes before the scheduled class on the nice courts. There are two middle-aged men playing and I tell them that I need both courts and that they belong to the park district. They refuse saying that they got there first. We get into an argument but the kids have all arrived and I'm like fine, whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we hop on the court and I set up a drill have to hit a sharp angled cross-court shot within the deuce side service box into the opposing deuce side service box. Basically, every ball that was hit rolled over into the other court that these men wouldn't leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Then they come over to me yelling that I'm intentionally doing that. I just said it's all part of the lesson and they're kids and can't control their aim that well. I agree that I'll start a new drill that is down the line, secretlyhh with the intention to occasionally hit one into their court every now and then. However, my part here was done as the middle-schoolers caught on to what was happening.  The kids started hitting all of their balls into their court on purpose. They would even pick up balls on the ground just to hit them over.

&amp;#x200B;

Now these guys are furious and start yelling at me even more and I'm just like, there are two courts on the other side of the park. They got left and made the long walk over. I've never bonded so closely with my students, it was hilarious. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9dljm2/guys_wouldnt_get_off_my_tennis_court_while_i_was/,pettyrevenge,127,0.0
2018-09-06 05:04:28+00:00,5666,"Oh, my final is too long?",VenusSmurf,"This is very petty, if also short. 

Classes started a few weeks ago at my university. One of the classes I teach is a required 101 course, and on the first day, a freshman girl sauntered in ten minutes late, pushed her way to a seat in the back, and immediately got on her phone. I asked for her name, which she gave without even making eye contact, as she was still on her phone. (I'm not uptight about phones the first day, though they're banned after that.)

A few minutes later, I started going through the assignment requirements. No actual final (I don't believe in them), but there's an eight page paper instead. 

At this, the girl groaned very loudly in disgust and insisted, ""Make it four. I'm not writing eight pages!""

Someone clearly didn't know how to adult yet, but I just smiled and said, ""My final paper is eight pages. If you don't want to write that, there's another 101 course next door right now, and that teacher's requirements are different. I'm fairly certain that's the last class with open seats.""

She made a face that was the equivalent of the middle finger and left.

I hadn't lied. That WAS the last class with open seats, but only because the instructor is a harpy who can't teach and doesn't care if everyone fails as long as she gets paid. She keeps her job by keeping her lips plastered to the department chair's rear but has the worst rating in the department. 

Also, not only does she have an actual final exam AND a final paper, but her paper is twelve pages.

2018-09-05 05:49:36+00:00,2025,"The customer is always right, it's the law?",Manicdeepression,"Sorry on phone, whatever that means, format, blah blah woof.

One of the benefits of being a barber for many decades is listening to old guys talk about the good old days. You know when DDT was freely dispursed, PTOs were ripping limbs from farm kids and various war stories. One of the drawbacks is listening to old guys talk. 

I'm usually open-minded to all walks of life and find differing opinions are interesting to hear. Unless I'm being fed a regurgitated Fox and Friends or Alex Jones broadcasts being passed off as someone's original thought. I usually just keep repeating ""Is that right"" or ""If you say so"" over and over until they leave. I learned a long time ago some old guys are too set in their ways to bother having any real debate. I learned this from pissing off a lot of old guys.

Cue bitchy old guy. BOG had an agenda. He went right past the usual football, weather, how long you been here small talk and it was politics. I got the feeling I had offended one of his coffee club buddies in the past and his real purpose was to bat clean-up (4th at bat to clear the bases). Something was off with his affect and the conversation became very forced/pointed, not organic.

While I'm clippering away he states a question ""you would agree that . . .""  Sorry I can't remember his exact question, but I do know that I didn't agree and said so, as politely as I could. I abhore people putting words in my mouth. When he again started ""well you would agree with . . .(total bullshit)"" the bile began building in the back of my mouth and again sorry I can't remember what he said, but no I didn't agree AT ALL and said so, not so nice this time tone. 

By now I see what's up, he's trying to get me to agree to a pretext of premises that will lead to the grand enlightenment that my simple mind will of course be forced to understand, he's channeling Alex Jones. When he gets to the third example, before he can expect agreement I state ""Why would you think that? That doesn't make any sense"". Strike three and BOG didn't like being derailed, he can't have his aha moment if I don't agree with 1,2 or 3.

In the span of five minutes BOG has gone from smirky know-it-all to nearly purple, really noticable with white hair. He jumps out of the chair and spins to face me. I've seen that look before and know he's about to throw a punch, but he freezes and batters me with the death stare instead. I ask him if he's done, more death stares, again I ask if he's done, nothing but rage. I tell myself he's done so I reach over his shoulder to undo the cutting cape. He has a phone out, he's been recording the whole time. He does some fumbling with the phone, puts it to his ear and starts talking to 911.  

OMG this constitutes an emergency to BOG. This was new territory, I've seen people use the police to fight their battles before, but this absolutely floored me. I was clueless as to what law I must have broken and I've taken law classes. I was willing to let BOG have his tantrum, leave with half a haircut and tell his coffee club buddies what an asshole I am, it's true I am, but call the cops? 

I tell him loud enough for 911 and neighbors to hear to get out of my shop. I helped him out the door at the same time. He sat in his car, with his wife, still on the phone. A few minutes go by and they both get out and are standing in my parking lot, still on the phone. I am getting madder by the minute at this entitled snowflake so I go out to yank his chain, hopefully he'll swing at me. I take out my fancy flip phone and take a close-up photo of him, he tells this to the police, additional charges? I go back inside and wait for the fuzz. 

I don't get uni's, I get two detectives at my door, this is serious business. After hearing BOG's complaint they both come inside and ask me what happened, it took me 30 seconds to explain everything. Then I was asked why I took his picture, I said he didn't pay for his haircut.  ""He didn't pay for his haircut?""
""Nope"". (Not really a reason but. . .)

They both left without saying a word. A minute or so later they return with BOG and make him pay $10 for the haircut. Apparently the *""customer is always right""* is not a reason to bother the police after all and they were not happy with him.

TL:DR; I didn't agree with bitchy old guy who thought money in hand meant customer is always right is some kind of law the police would enforce. Instead found out there's law that one has to pay for services rendered. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9d3irw/the_customer_is_always_right_its_the_law/,pettyrevenge,112,0.0

A big group of nurses, techs, respiratory therapists, X-ray people and a menagerie of others worked the night shift in the ICU, and hung out together night after night like we were sitting around a campfire, great camaraderie. 

One Respiratory therapist told me how when he worked day shift, this elitist nurse always went out of her way to be mean and disrespectful to him. He just despised this nurse. 

He observed that every time that nurse washed her hands(which was very frequently) she would ritualistically pull out her own special perfumed lotion and put it on. 

He saw the lotion unattended, grabbed it. Then he injected into the opening a few cc’s of a drug called mucomyst. He gave it a good shake and returned it. Mucomyst smells like terrible rotten eggs mixed with aged farts. 

Then he watched all day long as this nurse washed her hands, would go through her perfume lotion ritual and then smelled her hands. She then made a sour face rewashed her hands. She then repeated this over and over all day long.

My older sister is one year older than me, so when we were kids she would think she was the boss of me. 

She'd constantly play with my toys and never clean up after, then make me do it. Sometimes she'd tell me to do her chores, and I did them or else they wouldn't get done. (And if they didn't get done my mom would be pissed)

Well one day she did something so awful. She left out my Bratz dolls in the living room and I got in shit for it, so I had to clean them up on top of punishment chores. My mom didn't care about petty childhood politics, so she didn't care when I said it wasn't my mess.

I was so mad. I only know one other time I got this mad (again, by the hands of my sister. But that's a different story) I was furious. Seeing red, as they say. Red sauce. 

You see, I am very teeny tiny. 5'1 and 98 pounds at 20, you can imagine I was even smaller as a child. So I had to resort to indirect justice.

I don't know why I put hot sauce in her bed. Thinking back, it's just a bizzare thing to do. But I was pissed and couldn't just punch her so I just... Grabbed a bottle of franks and poured it everywhere over her sheets and under her pillow. I think I was hoping she wouldn't notice and then get hot sauce in her eyes or something.

Well it turns out she didn't notice, she felt her bed was damp later but the truth was so nuts her brain didn't connect that spicy smell + damp sheets = hot sauce in the bed. 

So, she slept in it. And she was so lazy she didn't do laundry for at least another for days. Sleeping in her hot sauce bed. 

I never got in trouble for it, and I didn't tell her until years later. We still have a laugh about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9c4vsg/i_put_hot_sauce_in_my_sisters_bed/,pettyrevenge,138,0.0

I'm bisexual and when I first started working here as a graphic designer I found really fast that I couldn't be open about having a girlfriend, I would have to lie and say I had a boyfriend or else my co-workers would attempt to set me up with their sons... So I built up a reputation for being straight, which is ok because it's work, but I noticed that people I work with and my Boss can be really homophobic even though I work for a corporation. Like for example my boss said they were getting tired of working with this gay guy (luckily she wasn't his boss but he did end up leaving). Or we were having an event with the Absolut Vodka people and we needed a photo of all their bottles, and she saw one that was for Gay Pride Month and said, ""Oh why do they have to ruin everything?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this there are a few gay couples who are our clients and co-workers and my boss will talk bad about their ""lifestyle choices"" and claim that it should be legal to discriminate against them.

Of course on the day I’m off something exciting happens. This lady is going through the checkout and for whatever reason decides to start ripping the poor cashier a new one. Cashier is upset but continues to check her out because she doesn’t have much of a choice. Timmy happened to be bagging her groceries and oopsied the package of cupcakes the lady was buying into the bag upside down.   
Lady doesn’t notice immediately and winds up coming back to the customer service desk screaming for blood. The manager calls Timmy over and he has the most perfect look of blank innocence on his face as he ambles over.

I proceeded to stand as tight up against the table so she couldn't get access to her purse to put her phone away.  When she walked away I would back off and just watch waiting for her to come back and pretend like I needed to adjust my songs and playlist every time she came back to put her phone away.  She finally just left her phone on the table but shortly after came back to grab it and kept waiting for me to move which, I didn't need to dance or anything so I stayed put.

I continue, “Hey I know you can hear me.” Without missing a beat she boards the bus before everyone else.

2018-08-25 22:24:47+00:00,2729,"I could have been the adult in the situation, but tbh, these kids are assholes...",DovahBah,"**A little background before I start:**  
Late last year my family helped out some friends of their by letting them move in. They wound up staying permanently instead of leaving when they were supposed to. The people's children (10f + 8m) are absolutely the most disrespectful little shits I've ever met. They lie about everything, start drama in the house with these lies, steal, and they're mean to my retardedly sweet german shepherd. Despite this, family says ""be patient with them, dovahbah. They're just kids. Speak with the parents."" I always speak with the parents, and they always enable the child's behavior.  

&amp;#x200B;

**What happened:** 

Early this morning I caught the boy doing something a family member asked them not to do, so I said (very politely, might I add) ""Hey, kiddo! Didn't (family member) ask you not to do that?"" Left it at that and went about my business. In the next room, plain as day, I hear him mocking me, then insulting me. Being that today was already a day of high stress due to a certain happening, I couldn't let this go unpunished. 

I noticed the kids were both watching Hulu, and unfortunately for them I have the Hulu app on my phone. I opened it and started changing the app being used, sending the volume to my phone, going to the homescreen, etc. The boy believes the girl is messing with him as it's ""his turn"" (no one gave them permission to use my television today, nor family member's Roku), so he begins screaming at her. Her, having done nothing, screams at him. They begin fighting, tell their parents on one another, get yelled at by their parents, then go back into the living room crying. 

Once the boy realizes girl isn't lying about messing with the Roku, they're now both worried they broke it. They turn it off and switch it to cable. Again, unfortunately for them, I have the DirecTV remote on my phone as well. About 45 minutes of changing channels, turning the box off, going to the menu, and etc, they get up and tell me that the cable box is acting up. I assure them the cable box is fine because ""I don't see anything wrong. Everything looks good. If you guys broke my TV though, since you said Roku was doing it too, imagine how mad your parents are going to be when I give them the bill for my TV....""  

Not too bright, they go into the room and tell on each other that they broke the TV. Arguing ensues about who used it last, what they did, and what ""broke it"", and eventually they're yelled at, spanked, and grounded. 

Now, the living room is free, there's no screaming in there like there always is, and revenge was served. 

Part of me feels like ""way to be an adult about it"", but overall, I'm sick of these disrespectful little shits, and their horrible parents. If I had the money to move, I would, but til then... that Hulu and DirecTV app is going to keep making appearances.

Most of the people are pretty cool, but the guy I work closest with (lets call him P) is a total asshole.   The kind of guy who will look you in the eye when you're asking him for help and then just look back at his screen like you don't even exist.  

Me and P never really got on from the get go, he had been with the company a long time (15 years+) and I came along and he resented me from the start. He's good buddies (and neighbours) with our manager, so I could never really say much in my own defense in the early days. I think it was also down to the fact I didn't have any real experience at the time and he just wasn't the kind of person that was used to having to help people, either way he treated me like shit all day every day.

Anyway, fast forward 18 months into this job and it's March 2017.  In March every year there is a big horse racing event in a town near to where I work, and P, being a big gambler and actually working a second job at the race course, wants to take some time  off the same 3 days as he does every year to go to this event.
He usually does this only a month or so in advance, couldn't tell you why.  

Right around the time I knew he would be wanting to book this time off, P decides to take his shithousery up a notch and calls me out in front of the whole team for texting my girlfriend when im in work.  The day before, he spent almost 2 hours watching horseracing on his phone.  Needless to say, I told him to go fuck himself and called him out on his crap.

Later that day I checked the holiday rota and realised P hadn't actually booked off his annual horserace event.  You can bet your ass I took the opportunity to take those days for myself, and as we weren't both allowed to take leave at the same time, he had to work those days while I sat around my house for 3 days eating, drinking and playing video games.

I take classes in the morning and afternoon so when I work it's usually a closing shift (only working 15 hours a week, full time student). 

The only issue is I close by myself so it really toys with my anxiety whenever I get a rush, or can't finish certain duties by a certain time, etc. So by the end of the night I'm usually so out of it mentally and just want to get home ASAP (we close at 10). 

So tonight I was closing like usual, and I really wanted to get home as early as I could to finish an assignment due at midnight. Of course with my luck it turns out being one of the busiest nights we've had in a while because they recently sent out coupons for BOGO Footlong after 4PM, such a fucking dumbass move, especially for alone-closers. So by the time 10 rolls around I'm fucking finishing up the dishes, cleaning the line, counting the bread, wraps, bowls, etc, and I go to lock the door at 10 and as I'm turning off the open signs a guy walks in and I tell him ""sorry, were closed"". 

He wittily responds: ""then how'd I get in here?"" 

I respond: ""I was walking to lock the door right now, you have to leave sir""

Him: ""No, I want a sandwich""

At this point I'm just thinking if this guys ballsy enough to tell a business worker to stay open after hours because HE wants service then idk what he could do. So I decide to make him his sandwich to just make him go away.

He proceeds to take a good 2-3 more mins just staring at the menu, omg I was fuming, ever dagger imaginable coming from my eyes was hitting his stare. I make his sandwich then we move to the POS/Cash register. I go to put in the sandwich, tell him his total, and he pulls out a $50 dollar bill. HOLY SHIT I get so fucking excited because we can't except bills over $20 and I pray he doesn't have any other method of pay. I tell him the bad news, he of course gets angry saying to break it anyway, well good thing I just dropped most of the money from the register into our safe before I went to lock up, so I literally couldn't give him proper change for the $50. I explain it to him as I slide his sub to the side where he can't reach it and he just leaves in a fit of rage. I proceeded to then take that sub home and eat it whilst finishing up my assignment and turning it in on time. 

Honestly if he wasn't such a commanding douche I would've just gave him the sub and tell him not to worry about it. But if you're gonna force me to do my job past our posted hours and be a dick about it, you're not getting a break. 

TL;DR: If you're gonna force a business to stay open past their posted hours JUST FOR YOU, you'd better be able to pay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/99u46e/you_think_youre_entitled_to_service_after_we/,pettyrevenge,376,1.0
2018-08-23 20:44:31+00:00,2165,Pettiness against a climate change denying senator,PoopDick_Jones,"For a bit of background, I've been working in science and space related fields for most of my career. Over the last few years I've lived in Washington DC and have slowly started to get to know some people in science and science policy around here, and of course this being DC, there's always some gala or large fancy event where big wigs like to rub elbows. This brings me to about a year or so ago, where there was one such event at the National Air and Space museum, followed by a series of talks given by a group of scientists on planetary science and the Mars rovers. Through a friend of mine, I actually volunteered to work at this event handing out name tags and setting some stuff up for these talks. 

Now this event had a few big names at it. There was an astronaut or two hanging around, but it was mainly policy folk. At one point I had to help set up in the large auditorium by putting name cards on the seats where some of the VIPs were going to sit. Here's where the revenge comes in...

I see one of the of the name cards reads **Reserved for Sen. Lamar Smith.** And if you don't know who that is, he's one of the most vocal climate change deniers in the senate, and is also the chair of the senate committee on science, space, and technology. Now I have a major problem with the person who denies the fundamental findings of multiple agencies within our nations scientific infrastructure, while also being the person at the very head of said infrastructure. So, I decide to give the senator the worst seat in the house. 

There were a few cameras that were situated throughout the auditorium to record the talks, and one of them was a rather large TV camera on a rotating platform. It had a pretty big obnoxious lens that was so long that it stuck out into the seats in front of it. I knew that anybody that would be so unlucky to get that seat would end up having that thing poke them in the back of the head for the whole presentation. So, I casually placed the senators name tag on the seat with the camera behind it, and walked away.

A few times during the presentation I noticed the camera slowly panning into the side of his head, and him turning around and getting pissed at the camera operator and the camera operator getting pissed back at him for getting in the way of his shot. Eventually he just slunk down into his seat and watched the talks almost horizontally with the camera moving around a few uncomfortable inches above his head.

2018-08-21 15:01:43+00:00,6427,"School lets valedictorian cheat on final, I get petty with a typo",AmbivalentAnonymous,"When I was in high school, I had a pretty high GPA and was in a close contest with another girl for valedictorian. This girl cheated on so many assignments/tests to get ahead and would pretend she didn't really care about her GPA. She would always act surprised when class rank was published and she was at the top (or when I was at the top for a couple of semesters, she would rant about it to her friends while publicly acting unaffected and cheat more to get ahead). 

Anyways, she got caught cheating on an AP final- not the College Board exam, just the class final. She had obtained the answers to the final in advance somehow and emailed them to her friends ON HER SCHOOL EMAIL. The principal was notified and instead of giving her some sort of fair punishment for cheating on a final, he claimed there was insufficient evidence to determine if she cheated/ which of her friends had also cheated. (side note: her parents are pretty big names in our small town, which I suspect influenced his decision) He decided to make the entire 3 sections of this class retake the final, including the girl who cheated, for an opportunity at full credit. This girl got to retake the final without grade penalty and spent 5 days in in-school suspension.

She ended up graduating as valedictorian and I as salutatorian. On graduation day, the top two are required to go up and make speeches and receive plaques from the principal. I went up, made my speech, got my plaque, and went home. Upon closer inspection at a later date, I realized the plaque had a typo: SALUTETORIAN rather than SALUTATORIAN. I laughed and showed my parents, and my dad suggested I email the school district to get a replacement one. So I emailed the main office and cc'd the principal on the email with a picture of the misspelling, with something along the lines of, ""check this out."" I got an email back with a curt apology and what was basically an order to bring it back to the school while they procured a replacement one with the correct spelling. I replied with, ""nah, I'll keep it because I feel this is pretty representative of my high school career."" I got like two or three more emails from the office and then the principal with increasingly pleading undertones to replace the plaque (because they didn't want it to reflect badly on the school and administration).

I didn't answer the emails, invited school board members and senior-status teachers to my graduation party, and displayed the plaque with the misspelling in a very prominent place at the party. You can bet I made sure the board members and teachers saw it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/993vqu/school_lets_valedictorian_cheat_on_final_i_get/,pettyrevenge,215,0.0

I’ve had investment accounts, a mortgage, credit cards, retirement, the works.  Recently I used the wrong card to pay some bills and it caused an overdraft. Yes, I recognize that was my fault, but after decades of being a customer, I think they should make an exception and refund the 105 dollars in fees.

They refused. They refused rudely, even when I mentioned the length of time I’ve done business with them, that I’d go to another bank, and the fact that I use bad customer service experiences in my training classes I hold twice a month.

I went to the branch, closed my account. The banker didn’t do it correctly, so at the end of the month there was 1¢ interest they owed me. So they mailed me a check.

Now, having worked in banking, I know it costs about $35 dollars for them to put a stop payment on a check and send a new one...

Needless to say, I have reported their check “lost” six times. So not only did they lose a 20 year customer, they’ve now paid over 200 dollars to reissue checks, and i tell over 200 people a month not to use their bank.

The ones that people always assume are rigged but in reality just really hard. At my amusement park however we have a hockey game that has 4 targets and you have to try and hit those targets in 60 seconds. You get a prize depending on how fast you can hit all four. 

Anyways, this family walks up asking to play and I agree. They paid their money and the dad plays promising his kid he’d win him a hat which can only be one in 20 seconds. The dad gets 25 seconds and I explain to him that he didn’t win a hat. The family goes ballistic even though I told them the times for each prize and the rules but they kept arguing with me for either a hat or a redo. 

So I just took a deep breath and said “Okay guys, I’ll give you a redo.” They look at me like they’ve won against me but they didn’t know what I was going to do next. I took the prize the won before and told the dad to come into the arena again. He got his stick and he started looking confident that he managed to scare the worker into getting a free game for a hat.

For the first game he played, I was pretty tired so I didn’t really talk into the mic that much but THIS TIME I decided to go all out. I was humiliating this guy. If he missed the net, I’d be like “OHHHHH HE MISSED, HES GARBAGE” or “WHAT HAPPENED BUDDY, YOU HIT THAT LAST TIME”. I did this the whole game until he finally hit them all in fucking 58 SECONDS. He won the smallest prize in the fucking game.

The family was speechless, they were trying to ask for the original stuffed animal they won and I was like “Sorry guys, I can’t. This is what you won now” Their kid started crying and their parents looked at me like “what the fuck, i have to deal with a crying kid now”

2018-08-15 12:12:20+00:00,2268,"Buy weed on debt, don't pay me back? You won't be getting any of the jackpot!",PhylaxZA,"Although it is still illegal in South-Africa to either cultivate, use or be in possession of cannabis, it is widely used for recreational purposes across the country and by all parts of the community. Here in South-Africa we call it Dagga.

It is an expensive habit if you rely on a dealer to get your weed, and then the quality is not guaranteed. We usually buy a ""banky"" of around 5 grams of weed for around R150. Converted directly to US dollars about $10 worth of weed. Depending on the quality it last for about 2-3 days.

Anyways, I realized that I won't be able to keep buying weed and that I will have to generate a different income if I still wanted to smoke the good herb. Friends also always ask me when they were out, and I then had to share my last weed, adding to my monthly dagga budget. It got too expensive to keep on buying an sharing so I decided to become a dealer!

I told me original dealer about my plan, and he gave me a considered discount as I knew loads of people who smoked that does not buy from him, so he will be getting more sales from my business.

I got my bag of weed from my dealer and started dealing to my friends. It went very well. I made enough profit to buy myself enough dagga without having to touch my normal income.

Well, one of my ""friends"" and also colleagues was a real heavy dagga smoker. I don't smoke before work and wait until I get home, get kid bathed and in bed, then sit at computer, smoking while my game loads.

This guy smoked like every few hours. Before work, during lunch and probably anytime he gets. 

He also started to buy dagga from me as my price was much lower and I was readily available and in town. If you wanted dagga from a dealer you had to go DEEP into the ghetto's(scary AF). With me working with him it was easy to get dagga.

It was around the 3rd time the week when he told me he needs a refill, but he will pay me the next week. I was like ""sure buddy, here you go!"" 

Next week comes, and he wants more but cannot pay yet, gave some excuse of his sick child or whatever. I really liked the guy and we got along well, so when he asked me the 3rd and 4th time, I gave him a banky.

Well, now my profit is screwed as I was giving out free weed to this dude, and I started to run at a lost.

I told him the next time he asked for more dagga that he needs to pay me his debt before he can get more. He got pissed off so bad! Told me how selfish I am, that I'm being a dick, and I can gf myself, he knows a dealer with better weed anyways!

I decided to be innovative and to start growing my own and that is what I did. 

I told the other guys I will be growing my own and that I will let them know as soon as it is ready, then I will be able to sell it at a much lower cost etc.

I planted the seeds but only a few plants came up.  More than half was male plants and I was left with two female plants. 

We just recovered from a long drought and while my plants was growing it really rained a whole lot. It was like heavy rain and then hot as hell, heavy rain, hot as hell etc.

One of the female plants literally became a tree because of this and it was one of the most beautiful things I ever seen in my life.  

My hand could not fit around the stem at the bottom of this magnificent plant and did she carry flowers!! 

She was this big lush bush, with branches on branches and she made the biggest flowers I have ever seen. Some of the side buds was big enough to fit in two hands. Some of the branches was hanging on the ground because of all the maturing flowers(top flowers got spoiled as it was lying in the mud /sad).

You could smell this bush meters away. I had to wash my hands with alcohol after touching the buds because of all the resin on the flowers. It was stick AF

Well, finally after mabe more than 6 months of growing and maturing I started to harvest, but man was it hard work. I had to cut of the leaves, cure the buds for 2 months and then pack and weight them. I realized that I alone won't be able to do this by myself so I invited my friends to come and cut them some fresh dagga, for free, which they can then go clean, cure and enjoy! 

""Friend"" calls me up, asking me about the offer to other friends and if he could come too. I told him to gfys, you are not welcome at my house and you will not be getting any of the loads of free weed!

Each friend left with a grocery bag or two full of weed each and there was still left over plenty for me to cure. Well it lasted me this whole winter and my new plants are a few branches high (no pun intended).

I gave up the dealing as I had enough dagga and I will be growing my own, just for me from now on!",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/97hpyq/buy_weed_on_debt_dont_pay_me_back_you_wont_be/,pettyrevenge,225,0.0

2018-08-12 01:14:26+00:00,2458,Tweedledum never shut up in class so I destroyed his sociology grade,inconspectus,"When i was in high school, there was this one group of boys that would terrorize any classroom they got in. It didn't matter if it was debate club, drama class, they would sign up for anything and talk shit all class, annoy the teachers and get away with it. 

Now, every three months, my school changed the main classes. And I was unfortunate enough to end up stuck with them every morning and half of my afternoon for three months, and worse of all: we also had fixed groups for group projects, and one of them was in mine. Being completely negligent and lowering all of our grades. 

I had studied with them for a whole year before that, i knew how awful they were. I had to endure them mocking the autistic boy. I had to listem to them talk about how rape should be legal. I had to hear them making rumors about fucking their cousins, for some reason. But what made me want to get my revenge was something much lesser than that. 

It was sociology test day, and the last one from that quarter. I watched all three of the boys decide whom to sit next to, and when one of them turned to my direction and sat on the place next to me, i knew he wanted to cheat from my test. It was obvious. I was going really well in that subject, I took extra classes with the teacher and I was overall a good student. 

Also, I knew his grades weren't great because he hadn't done the group presentation. It was an opportunity.

This teacher made a test with 5 questions, each with five options. I marked the first question on pen, and i saw tweedledum next to me mark the exact same answer, right after, and on pen. So yeah, he was obviously cheating. And not even looking to what I had just chosen. 

I proceeded answering the test, all on pencil. But instead of choosing the correct option, I marked the most absurd one, the one that was most obviously wrong. I did that to the four remaining questions, making sure he could see all of my answers. 

Once he took the test to the teacher, i marked all of the correct answers in pen, erased the pencil marks and handed the test in as well. 

Later that day, I talked to that teacher during cinema class, the extracurricular he taught. I asked him if he had noticed he was cheating from me earlier, and he told me didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but he didn't doubt it. I then told him he would have fun correcting his test.

When the time came for us to have out tests back, i was not impressed to see I had scored a perfect 10. In fact, most of the class had done pretty well on it, given it was a short test and the subject wasn't particularly hard. Even tweedledum's friends, who likely cheated from other people or their phones, had gone pretty well. 

So when he took his test and saw he scored a 2, he was very shocked. I could hear him talking to his friends, concerned about who had also taken that score so he could figure out who he'd cheated from. Honestly, it even offended me a little that he'd forgotten it was me. 

But hearing him say he was fucked, and that his grades would end up way too low? Yeah, I felt proud. I look at my teacher, and we shared a knowing smile. In the end, he kept cheating on tests, as I knew he would. I don't really care about cheating, to be honest. The problem is, I don't like people who annoy me and my friends taking the easy way out through my work. 

So yeah, I'm glad I did it. I wish I could have done the same to his other friends, but the opportunity only presented itself once, and I took it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/96ljjw/tweedledum_never_shut_up_in_class_so_i_destroyed/,pettyrevenge,93,0.0

Bitch, you did not just hang up on me! I was mad, but I took that call as a blessing in disguise and decided to forget about it. We weren’t getting paid as interns, so who cares?

They do not respect my wife, the way we raise our children or our privacy. We have tried many times over the years to talk to them about issues such as dropping in unannounced, telling people around our town (1500 people) about medical issues I am having, people hearing them talk shit about my wife to other people in town and much more. When brought up they deny they say things. In the case of dropping in, they started calling as they were driving down the street. They would show up at 6:45, in the middle of bath time (we have 4 children) before bed at 7:15. 

Much of this put a strain on our relationship and we started to distance our selves. We stopped going over to their house one a week, it turned more into once a month then once every few months. They would still see our kids at my oldests sporting events as we would provide them with the schedule. 

Last August my dad and I got into an argument where he told me I was a worthless piece of shit. We did not talk through the holidays. New Years came ( my parents anniversary) and we frankly didn’t want to see them since we just saw them at Christmas so we made other plans. My dad once again got pissed that we were not coming out to dinner and proceeded call me names, saying I have no friends, and much more. I told them they would no longer be seeing their grandkids which he proceeded to tell me their is nothing they can to to stop them.   A few sporting events passed, we didn’t stop them from saying hi to our kids. 

We had just finished a 12 year battle with my oldest daughters biological father. He finally gave up custody after being behind over $10k in medical bills and child support. That battle set us back $20k in lawyer fees. My parents knew this. 

Then one evening around 6:30 there was a knock on our door. My wife and I were being served. We were being sued by my parents for grand parent visitation.  The papers were filed they day the adoption was final. 

Over the next month we spent another $6k on a lawyer only for my parents to drop the lawsuit due to something called the safe harbor act which protects against frivolous lawsuits. 

We have received some letters, my mom tried to come up to one of may daughters at a local event. We lived about a mile away from them.  We sold our house and are moving to Texas on Friday to start a new chapter in our lives. 

This brings me to the petty revenge. Yesterday I receive 3 emails in a email I rarely look at. It was a scheduling, cancellation and rescheduling for my parents dog to be groomed. I am not sure why I am receiving the emails but I looked back and receive them in the past. 

This morning I called the groomer and cancelled the appointment. I received the notification in my email. Come Tuesday at 10:30 I will have great pleasure knowing mom mom drove about 30 minutes to get their dog groomed only to find out the appointment was cancelled. Hopefully they will not be able to fit her in. If I receive more emails in the future, I intend on cancelling those as well.

2018-08-04 05:40:25+00:00,2751,Bullies harass me because I wear hearing aids. I turn them off.,Uveampaline,"A few weeks into year eight of High School two boys started being mean to me. I can't remember what they said. But it was really mean and about me being deaf and wearing hearing aids. 

I had been bullied all through primary school, so I decided to not do anything and just turn my hearing aids off. Compared to what I got in primary school, these boys were really lame at it.

When ever I saw them approach. I'd run my fingers through my hair and gently turn off my aids in the process. It looked like I was pushing hair behind my ears. Then watch them move their mouths at me or just continue doing what I was doing. Once they had enough and walked away I'd turned them back on. They probably thought I was really dumb too now that I think of it.

I also made a new friend who was my first real friend. One day we are sitting outside during lunch talking when these two boys came up and started saying the usual stuff.

I said, without breaking eye contact with my friend, ""Yeah, just ignore them. They are really mean, normally I turn my hearing aids off, but I'm talking to you.""

My neighbors have younger kids that my child used to play with. We had a couple of run-ins with the kids with complaints of lying or playing too rough, nothing too serious, normal kid stuff. Back in May the wife called me to accuse my child of saying saying some pretty ridiculous stuff about their child (their kid has a history of lying, he's been called out by his own siblings for lying about our kid). We ended up getting together with the kids to work out it, where she proceeded to (try) to berate and attack my child about this stuff he allegedly said. I shut it down and essentially told the kids that they don't need to be playing together if they're going to lie about each other. 

Fast forward to now. Neighbors haven't spoken to us since the incident. About 2 weeks ago we noticed they parked in front of our house directly underneath our basketball hoop. I initially thought they did this out of availability because our street can get full. 4 days go by, I texted her to confirm if it was her car and to politely ask her to move it back about 10 feet. She never responded. 2 days ago I finally knocked on their door to ask her to move it back some so we're able to shoot on our hoop. She said she can't. She rambles on about how the street is full and that if she moves the car they won't be able to get the moving truck in and out of the driveway (they are moving on Friday, thank goodness). I'm standing there dumbfounded at these ridiculous reasons she's giving me (there would be plenty of space to get in and out of the driveway). I asked one last time for her to move it because there are literally no other cars parked on the street  at that time. She's says ""no, I'm taking a nap right now and I can't move it"". 

Alright bitch, I see what you're on. Two can play that game. Guess where the husband and I parked our cars for the remainder of the week? On the street directly in front of their driveway. They currently can't get their moving truck into their driveway and have to walk all their furniture and boxes up hill to the street. Sorry not sorry. 

Tl:dr Neighbors car was parked under our basketball hoop for roughly 3 weeks. Neighbor 'can't' move it because 1) they won't be able to get in and out of their driveway and 2) she is ""taking a nap right now"".  So my husband and I park our cars where they should be parking, in front of their house, inconveniencing them during their move today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/94dovm/cant_move_your_car_because_youre_sleeping/,pettyrevenge,87,0.0
2018-08-02 14:15:51+00:00,3072,Ass on a flight gets a downgrade.,ChellyTheKid,"This one is thanks to my amazing girlfriend (GF) and the ass (ASS) that sat next to me (ME) on our most recent flight. TLDR at bottom. 


We were on a long international flight, GF was going to have a window seat and myself the middle. When we got to our seats though there was ASS, sitting in the window seat. I asked if he could check his ticket and he moved to the aisle albeit begrudgingly, and a dramatic effort to move his bag from under the seat.


When the flight attendants came past she asked him to move his bag to the over head, because it didn't fit under the seat properly. I took the benefit of the doubt when his bag hit me in the head... twice. 


ASS tried to shove his bag in the space that was left in the overhead and a bunch of stuff fell out of one of the pockets. Some things landed on me and his seat, mostly paper and wrappers. As I moved them off me and added them to the pile, he snapped at me to not touch his stuff. 


So needless to say it wasn't the best start to a flight, knowing we were stuck together for the next 10 hours. Nothing to deserve pretty revenge yet, but I wanted to give you an idea of what ASS was like. 


Well were a few hours in and GF is fast asleep, I'm watching movies and the dinner service is about to start. My GF is unlucky to be lactose intolerant, not bad but she'll need the toilet a lot the few hours after eating milk products. Lucky for her on flights this means she gets her food before everybody else. 


My GF and ME have an agreement not to wake the other up for food on these flights as sleep &gt; food. The flight attendant delivers the food and I accept it for her, then ask ASS if he minds letting me out to use the toilet. He's clearly annoyed by this. I find this is perfect timing because once the full trolley service starts, getting to the toilet or back to your seat is a pain, and the line for the toilets is always short before food service. I leave GF's food on my tray so for her if she wakes up, and go to the toilet. 


I'm gone for a couple minutes and when I get back I can't believe what I see. ASS is filling his mouth with GF's food.


ME: What the hell mate, that's my girlfriends food. 


ASS: Well she wasn't eating it, besides allergies are all in the head.  


ME: You're a f***ing ass.


GF wakes up and people start looking, can't blame them it's in-flight entertainment and I'd look too.


GF: What's going on. 


ME: This d**k is eating your food. 


There was then a bunch of name calling from both sides and few people around us chime in too. A flight attendant rushed over and was able to calm everybody down. She makes ASS get up so I can sit back down. My GF with a cool head asks the attendant to check if there are any options she can have and that ""may contain or processed in a facility with milk"" is fine. 


ASS looks like he's enjoyed my GF's meal and the flight attendant offers GF the chicken which  comes with a dessert that may contain milk. 


Time for the petty revenge.


The moment my food hit my tray, GF sneakily grabbed the cheese packet and ate it with the the biggest smile on her face. 20 minutes later she was asking if ME and ASS to get up.


She comes back. 10 minutes later she asks us to get up again. 


She comes back, and the process repeats again.


ASS eventually snapped and said he wouldn't get up again. GF asks if they could swap seats. ASS seams to have forgotten our first interaction was he didn't want to give up his stolen window seat. He refuses to swap seats and tells her to ""f**k off"".


ASS is living up to his name and continues to refuse to move. People are telling him to get up and the flight attendant comes over. So happens to be the same one From earlier.  We explain the situation and GF bluffs that it must have been the dessert forgetting to mention the cheese she stole from me. 


The flight attendant offers to move ASS and he accepts with a shit eating grin on his face. GF goes to the toilet and I enjoy some extra leg room. When GF gets back she looks a bit too happy. She went on to explain that when she came out of the toilet she saw ASS again. He had an aisle seat right next to the toilet. I hope he thought eating my GF's dinner was worth the annoying toilet light, flushing, smell, and people constantly standing inline next to you.

When I was a kid, we lived on the 2nd story of a two story condominium in Wisconsin. It had a shared lawn with an apartment complex..the layout was like this l  \_ l the lines being the buildings, the center being a lawn. The far left building was an apartment complex that had it's own strip of lawn but nobody really complained when people would walk their dogs on ours. There was a woman from the apartment complex that would never take her dog out on a leash OR pick up the poop, to add to it, she would SHRIEK the dog's name to try to call him back. Apparently he wanted to be as far away from the woman as well. She would take her dog out in the middle of the night, early morning, daytime..didn't matter, and she would yell ""JAAAAAAKE!' over and over while leaving huge Labrador dumps in our yard. My step-dad tried asking her nicely several times to leash her dog, stop yelling and pick up the poos, she said okay but then ignored him (my mom worked nights as a nurse and he worked varying shifts as a maintenance mechanic so this lady disturbed my mom ALOT). He then started simply telling her to ""shut the fuck up"" out of his bedroom window...that didn't work. Finally, one morning in the winter of Wisconsin, my old man had enough. She woke him up with her screams at the dog, so he waited and watched for the dog to finish pooping and for her to go inside, he then ran outside, picked up the huge dump and took it over to her car and wiped it underneath her door handle and inside her intake vents, so that when she started up her car and kicked the heat on high she would get a fresh blast of dog poop. The best thing is, even if she turned off the heat she would 1. be cold as hell and 2. still get the scent from the vents. Unfortunately, he didn't get to witness the aftermath BUT she stopped taking her dog into our yard and we never heard her shrieks again. We did get to watch her come home drunk with some dude one night, throw up all over the place and then proceed to make out with the guy.

2018-08-01 09:50:24+00:00,7362,"""im sorry but you dont cut my paycheck""",Amnial556,"So to set the scene I work in a failing restaurant. People are jumping ship left and right and I'm one of them. Or trying to be. I'm a cook and the last ""good"" one left.  In total there are 4 cooks left. 

So before so many jumped ship I was working a morning shift with a cook who I will call R for this instance. 

Well R , to give some idea of the type of person she is, she's a very short, angry , person that can't do her job but and apparently shits nice smelling flowers. 

She likes to cook on the egg station but can't due to needing someone to hold her hand. Call every order of eggs. I refuse to do so since she refused to do anything else. I'm running around the kitchen cooking everything from pancakes to steaks while she sits on eggs and misses every other order. I simply don't have time to call them to her and run the rest of the kitchen. To top it off, when a customer complains about said eggs she yells at the server who asked for a remake. Overall she is a bitch to everyone and refuses to do anything beisdes eggs. She does so and leaves. 

Well finally that shift ended for her and she was on her way out. She hasnt done any cleaning, any stocking, absolutely nothing. So I politely ask 

""Hey R can you please change the trash out before you leave?"" 

And she replies yelling ,

""You see this is why we don't work well together. You don't cut my paycheck and I don't need no KID to tell me how to do my job!"" 

She yelled other stuff but it's not important and mostly random babbling. 

Well to start. I am young. I'm younger than the majority of cooks in a restaurant and definitely younger than most for a cook lead position. But I do not take kindly to people pulling an age card especially when I have more experience, in a leadership position and definitely not from someone who can't do a simple task. Give respect get respect. 

So fast forward to the present. I'm moved to night shift due to a cook unable to so so anymore and others leaving. And I happen to see on the schedule that R is the morning cook. 

Thus begins my revenge. I clean the required places. But oops. I forgot to change the trash, stock the line or brick the grill. So she walks in with nothing on the line, trash overflowing and the icing on the cake, a party of 24 walked in as I walked out. 

She seen this and before I left yelled again saying x and x Is supposed to be done. And that I need to stay and help with the party. 


My reply 

""I'm sorry you don't cut my check. And I dont need some little bitch telling me how to do my job.""  And I walked out and went home.

I’ll give you a nice scare and then ban you for life.,madelynrose27,"Little backstory: I’m a pizza delivery driver and most of our business comes from a large college campus nearby, meaning lots of drunk/stoned/annoying/stupid college kids ordering. We deal with a lot of bullshit from them and we rarely get tipped there.  

 

So this is what happened: I’m doing my normal deliveries to campus, which involve calling each customer to come outside the dorm to meet me (the doors are locked and only students have access). The next day, I get a text from my boss asking if I remember delivering to a particular college student, and she gave me his name and a phone number to look up in my call log to see if I delivered to them. Sure enough, I had called that number the previous night and I actually remember that specific customer because his name was on the delivery. Let’s call him Chad. My boss told me that Chad called the shop and complained that he never received his order the previous night, so she looked up the order details and saw that I had taken it (there’s a record of every order showing which driver took the order, customer information etc). This infuriated me because I know for a fact I had delivered to Chad. I even remember what he looked like and what he was wearing. He filed a corporate complaint saying that he never received his order and he wanted a refund. His argument was that I gave his food to a random person and they signed his credit card receipt, stealing his food. This doesn’t add up because if I had given it to the wrong person, wouldn’t he have called me back asking where I was? If I had food delivered and the driver said they were outside and weren’t there, I would’ve called back immediately wondering where my food was. Chad waited until the NEXT day to call and complain. Oh hell no, there was no way this idiot was getting his money back for food HE ALREADY ATE! I called his phone number and said “hi this is your dominos driver, the one who delivered to you last night! Im not sure why you’re trying to say you never got your food when I clearly remember handing it to you, therefore you won’t be getting a refund” He hung up. A couple weeks go by and I guess Chad got over it because a college campus order came through with his name on it. This was my chance to confront him face to face. I got to campus and tried calling him, but it wouldn’t go though. He BLOCKED my number! I asked someone if I could borrow their phone. When he answers I say  “hi this is your dominos driver, remember me? I’m gonna need you to come down with your credit card and ID so I can make sure I’m giving this order to the right person!” He hangs up without saying anything. A minute goes by and a girl comes down saying she’s picking up the order for him. I say, “sorry but I’m gonna need him to come down since last time he tried to say I gave his food to the wrong person!” He comes out and it’s clearly the same dude from before and he obviously recognizes me. He snatches the food out of my hands and runs away, without signing the credit card receipt. Now technically, if you don’t sign the receipt, we can’t process the payment so you’re stealing the food (confirmed by my manager). So I call up campus police and they said if he doesn’t sign the receipt he’ll get arrested for larceny. The cops show up, go up to his dorm and bring him downstairs. The look on his face was priceless! He signed the receipt ( no tip of course).  After all this you’d think he wouldn’t order pizza from us ever again, but nope! He kept trying to order from us and we would have to cancel them immediately. So now, he’s blacklisted from our shop.

My friend and his classmates came to Germany for some training in Munich, so they arrived a week earlier for a short trip around the area. 

This happened on the last day of the trip. We took a train from Innsbruck heading to Munich. As a very careful traveller, the whole group bought the tickets with reservation (I wanna use my discount, so I bought the ticket seperately without reservation). Well, it's not unusual that when you get on the train with a reservation, there might be someone sitting on your seat. So, one of us asked them nicely in English to give us our seats, because we paid for them. Everyone were happily complying and changed the seats, well, except for this couple. In front of us, they were nice and everything, but when they seated on their new seats, they started talking. Well, I wouldn't know this if I didn't sit next to them (because I didn't have any reservation, I needed to sit seperately from my friends and I ended up next to them). 

I am a Thai student and have been studying in Germany for 4 years, so I understand German pretty well. I wouldn't pay any attention until I notice that the man was talking trash about us in German, something like ""Look at those luggages, the Chinese are going home."" or ""It's true that they all look the same"", and some other racist things. I kept my eyes on my Kindle and try not to cause anything. 

A while after that (they still talking trash about us non-stop), a conductor came to check the ticket. I made a small talk with him in German, and I made sure that they would hear me too. The looks on their faces were priceless. After the conductor left for other passengers, they had stoped talking and stayed silence for the rest of the ride. They would hide immediately after I looked up at them from my Kindle.

But bullies can still push my buttons in a wrong way. Before starting, I may be in the wrong for doing this, but it is what it is. 

A week ago, a bunch of guys came for a few. They seemed like OK dudes, early 20-is, but the group dinamic was kinda off. Introducing the main antagonist. Obnoxious guy, too loud, snapping his fingers at me when ordering (don't snap fingers at bartenders kids, we're not dogs), punching his friends in the shoulders all the time,... A sportier, really aggressive version of a David Spade character he was. 

Next to David Spade, sat the victim of most of his ""playful"" teasings. Silently enduring his shit, I really felt sorry for this fellow. He wasn't a drinker, but he looked like he would rather be drinking distilled devils piss than continue sitting next to this macho maniac. He was really uncomfortable. David continued to bugg him to take a shot at least, ""come on, one with me, don't be a pussy, a bitch,..."" until, after whole night of persuasion, finally my dude waved the white flag. Ok, lets do one shot together, then leave me be. 

""Two of your most fucked up shots,"" Spade shouted snapping his fucking fingers, while I imagined snapping his fucking neck. Oh, you'll get a fucked up shot, buddy. I made this two layered shots,  but while looking almost the same, they were different. David got stuff like Red Jacques Senaux Absinthe (75% alcohol), Stroh (80% alcohol), tabasco (110% flaming diarrhea), really nasty bussiness all together, and other guy got mostly syrups, juices, harmless stuff. They looked almost identical, Red Absinth can pass visually as a cranberry juice, Stroh as a syrup from brown sugar, Sambuca as anything colorless, etc...

They took their shots and all hell broke loose. Other guy chugged his shot like a champion, not even flinching (why would he, he drank juice). But David Spade... Boy, oh boy. He looked like he'd have a brain aneurism. Tears pouring from eyes, coughing like his lungs want to come out, he had a face and a posture of a man who just got waterboarded with some sort of chilly sauce. Other guy looked surprised until he caught a wink from me, but David Spade and the rest of the crew, now roaring with laughter about his misery, suspected nothing.

They got their shots on the house, poor dude was left alone, and David was a good boy for the rest of the night, deflatedly enduring small mockings from his fellows. Now, I may have used my powers in a wrong way, but this is the first and only time I messed with customers drinks. And I regret nothing. He was rude, aggressive even, to everyone around him.

So a couple of years ago when my wife and I first started dating, I was working as security at a local bar. For the most part I enjoyed my job. I made between 90 to 120 a night for only a few hours work and I got to be front row for any concerts we held there. The only problem I really had was with this one bartender that worked there, who we will call BT for Blonde Twat.

BT made it an almost nightly effort to either to try to get me into trouble or overall just be an unpleasant person. All of us on the security team knew she was screwing the owner, so she got away with murder pretty consistently. In the end she got her way and successfully got me fired over some total bs. So I left and moved on with my life.

Now, my wife and I work overnights at different hotels and earlier this morning she calls me. Apparently, BT tried to get a room at the hotel my wife works at with some random dude she was trying to screw and didn't recognize my wife from when I worked at the bar. 

Using this to her advantage, the wife decided to get a little petty revenge on my behalf by telling BT she couldn't rent her a room because she was on the Do Not Rent list. BT was furious and demanded to know why she was on the list. Straight faced, my wife tells her it says in the computer that she was banned for urinating on the mattresses and that emails had been sent to all the hotels in town to warn them about her. 

Dead silence followed for a moment as BT processed this and the man she was with stood behind her, disgusted. She stormed off and the guy just stood there for a moment and asked if that really happened. She told him yes and he left. They stood in the parking lot for a whole moment having a passionate conversation and then left, presumably to drop off BT and never see her again.

Goes to show that if you spend your life being a bitch to the world, the world will be one right back.

Background: I am 19 years old and attending college, and I currently work at an amusement park during my summer break. 

This happened last night while I was at work. I work at a couple of he rides at the park, and at the time I was working on on of the big rollercoasters as someone who checks the seatbelts before the ride starts. It was about 9:50 pm, and the park closes at 10. In between cycles, I was standing talking to 2 of my supervisors and a co-worker. As we allow the next group of riders brought the gates to get on the ride, I noticed a middle aged women headed our way. 

“Hi ma’am, can I help you?” I asked. She went on a complete rant about how she “waited forever in line” and that we are all “incompetent for not being able to run the ride faster” and she ended her pleasant remarks with “How old are you all? Like 20? Why aren’t you in school? You should get a real
job!”. I was annoyed, but responded in the most obnoxiously upbeat way “actually, ma’am, Most of us are in college, and are working here over the summer to help pay for it. Thank you for your concern though!”. She made some noise and then turned to head into her seat. 

I felt really good after that response, but then I saw that she had no shoes on. Technically, to ride the rollercoaster, you had to have shoes on. We make people put them back on if we see them take them off, but if they don’t have them with them at the time we usually let them ride anyway and tell them to remember to bring them next time. I decided that I wasn’t going to give her that luxury. “Oh ma’am, do you happen to have shoes with you? you can’t ride this ride without shoes on.” She immediately got very angry. “My shoes are all the way at the entrance of the ride. Besides, I’ve ridden this ride before without shoes, it’s fine.” I smiled bigger than I probably ever had before. I unlocked her seat and said “Sorry ma’am I cannot let you ride without shoes, there’s a sign at the entrance that states this as well. You have to go get your shoes and wait in line again.” She looked absolutely pissed, and my supervisors backed me up when she tried to argue. 

Now, this ride is big, so it’s honestly a decent walk to go out the exit and back around to the entrance. By the time she stormed out it was like 9:57 pm. My supervisor went down to the chain to not let anyone else in since it was about closing time, which meant that women couldn’t ride the ride at all!

While he's inside and I'm seething, I can see that we can all get by if he had just closed his door.  Inconvenient, but not the end of the world.  So, I walk over to his car, expecting to discreetly close the door.  Oh, hey, his windows are up.  Oh, hey, the keys are in the ignition.

Oh, hey.

The doors are all locked.

With a big smile, I closed his door firmly, finished pumping my gas, and watched with glee as he tried to open his now locked-and-running car while I pulled away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/90l3v2/newsflash_other_people_exist/,pettyrevenge,235,0.0
2018-07-19 19:46:11+00:00,10671,Don't insult my engagement ring! 💍,a_j_summers,"My fiancé and I had been dating for four and a half years. In that time, we have bought a house together, adopted doggies together, I put him through pharmacy school (med school really, and lots of people don't realize that pharmacists are doctors as well or how competitive it can be), and we fell even more in love. He's an amazing man and I'm crazy about him.

Imagine my excitement that after braving all of the ups and downs and watching life unfold as a team, that he proposed. I was overjoyed and through tears of happiness I said yes! (And of course our doggies were involved.) It's a larger, slightly blush pink, amethyst stone with a halo of topaz around it set in rose gold. I loved it. It was perfect.

The next day, I was attending a baby shower for my best friend in my home town. I trekked my way there, and even though I tried to downplay the engagement because I wanted it to be about her, she made a mini announcement because I knew people who were there.

Most people did a little congrats type thing, which was nice, except for her cousin. This girl, let's call her Amy, is super religious. Actually, everyone from my home town is super religious. And I appreciate their faith, but I didnt like her judgment. She has voiced her opinions before about how people shouldn't live together unless they're married and all that jazz. 

So when she sauntered over, she took my hand in hers and scrutinized the ring. She more or less said that at least he was making an honest woman out of me and that he had taken too long to propose. Then she kind of scrunched her nose at my ring and asked what kind of stone it was, with a little, snobby, half-smile on her face. She also said that it was generic that he would ask me now that he's graduating because that's what ""everyone does"".

I don't know what came over me. I love my ring and I've never been this mean girl, but I've known Amy for a while and shes always been like this. She likes to say what terrible decisions other people have made and how she always puts Jesus first, so that's why her life has turned out so well. She says it's because she has followed ""His plan"". Which ultimately led to her getting married ridiculously young to a guy who really isn't good for her at all and just leaches off of her. She had to put herself through school and work while he would go on long stints out of the country to ""find himself and follow God's path"", which I really think meant bang other women. She married him in the middle of a college year before one of the times he left, I suspect to entice him to come back and have commitments here.

Well, I went for it. I said ""Oh, he waited until he knew he could provide for me. It's a pink diamond.""

Her whole face changed from smug to envious. She practically threw my hand down and mumbled how happy she was for me.

I looked up how big my petty lie had been later, only to find out that yes, pink diamonds are actually a thing, and the teeny ones are like, $10,000.00!?! But hey, she doesn't have to know how poor we are! =D we are rich with unconditional love and loyalty, and that's why I'm happy to call him my future husband. &lt;3",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/9093pv/dont_insult_my_engagement_ring/,pettyrevenge,1022,0.0
2018-07-18 23:36:27+00:00,7159,Try to run me over? I'm sure that parking spot will be available any second now.,thatguyinconverse,"*Background*: I'm in an indoor parking garage of a mall. The place is packed - took me 15 minutes of driving up and down the building to get lucky and find a spot. I parked the car, almost walked out of the building but suddenly remembered I left my wallet back in the car.

*The Offence*: As I walk back along a clearly marked pedestrian crossing, a guy in a 30 year old BMW almost drives me over, stops and gives me the most annoyed look humanly possible, no trace of remorse or anything, barely lets me take a step back and drives off in the same direction I was walking in.

*The Revenge*: I unlock my car from the distance, making sure he sees the tail lights light up. As expected, he stops, happy to wait for a parking space to free up. I get into the car, and instead of taking my wallet and leaving, I start the engine, and then pretend to fumbe a bit inside, looking at the guy through the rear view mirror.

As soon as I noticed his patience running thin and him starting to drive off, I reserve back a bit, making him stop and wait more.

After several minutes (which, undoubtedly, seemed longer for my new friend), I stop the engine, take my wallet, get out of the car, and, while maintaining eye contact with the other driver, give him the biggest shit eating grin I could muster, and walk off towards the mall entrance.

The dude was fuming, hit the gas, and drove off. I could head his tyres a screaching in the distance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/900m6j/try_to_run_me_over_im_sure_that_parking_spot_will/,pettyrevenge,86,0.0
2018-07-18 11:16:07+00:00,4339,Steal my seat? Guess I will do nothing...,gmkh99,"So first, you need a bit of context. I am a writer and a games developer. I was 19 years old but I do have a baby face. I had coursework due the next day and I was getting a train down to London. It is a long trip and I specifically reserved a seat with a table. 

So I had my laptop and my notebook, as well as a small travel bag. Nothing much. I managed to get on the train about 5 minutes early and began searching for my seat. When I got there, my seat was taken by a business man. I quickly said that it was my seat, but he insisted that he only had one stop and had very important business that he needed to do. I could already smell the BS, but I agreed, taking the seat behind him that had no access to a table. 

We are about 30 minutes into the trip when I am getting annoyed. He has sat there reading a news paper and sipping a coffee at the table that I needed. I got up, put my notebook and laptop on the table, and asked him to move. He rolled his eyes and loudly announced that I was an annoying little brat that didn't understand true work ethic. During his little rant, his hand 'accidentally' bumped against his coffee, sending it over my notebook, laptop and my white shirt. I was furious. 9 chapters of a book was in my notebook, as well as indepth character analysis. My laptop was a gift for getting into university. He took one look at me, up and down, and just laughed. He said it was my fault for being a brat. 

By this point, the entire train car was listening to our little tat. I was near tears. A woman was kind enough to get up and berate him, giving me her jacket and offering me food. She was lovely. She helped me salvage what I could of my notebook. Luckily, my laptop didn't get any coffee in. The man that was opposite to my devil lent down, spreading his legs far so the man was trapped in his seat. Someone moved behind him and pressed his legs against the back of the guys chair so he could feel it. My personal petty revenge on his man didn't come for another year. 

I was once again heading down to London to see my sister. I didn't need a seat with a table as I was already on summer break. But then I saw him at the end of the platform. Now, I am not proud of what I did. But it felt so good at the time. His train ticket fell out of his pocket and fluttered to the floor. And I. Did. Nothing. I smirked as I walked past him, heading to the train door. I don't think he recongised me, but gods it felt good. The conductor came through and checked our tickets around 20 minutes in. I had positioned myself so I could watch the entire thing go down. The man got in a shouting match with the conductor, yelling about how important he was and that he shouldn't even have to pay for a ticket. It was so fun to watch and just get this small bit of petty revenge on a man. He got kicked off at the next stop and the police were called due to the man assaulting the conductor. 

Tldr: man refused to move from my seat, gets kicked off a train and gained a police record a year later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8zul0q/steal_my_seat_guess_i_will_do_nothing/,pettyrevenge,188,0.0

He went and told his sons to turn off the tv while I worked on the power.

Not 30 seconds later this little 12 year old brat came marching up to me and demanded I restore the power as he was in the middle of a very important fortnite game. His dad didn’t even flinch at this like it was a normal thing for a kid to say. So I told the kid very politely that if he gave me 5 or so minutes I’d have it back on for him.

Not 2 minutes later he again marched up to me and demanded an update and asked what was taking so long, again I was polite and told him that I wouldn’t be long.

At this point I was pretty annoyed at both the kid and dad so when I had finished working on the power instead of turning back on straight away I left it off for another 10-15 minutes while I cleaned up just to spite the kid.

My roommate, on the other hand, works evenings as a waiter and it's not unusual for him to come home past midnight, especially on service industry nights when him and coworkers all hit the bars. Then he gets to sleep in till noon while I'm heading out to work. Normally he's pretty good about staying quiet but on this night I got woken up at 4am (on a Monday morning) to the loud boom of an ""artillery shell"" firework, and then another. And then one more for good measure. Since I couldn't get back to sleep before I normally wake up, I spent time thinking about petty revenge. Right before I left for work I put a wet towel into the (very) squeaky dryer near his room and then asked Alexa to start playing fireworks sounds at full volume 2 hours later (yes there is a fireworks ""skill"" that Alexa can learn).  


So he'll probably have to stop the dryer or listen to it squeak for an hour. And then about the time he's back asleep, Alexa starts playing firework sounds at full volume and directed at his room, for 20 minutes straight.

Right away I’m face to face with this old man as he is berating me about how we stole it and it must have been one of my busters.

After looking in the seats and under the table (mind you we are crazy at this point and this is just killing my to do list in my head) I told him we don’t have it and I’d trust my bussers with my life’s savings so I know they don’t take it. We have cameras so I told him to leave his name and a number we can reach him and after the rush I’d check them to see who took it.

Just this evening I was taking my dog on a walk. She’s a good old girl but was getting antsy after being stuck inside from the heat. She knows to take every opportunity to poop because we don’t have a backyard so she plops a massive turd on the grass and being a responsible pet owner, I bag the big mushy turd to throw away when I pass a dumpster.

We got to a semi busy four lane road, there’s enough cars and they are going fast enough that I wait at the crosswalk before going across. One car stops, nice, we start to cross. 

Next lane in, I can tell the driver isn’t slowing down. If I keep walking in the crosswalk he will hit me and my dog. Don’t put my dog in danger, it made me pretty mad.

I stop, because I’m not stupid, and toss up the big ripe bag of dog poopy. The car comes within two feet of me (and my dog stuck close to my hip) still going 35 mph (speed limit on that road) and the bag explodes over the windshield.  

Background on me. I’m a 330 lb 6ft bearded man. A lot of that weight is in my tummy, but I wear a size 58 jacket in the shoulders so I’m thick as a grand piano and can square up when I want to (I’m actually pretty nice, I work with disabled kids professionally and dealing with people bullying my clients is the only other time I get scary)

Driver slams on their brakes with a big brown puddle over their windshield, I flip double birds and look pissed, driver pulls out again and drives on. We walk home and I give good doggie a treat because it seriously scared me that some idiot could have killed her because they weren’t careful.

2018-07-13 09:35:56+00:00,2418,"You all are going to be asses? Well let me learn you the hard way, then.",psychololly,"So this happened about three years ago, I was 19 and in 'university' (that's how I'll call it because I live in Europe things work a little different around here).

I am female and I was assigned a group project for science class with 3 other guys who were all a few years younger than me (think 16/17) and extremely immature. I'd be the ONLY one to bring up the project an *try* to get us all together and share tasks. They'd laugh at my face, be annoying, make misogynistic comments about me being dumb because I'm a girl and and just being typical douchey teenage boys in a herd, I suppose? Because *fuck me* for trying to actually pass school. 

I was getting kind of nervous not so much because the due date was getting close, but because the due date was getting close for *this particular class, with this particular teacher.* To give you an idea, this teacher was pretty tall, around the age of 60, had a glass eye and - I kid you not - a mustache that looked a little bit *too* much in the style of Adolf Hitler. He was also extremely conservative in his way of doing/ thinking. I promise you, you did not want to get this guy pissed because it was hell. I was legitimately scared of him, and so where most of the other classmates. Most of the time he'd be 'nice', but in a way that had 'make one wrong move or noise and I'll go nuclear' all over it and he was just very condescending in general. (BUT he was one of the only teachers in our university that knew what he was talking about, so I'll give him *that*.)

So anyway, due's getting close, I was getting scared and I started to realise I wasn't going to be able to talk to these guys by myself. Also I simply refused doing all the work for them because fuck them. I knew that if we didn't finish this project on the day we had to though, we'd probably remember it for the rest of our lives lol. So I send fuhrer teacher an e-mail, explained things weren't really going anywhere because my teammates simply refused to work with me. He answered something along the lines of getting together with the group and him to have a talk with him.

For the last time, I went up to my worthless project-group to inform them I e-mailed the teacher and we had to be at the classroom at x time to sort things out with the teacher and try to bring this whole thing to a decent end. Of course, once again I didn't get a normal answer. This time one of them dudes (lets call him Peter) says 'Did you send him nudes of yourself or something? Because he doesn't reply to my e-mails.' All of them laughing again. I just smiled and left, because this was the last fucking straw for me but I wasn't going to give them the pleasure of snapping. 

We finally sit down with the teacher, us in a row across of him. He's being his serious and scary self, making some patronising comments about how we are basically retarded for not being able to figure this out ourselves, and asks us what the problem is. I look him dead in the eyes and tell him 'Well, one of the problems is that *this guy* assumes I'm sending you nudes to get in touch with you through e-mail? Maybe we can start there.' 

I looked at Peter and his face went completely blank. I have never seen a teenage boy shit his fucking pants the way this guy did. I was smiling internally but not externally because honestly I was too afraid to do that. I was almost too afraid to look at the teacher too, but I did and he was literally turning red. I've seen him mad, but never *this* mad, raging about how he had the guts to say something like that, what Peter think would happen if kids in school picked up on a 'rumor' like that and just completely ranting on and destroying him. God, it felt so good. My other group members did not dare to speak a word, of course. They all looked scared as hell.

The kid tried to apologise along the lines of 'I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to, I actually really like \*my name\* and females are not dumb' it was a pathetic shit show but it felt *so fucking good* and I promise you we finished the project perfectly in the end and I barely had to lift a finger anymore.

I had to go to the ER a few years ago because I got something stuck in my eye. The pain was excruciating, and it was bad enough that the urgent care clinic said I really needed to go to the ER. 

I go to the ER, get through triage and immediately see a doc who flushed, dyes, scopes, and eventually is able to get the burr out of my eye without blinding me. All good, I think, because the hospital is in network. Well, fine readers, it turns out that while a hospital may be in-network, you can be treated by a doctor, IN AN EMERGENCY, and get a bill for thousands of dollars because the doctor you saw, FOR AN EMERGENCY, was an independent contractor and therefore out of network.

I was FLOORED to get a $3100 bill for the care I received. Sure, I was happy that I wasn’t blind, but $3100 seemed steep. I called, and sure enough, the facility fees were almost nothing thanks to the insurance discount, but no discount at all on the Doctor. I was very angry, because I really had no choice in who saw me. And if there had been no in-network doctor on duty, would I have had to wait?

So, I hatched a plan. They would not negotiate on price AT ALL. I thought this was ridiculous. I could have paid the bill, but I have principles, damnit! I told the billing folks that I couldn’t afford the bill, and wanted a payment plan. I’m not sure if there is a law requiring them to accept a payment plan, but they agreed and asked what I could afford. I told them $10/mo. 

Here is the thing about medical bills. They can’t charge you interest on them. They also cannot report you to collections if you are paying. Finally, it has zero impact on your credit score if you take a payment plan (unless it goes to collections). 

So now, for a procedure I was billed $3100 for a little more than 2 years ago, I’ve paid $260 on. I have the $10/mo on auto-pay and I’ve basically forgotten about it. 

They’ll get their $3100.... but it’ll be over almost 24 more years. And they will spend almost $150 in postage, mailing me a bill every month that immediately goes into the shredder to be recycled.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8y5h3f/tell_me_the_doctor_who_saw_me_for_an_emergency/,pettyrevenge,708,0.0

We were on a plane trip to Toronto and as annoying little sisters always do, they begged and screamed for the window seat. I was in the window seat, and my parents had no other choice than to switch me around so I got the aisle seat. Normally this wouldn’t annoy me, but all throughout the flight she was making comments like “haha sucker”, and “you don’t get to see out of the window haha!” Meanwhile I knew exactly what I was going to do.

Near our return date, I checked in online since my parents aren’t very tech savvy; I then noticed the option to change our seats. I placed all her friends in another row (some family friends were travelling with us) and I placed her in an aisle seat; you might say, “well why can’t she switch with another family member?” I was feeling particularly evil so I put her in a row where there was only the aisle seat left; this meant that 2 other strangers would take up the middle and window seats, if I was lucky.

We got on the plane and I blamed her separation from the rest of the family on luck. Nobody wanted to move from their seats, and as an added bonus, when she tried to start a ruckus again, the people next to her (rightfully) told her to quiet down.

I did not want to start a confrontation, as I was very sleepy. 

Then, an idea formed in my mind. I grabbed my little jar of petroleum jelly and slathered a lump of it on my neck. I usually carry petroleum jelly so my skin doesn't get dry (My skin is chronically dry and cracking). Anyway, there's this glob of petroleum jelly on my neck, and I hear the kid jostling against his seatbelt to slap my neck again. I secretly smile as his hand recoils and he utters an ""EWWW!""

2018-07-08 20:07:28+00:00,4403,Impatient road raging sports car guy gets to wait... and wait.,SomeWhoIsNotMe,"Short preface:  My entire adult life people have thought I was a cop or looked like a cop etc.  I have a shaved head because I'm balding, I'm tall and kind of imposing I guess. I'm not a cop flunky, not a gun owner, or anything like that so so there's no ""cop wannabe"" slant going on here. I simply get mistaken for a cop a lot. I've never pretended to be a cop or act on this in any real way either. I'm quiet and mild-mannered typically.

So I'm driving along on a split, four way road in our town and I'm approaching a stoplight where I see a minivan stopped at the light in the left (inner) lane. The right (outer) lane is also occupied.  A small sports car is rolling up behind the mini van. I watch the light change to green as I'm slowing down and in an instant, convertible sports car guy is honking, just laying on the horn.  I can see the mini van has a mom in it and she's dealing with some kids but she didn't do any gross delay in moving the van forward for the green light before this guy is laying on the horn. ""What an a-hole "" I'm thinking. 

He then whips his car around her to the left (into oncoming traffic) and nearly causes an accident, passes her,  and THEN as the traffic has picked up speed, he is in front the van and abruptly stops for no reason forcing her to slam on the brakes.  I just so happen to be in the right lane and get a perfect view of all of this douchebaggery.  

Just as he is looking into his rear view mirror and smiling (stopped in the middle of the road) I pull up right beside him with my window down and while pointing at him  and in my most booming voice say "" You!""  he turns and looks at me and his smile evaporates and eyes get big.  ""Pullover onto the next street, park your car and wait for a uniformed officer! DO NOT leave the scene!""  He nods, takes a left and pulls over and I slowly cruise past and I laugh to myself how quickly this guy's little road rage move went from smile to ""oh shit!"".  I then go on my way to go get groceries.  

Here's the best part, I have to drive by the same spot coming back 45 minutes later and he's still there, out of the car now leaning on it looking frustrated at the no-show cop. Teehee.

TLDR: D-Bag driver drives recklessly and then is told to wait for a cop that isn't showing up.

(I realize that impersonating an officer is a thing but I can't help if others make assumptions. Shrug.)

She lives almost an hour away and it's past 10pm, so I politely decline and let her know I might be able to make it out this weekend. (Tuesday night of the call). She's very unhappy and tells me she needs a computer to run her business, so I have to come fix it for her. I say, no, I have to work early tomorrow so I have to sleep, but I'll put together a system for her and she can come pick it up this week.

So, next day, I get a laptop together. Nothing great, something like 4gb ram, a Pentium dual core, and windows 10, but it has a DVD drive, wifi, etc, a perfectly fine laptop for most tasks, only a few years old. The next day, she comes by and picks it up. She doesn't even say thank you (I am not charging her, just letting her use it until I can fix her main computer) and complains about the drive over. I shrug it off and tell her I'll be by Saturday to fix her desktop and collect the laptop.

However, I get a call the next day and she's screaming at me. The laptop is too slow, it doesn't have her files, and that I gave her a piece of junk. I try and explain that it's the best I had free (literally, as she's not paying for it) and that her files won't magically transfer. She then states that her kids are driving her crazy because it won't run Fortnite, of all things. She then told me she wants me to drive over and get her a new laptop that fits, and even said she wants one similiar to mine (I have a gaming  laptop I spent a significant amount of money on).

So here's where the petty revenge starts. I drive over after work, walk up, and collect the laptop at the door. I tell her that I left the other computer in my car so I walk back and put my laptop in my car. Seeing as this was a free laptop I was letting her use, I didn't really get why she was so mad, and I really didn't want to deal with her, so I simply drove back home with my laptop and didn't come back. She of course calls me multiple times and I don't pick up. On Saturday, I drive out again and fix her desktop while she verbally berates me for this, then I charge her repair cost + the gas for me driving out twice. She since then has realized that pissing off the guy that can fix her computer isn't the best and has been more polite to me since.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8wle0v/reject_my_free_laptop_enjoy_having_your_kids/,pettyrevenge,435,0.0

I didn't know this when we first got together but 6months into the relationship I figured it out pretty damn quick. I was pregnant (he broke the condoms. I didn't know.) And he had made me quit my jobs (yes plural. He didn't work until later on in the relationship.) So I was dependent on him. ANYWAY. fast forward to the end of the relationship and he beats the shit out of me, I call the cops, pack my shit, go to the hospital and then the police station. My mom picked me up the same night and took me back to her house. Skip ahead 2 months and my ex is behind bars awaiting his hearing. I go to his sentencing hearing and not only did they let me speak, they let both my parents speak. ( He couldn't speak to any of us and had to sit there and listen to whatever we said) 

My mom called him a ""shitty sperm donor"" and a ""no good methed out bum"" 

My dad went off and I seriously thought he was going to try to kill him.  

15 minutes later and it's my turn, I go off and tell him he's an asshole and i hate him. At the end, just before I end my speech, I look him dead in the eyes and say ""btw, you have a tiny penis and its shaped funny"" and I swear to God the judge had to turn around because she was trying not to laugh.

We’ve always had the problem of people just leaving them all over the place after they are done so we put a very obvious and hard to miss sign stating “PLEASE RETURN CARTS OUT BACK” with a little arrow showing you exactly where to go. The other I’m super busy with a lot of carts to clean when I happen to see someone drop their cart off RIGHT NEXT THE SIGN...so I give a little wave and say “back over here sir if you don’t mind!” In th friendliest voice I can muster.

So I go grab his cart before others decide to leave theirs with his cart and I see a pair of Sunglasses and an expensive looking box of cigars. 

Sure enough about 10 minutes later he comes back to where I’m cleaning and asks if I’ve seen them saying he lives about 45 minutes away so can’t make the drive that often. Instead of telling him I found his stuff I say “I haven’t seen it sir but the Shop has your number and when I have time to find it they can call.”

I don't remember what this one was advertising but there was no number to call to try and 'unsubscribe' from them.

I decided that calling back at 1am was the appropriate response.

2018-06-30 17:29:54+00:00,2679,Try and steal my boyfriend back? Fuck you and your spelling mistakes!,Ahoy_Koi,"Let's just jump into it, a few days ago when my boyfriend and I were cleaning up our old rental and moving in to our new place, I found a 4 page letter addressed to my boyfriend from his Ex of 10 years (We'll call her Tammy.)

Let me give you a quick summary about Tammy:

-She's a pathological liar. (Confirmed by everyone he knows.)

-She's a physical abuser. (Confirmed by the pictures of the many scars she gave him with her nails.)

-She's crazy af. (Confirmed by everyone and me because she has the balls to text me that they're married and I'm taking her ""husband"" away (AKA her bank account).

So, Tammy was writing to him about ditching me and to remember all the good times they had and how many times he said he loved her. Of course I was *pissed.* My mind was doing mental gymnastics because my boyfriend told me that nothing was going on between them for years and here she was talking about smacking lips days before we got together. I showed my boyfriend right away and he scoffed and said he got that 2 years ago but didn't even bother to read the whole thing because he was told it was going to be a list of the stuff she was sending back to him, not a fucking plea for him to come back. I belive him because she has a track record of trying to break us up in crazy ways. Like that one time she straight up told him to denounce me and marry her so they can start a clean slate, or the time she told everyone he's a pedophile so he'd stop dating someone younger than him and go back to her.

My boyfriend reassured me that none of it was true and I just felt this rage. This friggen liar has pushed all my boyfriend's friends away and even tried to get his own family to turn against him (She started telling her lies with his dying grandma ffs). She's been harrassing us for two years and I've always wanted to get some kind of revenge for my sweet love.

Now, I'm not very good at writing or wordz but Tammy is probably one of the worst spellers I've ever met. One tiny example is she sent back a box that had Telus stuff in it and in the front of the box she wrote, Tellus with two L's despite the fact that everything in the box had Telus written all over the product. So I grabbed my handy-dandy red pen and started to spell check all 4 pages and signed our names on the bottom with a little heart beside my name to let her know nice try, but she ain't ever getting back with him no matter how many lies she spews.

I also gave her a D- cause she aint getting no D any time soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8v3ejs/try_and_steal_my_boyfriend_back_fuck_you_and_your/,pettyrevenge,210,1.0
2018-06-29 19:35:54+00:00,4573,"Oh, of course I'll switch shifts with you!",comfycheesecake,"I've posted one of my stories about the small movie theater I used to work at before. I've since moved on from that place in favor of working fulltime at my less stressful and better paying summer job, but I left with a treasure trove of stories that I think this sub will enjoy. 

Now, for the most part, I loved my coworkers at Local Movie Theater. They're the reason I stayed there as long as I did, and I am still best friends with some of them to this day. Some of my coworkers, however, were less than stellar. I'm sure we've all come across that one coworker who always tries to get people to take their shifts. Why they bother having a job if they're never going to work is beyond any sane human's understanding, but whatever! As long as it doesn't affect me they can make as little money as they want. 

Penny was one of these coworkers. In the 6 months I worked at Local Movie theater I could probably count the number of shifts we worked together on one hand. And this is with a staff of only about 15 people, mind you. As I'm sure you've guessed by this point, Penny wanted me to switch shifts with her. Now this is an oddity in and of itself. Penny never offers to *switch* shifts, she expects people to take them without any favor in return. The reason for this rare occurrence is because by now she had learned that I don't enjoy this little game of hers, and the only way to get me to cover one of her shifts is if she does one of mine. It would have worked, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids! 

My shift was a Thursday, 3 to not listed. A weird shift, but whatever. I wasn't going to complain about it. Weekdays in general are dead at Local Movie Theater, so it was bound to be another lowkey shift of watching vines with my GM in his office, and in all likelihood they would let me leave after two hours. Penny's was a Saturday 5 to 10. Our busiest day during our busiest times. So, for understandable reasons, I did not want to switch with her. Penny hadn't worked a Saturday in months, and I hadn't had a Saturday *off* in months. I told her no and assumed that was that. 

**SHE CHANGED THE SCHEDULE ANYWAY.** 

If we want our shifts changed the managers let us sort it out ourselves and change the schedule that's publicly posted outside their office. I went in for my Tuesday shift and checked the schedule before I left, having a funny feeling that she might've done something, and sure enough she switched to have my Thursday. The fury of a thousand dying stars burned within me. I was seeing red. This was treason or the highest order, but I didn't tell management because I did not want my revenge tinted with bureaucracy. 

I did some digging on why such a weird shift was scheduled in the first place. You see, that weekend was opening weekend for Avengers Infinity War. It's another reason I didn't want to take her shift. The whole weekend was going to be hell. I was even angrier than before. But Thursday, as I found out, was going to be much worse. 

Thursday is a popping day. Normally the morning shift pops because it's literally a graveyard shift, but a quick glance at the schedule told me that Penny was the earliest scheduled crewmember that day (a manager was covering the whole morning by herself). Popping popcorn is *the worst*. Even just a couple of bags could take an hour to do if you factor in the cleaning. Our managers were very picky on the cleanliness of the machine, and because the process took so long we usually popped around 25-30ish bags at a time. Somebody who knew what they were doing could get that done in 3 hours. Penny, due to never actually working, only knew the bare basics about popping popcorn and didn't know any of the tricks to make it go faster. So the night before I text her. 

""Hey, I saw that you switched out shifts anyway without telling me. That's really not cool, but I'm fine with keeping it like that because I had plans for Thursday anyway.""

I of course conveniently left out the fact that Thursday was a popping day and that there was no way in hell one of the managers were popping that morning. 

She texted back about an hour later at 2 am. ""Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you! I never got your text about saying no and assumed you'd be okay with switching. Thanks for giving the okay!"" 

Penny went in on Thursday. She didn't know that it was a popping day, so there was no way she could've known she was going to be popping in preparation for the biggest movie of the year. Penny had to pop *60 fucking bags of popcorn*. She was there until 1 IN THE MORNING because she is awful at popping and takes forever to clean. That alone would've been enough to make it worth it.

But the best part? The diabolical cherry on top of my malicious sundae? 

My manager called me on Friday and said he accidentally overbooked the Saturday evening shift and that his higher ups were making him cut somebody out. He figured I would appreciate the gesture, having been working so many weekends shifts and all. Penny got to spend her switched shift popping popcorn for 10 hours, and I got to spend mine going mini golfing and getting sushi with my friends. 

She never asked me to switch or take her shift ever again. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8uvzb3/oh_of_course_ill_switch_shifts_with_you/,pettyrevenge,112,0.0

2018-06-28 20:24:24+00:00,2481,Abuse my generosity? Enjoy having your account terminated.,pumaFGT,"I work on a popular freelance site doing voice over work. I charge for voice overs by the word, and at the time was charging a fee per 150 words. In addition, a client can purchase commercial rights, allowing them to use my work for their own commercial gain.

One day, I received a message from an animator who created whiteboard animations for clients. He wished to hire me to create the voice overs for his animations, but didn't want to pay what I charged. He wanted 300 words for the same price as I would normally charge for 150 words. Because of the promise of consistent work, I agreed. I made sure that he did or didn't need commercial rights (some animations are made for private presentations for companies, where commercial rights would not be needed, while others were made as advertisements, where commercial rights WOULD be needed). He was very snippy with me about his low budget and refused to purchase commercial rights.

The client was very particular about a very cheap order he was getting a deal on, but was ultimately satisfied with the quality. The next day, he sent me a message asking for 400 words for the same price. I had nothing better to do, so I accepted. He then proceeded to send me a script with more than 600 words, more than twice our original agreement. When I told him this was larger than the amount we had agreed upon, he threatened to cancel the order (bad for me) or leave a negative review (worse for me), so I begrudgingly did the job passably and got a good review. I blocked the client soon after.

I was going to be done with him and let it roll off of me, until out of morbid curiosity I checked the page for his animations. The voice overs I had performed were being used in advertisements for companies without the commercial rights being purchased. To be honest, I wouldn't have cared that much were he not so snotty to me and had he not threatened me when giving me more work than we agreed upon. I contacted support of the site with a full copyright infringement claim, with screenshots of our conversation, the order number where he refused rights and tricked me into doing more work and threatened negative reviews, and the raw audio files from my computer to prove that they were mine.

If he wouldn't have had a bad attitude and tried to threaten me, I wouldn't have cared.

So in my city there is a pub that's attached to a doughnut shop that serves the best doughnuts in the city (which always causes a long line). Because its attached to a pub, it doesn't close shop until 9PM as there is a solid flow of business rolling in. 

Anyway, my girlfriend and I get a serious hankering for some snacks so we decide to head to the doughnut shop and arrive out around 8:30 P:M by car. Now, there are only three parallel parking spots a little up the street from the place, and they are all 15-minute spots which are usually full.  We see up the street that, count our lucky stars, a spot is free! My girlfriend pulls a little ahead of the car in front of the spot, turns on her indicator, and begins backing into parking spot when this little white vespa driving behind us whips into the spot. I roll down our window and call out to the driver ""Scuse me, we were just backing in"". The driver seems to be a pretty univ student who shrugs her shoulders and calls out to me ""sorry, first come first serve!"" while her and her friend share a good laugh. 

My girlfriend suggests we just get doughnuts another time, and I tell her she can drop me off here, Ill buy the doughnuts since I know what she likes, and she can loop around. She agrees, and I pop out of the car, pass the little white vespa where the girls are still inside gathering their things, and head to the shop. As always, the line is super long for doughnuts and since this is the last batch, the doughnuts are slim pickins. The girls are behind me looking at the 5 or so different flavors that are left, talking about which ones are best and which they havent had yet. I one of them jokingly mention ""thank god we got a parking spot"" and they burst out laughing. I get to the front of the line, and when asked for my order, request two dozen doughnuts, which is every last one remaining. The girls behind me didnt listen to what I ordered, but eyebrows of confusion started to form on their faces and they slowly saw each doughnut loaded into the boxes and their options dwindle. 

One of them (the driver) in desperation asked the baker who was loading them in ""what, youre not even gonna save a few for us though?"" to which I turned around and said ""sorry, first come first serve"".  She honestly looked like she just simultaneously solved a movie mystery and shit her pants, its difficult to put into words but truly an expression I can never forget.

I'm super petty over really minor things so I've been trying to think of stories to share. So assuming this is well received I have about 100 other stories to tell. 

TL;dr: Group left me to write a paper by myself so I threw them under the bus. 

So this was back in my 4th year of university. I was taking an elective which was a 1st year course so most of my classmates were freshmen. 

Cue the group work. First assignment and group is fine we hand in our work and everything is peachy. 

Second group I get is a nightmare group. All 3 of them refuse to do any work toward our shared grade. So I'm doing all the work for this project and the teacher decides she wants a progress report memo. 

The rest of my group decides right away that I should write the whole memo by myself. I'm a fourth year so I can write a progress report memo in like 20 minutes but it's the principle of the thing so I'm irritated at this point. 

At this point it's worth noting that I had a hunch that the teacher liked me. It was hard to tell just because she didn't intonate while speaking but i had a feeling. 

So anyways I wrote the entire paper, referred to our group exclusively as Nuckchooking and Team #yoloswag(this was the newest thing at the time). 

I also wrote about how the group had made no progress because team #yoloswag refused to do any work and how they weren't capable of university level courses. All in all a 3 page rant on how irritated I was. 

 The teacher received our memos and the next class she announced that she was splitting the grades into individual instead of grouped and was giving everyone feedback forms for their group members. 

In the end I got an A and the rest of my group failed. I think they tried to appeal the grade but I had submitted documentation showing that I was the only one doing work.

""Look at this butthole, such a face full of shit. You can tell that he is an American swine"" and then they proceed to discuss me. For an hour.

The very next night, he did it again and I brought it up to him again.....cuz no one wants to be a snitch to the boss, right? Wrong.

The very next day, I failed to charge my phone and woke up to realize that my phone was dead and I was late for work so I got dressed and boogied my sorry ass to work, which was only a 5 minute walk for me. I apologized for being 50 minutes late and he seemed cool about it....until I found out that he called the boss after only 25 minutes, something no one on our team had ever done in my years of working here, claiming he was just concerned for my ""well being"". Even my boss told him to just wait it out and that he was sure that it was just an accident and that it happens sometimes, cuz he's fucking cool like that. 

My boss even told me afterwards that it was no big deal and couldn't imagine why CW would call him, at 7:10 in the morining, on a Saturday, when there was literally nothing he could do about it. Then he asked me about a piece of equipment that got left down for 6 +hours so I had to come clean. I told him that I sent coworker an email about it and then it happened again the next day. He asked me to forward the emails to him so he could address them with CW. He also asked me not to ""shield"" CW from incidents like this because it made the whole team look bad and he needed to address it with CW personally.

So now, everytime I catch a mistake CW makes, which is far more often than I thought, I forward the information directly to the boss so he can see first hand all the mistakes CW makes.

I haven't talked to CW much since the incident. I am curious about his well being though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8sr3o8/you_say_you_only_called_the_boss_out_of_concern/,pettyrevenge,253,0.0
2018-06-20 14:26:02+00:00,3324,Cut in the three hour line for the ferry? I’m filling your car with seagulls.,drforrester-tvsfrank,"If anyone here has travelled from Galveston, Tx to Crystal Beach, Tx, you know it’s a nightmare. You have to take a ferry where you wait in line for 2-4 hours depending on how much traffic there is, drive onto the ferry, sail across the bay, and drive off the ferry onto the Bolivar Peninsula. The line for the ferry forms on a two lane road, the idea being one line is for the ferry and the other is for locals to get around, however it’s all too common for people to skip 100% of the line and cut in at the last second, despite there being a ton of signs that say no line cutting and Galveston PD driving around ticketing people who line cut. 

So there I am, being a dutiful citizen and waiting in line for the ferry, way far into hour 3 of the wait, and I’m almost to the gate when this douchebag cholo comes flying in and cuts me off. I start flashing my lights and honking, trying to alert the police around, but get nothing and the guy has the audacity to flip me off and settles into the line. Ten minutes later we’re on the boat, and the last two cars in line, side by side on the back of the boat. The ride across the bay takes about twenty minutes, so it’s common for people to mill around the boat, there are restrooms and sitting areas. Douchebag cholo gets out and gives me a shit eating grin and gestures like ‘fuck you, I made it!’ To me. He then goes inside the boats superstructure towards the bathroom. 

I can’t help but notice Mr. Turd has been gone for a while, and I have a bag of pretzels in the front seat. So, I grab the bag of pretzels and walk to the back of the boat, where they allow you to feed the seagulls. I make it rain with pretzels until there is probably a good 40-50 seagulls captivated by the bag of pretzels. Mind you, we’re both parked right by the back of the boat, so I make sure that I conduct my feeding activities squarely behind his car, and away from mine, and in short order my flock of seagull parishioners do what they do best: cover his douchemobile in gigantic seagull shits. You know, the nice big, impossibly white and runny ones. I even stealthily threw a bunch of pretzels on top of his SUV to make sure they spent a lot of time crawling all over the vehicle. 


Presently, I see the Peninsula coming up fast, we’ll be there in maybe 5 minutes. I start walking back with about a quarter of a bag of pretzels left and I realize that Mr. Douche has left his front windows open. The opportunity is way to good, so I pitch the bag of pretzels into the second row of his seats and climb back in my car. Sure enough, as soon as I’m in the car, the seagulls bombard the Douchebag’s SUV. By the time he came waddling out when they sounded the arrival horn, there were probably 15 seagulls thrashing around the inside of his car fighting over the bag of pretzels and the outside of his car was COVERED in seagull shit. He started freaking out, yelling at the birds and engaged a losing battle to get them out of the car. Never even looked back at me and I dunno if he ever put two and two together but holy shit did he get heated. He was screaming and swearing and carrying on at the birds and by the time we docked and I drove off, he had just finished getting the birds out of the car and was scrubbing seagull shit off his dash and drivers seat with his t-shirt.

2018-06-17 14:57:16+00:00,4165,How I beat a a cheat without being a snitch,Mr-Hatchet,"This happened in the 3rd grade and I want to add this did not happen in 'murica.

In the 3rd grade we started to learn multiplication tables. So our math textbook had tables from 1 all the way through 10. It is standard that we memorise them. Our math teacher used to have daily quizzes at the end of the class. There would be 3 sets and in each would be 3 problems. The one who finishes the set the fastest would get a star. The problems were basic multiplication of big numbers like 123 * 98.

So you get a set, solve, if first  and all correct then get a star. Then you get the next set. The stars didn't matter in terms of your final grade, but for a 3rd grader it was respect and bragging rights lol.

Our desks were placed very close to one another and next to me was this girl who was new. She would always be 1st to solve and get a star. And she would do them ridiculously fast. One day I noticed that she had her textbook open with the list of tables at her disposal. She did this EVERYTIME. 

I was freaking livid EVERYTIME she did this. I'm no snitch but this cheat must go down. So one day after she solved the first set and went to verify her answers and receive her star I quickly stole her textbook and put it in my bag. 

From the corner of my eye I saw her look everywhere for that book. I tried so hard not to laugh and couldn't solve anything that day.

This must be the most petty thing here lol.

2018-06-16 15:40:12+00:00,5076,Park like a dick? Enjoy climbing over everything to your seat.,Ginko_Bilobasaur,"LTL, FTP. On mobile so please excuse any formatting errors, yada yada yada. We good? Awesome.

So I live in an apartment complex and the parking in front of my unit is first come-first serve. We do have designated parking, but I'm the complex's infinite wisdom, our spot is about halfway across the complex. All of the residents have kind off made it an unwritten rule that those free spots are for the tenants that live in front of them and that the last person home uses the designated spot.

Then there's Van Guy.

He drives a white van (yes, the surveillance van type) with a bunch of tools in the back. Like, this thing is jam packed and I have no idea how he's able to get anything out of there. Now, I have no problem with someone having a bigger vehicle, especially if it's for work, provided that they know how to park it. Spoiler alert: he doesn't.

He backs into a spot every time he parks and I don't know if he's being a dick or just thick but will always be over either one or both lines because of how crooked he parks. I've come outside many times to see him inches away from my car despite having parked first. He's blocked me in before and I've had to wait to leave or take my SO's car. Luckily, he's never blocked me in when I had work or somewhere important to be, but still a dick move.

So last weekend, he parked WAY over the line for the parking space next to the spot where I usually park (once again, not designated, but my car is usually there. If it wasn't open, I would've found a different spot) and I grew tired of his bullshit. I knew that I was going to be doing absolutely nothing all weekend, so I parked close to his van, yet far enough away that he could still squeeze into his door. That is, until I backed up further and had my non-folding side view mirror placed ever so perfectly alongside his driver door to where he wouldn't be able to open that door more than maybe 3-5 inches. Then I waited.

Friday comes and goes, he's still parked the same way. Saturday, same thing. It wasn't until Sunday around 10 am that I hear a loud ""Oh, what the FUCK?!"" through my open window. I take a peek and, sure enough, there's Van Guy standing in front of his van. However, there's a new development to the story. A Ford Heavy Duty truck (I want to say an F250, but I have no idea. I'm not a truck guy. It was one of those big ass ones that take up damn near an entire parking spot) had pulled into the spot on the other side of him and was on the line. So, not only was his driver door not able to open, but he couldn't open the passenger side either.

You have no idea how satisfied I was sipping my coffee and watching this guy create a path from the back doors to the front only to pull forward enough to get out and load everything he just unloaded back into his van.

On the bright side, he's been parking a lot better since then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8rk4zp/park_like_a_dick_enjoy_climbing_over_everything/,pettyrevenge,122,0.0
2018-06-14 16:13:10+00:00,3831,Accidentally got revenge on food thief!,JigglyPumpkin,"I had this really great office job that I totally loved. Minimal effort, sweet paycheck, tons of paid downtime, cool boss. The only downside was the boss’s wife, who I definitely did NOT work for, who showed up sporadically to boss me around.

During Girl Scout season I had brought in a box of Samoas and had shared them with my boss. I left the box there after work, with like three cookies in it, to eat another day. My boss had a habit of working extremely late after I left. So the next morning I come in and find the now empty box with a (hilarious and completely joking) nasty note attached, going on about how horrible it is to leave someone a box with only a couple cookies in it for them to steal. We have a chuckle about it. 

So I decide to get him back for the nasty note. Also, in a completely joking manner. I brought in a partially eaten roll of Thin Mints. We had a bunch of cardboard laying around, so I traced a cookie and spend about an hour cutting out cardboard cookies. I put them in the package and put three real Thin Mints on top. So when you took the roll out of the box it looked like someone had opened it and only eaten two or three cookies. I put the box in my desk, in a drawer I kept snacks in, and waited. And waited, and waited, and waited. Nothing. The cookies remained undisturbed. I kinda forgot about them.

Then I get a call late at night from my boss’s irate wife. She’d been in the office by herself (just messing about, she doesn’t do any form of work for the company) and got hungry and started rummaging through my things. Which she had no business doing. She and I are NOT pals. She found the box of Thin Mints and ate the three real cookies and three or four of the fake ones before realizing they were actually cardboard. When she called ranting at me, she was pissed that I’d faked her out with cardboard cookies, but had thought that they must be some kind of diet cookies which was why she’d eaten so many before examining them to find they were cardboard.

The next day I showed up and ‘apologized’ to my boss for the prank (that was clearly meant for him, and he totally knew it.) That’s when he told me that he’d seen the Thin Mints and passed because he can’t stand them. So overall, prank not wasted!!! Every time that woman did something to piss me off, I’d just picture her angrily eating stolen cardboard cookies!! 

Aside: I even tried to chew a small bit of cardboard myself, because I couldn’t imagine a normal human thinking that could possibly be a diet cookie. After that experience, I honestly don’t know how she swallowed one down, let alone several!!!

2018-06-13 22:34:17+00:00,6349,Keep bumping into me and standing too close because I refuse to crowd the person ordering at Starbucks? Enjoy my farts.,BonesMello,"So, the title really says it all. Here I am trying to be polite to the person ahead of me who is ordering at Starbucks when I feel that ominous “someone is way to close” twinge. I look over my shoulder and this woman is almost literally pelvis to butt cheeks and glaring at me like I’m personally preventing the life-saving coffee from being express-injected into her otherwise mind-numbing existence.

When I look away, I feel it. You know what I’m about to say... you know she “accidentally” bumped into me just enough to get me to step forward, and then the twinge comes back. This woman, after her little victory, is smugly trying to use personal space to get that microsecond of saved time so she can have her coffee.

I stand firm. I Ignore the inevitable second bump.

Now you may be asking, how far was he from the register? Ten feet? Twenty? No, my lurking friends, I was probably two standard average human paces from the guy ordering at the register. I always do this. If I get peeved at some jackass standing over my shoulder as I try to order, I’m certainly not doing it to someone else. Even if he is ordering every conceivable add-on to a Frappuccino his adolescent girlfriend sent him to get.

But not Miss Needs-a-Fix... oh no! She must be CLOSER! When her second bump failed to get results she tries huffing repeatedly. When her obvious frustration at my inability to acquiesce doesn’t work she begins to pretend to search the cold case hoping that’ll get me to move. Look lady, we ain’t stupid... you’re not interested in some cold chicken wrap, and I’m not moving.

Then the third bump hits, but I saw it coming. I am not ashamed of my genetic disposition to being a gassier human then your normal butt-trumpeter, but I try to not let fly in public queues. I made an exception and released my tenuous grip on a gut-gurgler I felt coming on at the start of this line-jockeying ordeal.

She bumps and I farts. I even let out a decidedly dramatic “Oh! Excuse me!” with as much feigned sincerity as possible...

You better believe my personal space was no longer invaded.

Relish that one, lady. I brewed it just for you.

Picture it: Chino, CA. 1998.

My husband was the first of his friends to own a home.  He had a pool table in the garage and his buddies would come over and drink beer and shoot pool into all hours of the night.  There was one guy that my husband didn’t really care for, I’ll call him Billy.

Billy drove up in his motorbike and parked it next to the driveway in the grass.  It was fairly new sod so husband asked him to move it.  Billy totally laughed it off, and wouldn’t move it.  

My husband was pissed.  Seething.

He kept asking him to move it and Billy kept refusing and telling him to chill out. 

My husband then extracted the greatest revenge I’ve ever heard of in real life.

There was a home under renovation a couple of doors down, but no work going on because it was the weekend.  There was a dumpster in the driveway.

Husband got three of his friends who also thought Billy was being a dick and they picked up the motorbike and put it IN THE DUMPSTER.

Then they refused to help the guy get it out of the dumpster, so Billy had to call more people to come to the house.  Several had to get into the dumpster to hoist it up and others had to retrieve it from the outside.

2018-06-12 15:37:57+00:00,2321,Don't share your food and expect me to do your dishes? Have a post holiday break treat!,_unregistered,"Obligatory this happened a while back, in college.

In college for my second year, I was living in a large house with some friends. You know how they say that living with your friends is a good way to make them no longer friends? Well in this case this would be true. It was just before winter break and we were all recovering from the party the night before and getting ready to head to our families for the break. I needed to take a shower and run some errands and someone was still passed out in the shared bathroom so I asked my roommate who had the master bedroom if I could use his. He said no, really for no reason but to be an asshole. Finally after a long debate he let me use it on the premise that I cleaned the shower after. Sure, whatever.

After I get out of the shower I come downstairs and he's cooking enough breakfast food for all four of us that lived in the house. I ask him what's the occasion and he said that he's just cooking up all of his food so it doesn't go bad. Rad! I grabbed a plate and he asked what the hell I was doing. Sure, kind of rude of me to assume that it was just for everyone, but I mean it's enough food for 4 grown men and then some.  Then he tells me that if I want some of the food he'll let me have a plate as long as I do the dishes and replace all of his food when we return. Um? No, you've got to be kidding. He's not. I tell him ""Whatever dude, it's all yours"" and leave to run a couple of errands before I make my trip back to my parent's place for the break. 

I get home and all of my roommates are gone. There is also a pile of all of the cookware in the sink with all of the food still in the pans. I call up the roommate who cooked it all and asked if he was coming back to clean it. Nope, he isn't. He said while laughing, go ahead and have some. Mind you, if it was still on the stove or not stacked with pans touching the food below it, or water in some of the pans soaking the hash browns with dish water that'd be kind of polite. But no. The only thing I can think of as an appropriate response is to take the dishes and put them into a safe place so he can lovingly wash them when he returns about 3 weeks later. I stack the dishes onto his computer desk in his room, grab his towel and use it to give his bedroom door a good seal to keep in the freshness and then leave for the break. 

Few weeks later I return before any of my other roommates. No real smell coming out but there's no way I'm going to give into my curiosity and open that door. That's for my kind roommate. He gets home and stands at his door confused for a minute. Why is the door closed? Why is there a towel sealing the bottom? Good questions. He opens the door and all sorts of colorful language comes out of his mouth. I think he may have invented a couple of new words even. He storms over to me with one of the nastiest pans I've ever seen in my life threatening to beat the shit out of me with it and that he was going to smear all of it in my bed. I calmly remind him he forgot to do his dishes so I set them aside so he could when he got home. 

Thankfully he did not beat the shit out of me or rub the food into my bed. He did however realize he was a bit of a dick and then went and cleaned the dishes. The house was really cold for the next few days as all the windows were open airing out the stench. It was really bad. As soon as our lease was up he moved out and the rest of us moved into a different house that was smaller.

2018-06-11 19:52:17+00:00,3604,"Threaten my dog? Curse at my wife? OK, best of luck with that car.",random_drooler,"This is petty revenge from a year and a half ago or so, but I never used reddit much so I'll post it now.  My wife and I had some neighbors who decided to take it upon themselves to be proper jerks.  Their list of grievances include:

1.  Parking directly in front of our town home.  For non-US people a town home is essentially a house that's in an apartment complex.  So houses right next to one another.  Each home has a parking spot directly in front of its door, and then an extra space in between.  Jerk faced neighbor has three cars, only two of which work, and keeps the broken one in front of his house at all times.  He needs somewhere to park his other car, so instead of doing it 10 or so feet away he chooses to do so directly in front of our apartment.  Not super bad except for the fact that it's a giant truck with confederate flat bumper stickers and a 'lift'.  It was miserably awkward and usually parked on the curb so as to make it inconvenient to even walk off our porch.

2.  He and his wife (more on her in a second) were leaving their house when my dog ran over to them.  He had just darted out the front door and ran in their general direction.  They saw him, hopped in the car and backed out quickly, knowing he was near their wheels.  When I grabbed him I got the middle finger.  Classy as hell.

3.  One day while backing his ratchet pickup truck into the spot in front of our house my wife comes home.  She watches him back up and pull forward 2-3 times trying to park his house on wheels.  Of note, he blocks the path so she really has no choice but to wait and then she can pass him.  After he finally parks she drives by him and he takes the opportunity to ask 'Do we have a fucking problem?  You're staring me down like we have a problem.'  She just ignores him and walks into the house.  Also of note, he's a scraggly redneck.  I'm not big and tough.  This isn't an r/iambadass or anything, I don't make any absurd threats and the lawn claps or things like that.  We just shut the door and laugh, but it's a bit much.

So, those are obnoxious, but largely things we can ignore.  The deal breaker for us was when I receive some mail.  I open it because we have been expecting updated licenses (as having just moved).  It's not for us, it's his wife's nursing license.  That could cause all sorts of problems for them.  Instead I have our daughter take it over and explain that we opened it thinking it was our license.  Cue trashy husband asking a 10 year old if she stole their mail and telling her he would call the cops.  That'll do.

For the petty revenge.  They have 3 cars.  The busted one that doesn't run, the giant redneck one, and his 'work car' which has no back door handle on the driver's side.  The hole doesn't go all the way through.  It just reaches into the door itself.  That became my new repository for really anything I felt would amuse me.  Dog shit?  Sure, I'll pick it up and bag it.  Cleaning out the fridge?  Those plums can go there.  Cleaning out the freezer?  Bagged, frozen tilapia also goes there just fine.  Frozen shrimp?  Sure!  Old potato soup is a good fit.  Hell, let's add a whole bag of old lentils that we don't want.

The aftermath:  Nothing for quite a while.  Easily 5 weeks or so.  Then one night I get home and walk by and happen to notice the windows are down in the car.  That strikes me as a little odd at the time.  We live in Florida and everyone probably wants to use AC.  Next night same deal.  Again it never really dawns on me.  Then a day or so later a knock on the door.  It's the cops.  Next door neighbor called them and accused us of 'fucking with him'.  I look out behind the cop and see redneck guy, having taken the inside of the door off with an absolute stew of stuff around his feet.  The smell then hit me.  Well worth it.  ""Sorry officer, but I don't have time for pranks with redneck idiot.""  ""No sir, I'm a professor, I'm not really about prank wars.""  A quick ""Well, if you see anyone around his car please let him know so we don't have a repeat of this."" and the cop was on his way.  Revenge never smelled so sweet.

I got to the station pretty early so i was hanging out waiting for the doors to open and for them to check my tickets.  I could tell that it was time to board soon since more people started showing up. I took that as a sign to get up and stand in line. Since i was there early, i was basically the first in line. All good.

Then, This crotchety old cunt rolled up and deliberately cut in front  of me in line some while later. I politely told her that the line started back a ways, but she showed me away.

Fine, whatever. Clearly she was in a rush.

So a minute or two later we board the bus and i see she took one of the window seats close to the front.  I tend to go for the front row too to avoid having to wait for everyone else in front if me to get off the bus, so i can see why that would be appealing. It’s also nice when you have a row to yourself, as people are less inclined to sit next to y’a if there are other empty rows available. Her sitting there would deter most people from sitting next to her. 

Then, i had an idea. I took the aisle seat right next to her just to spite her. No row to yourself now :D Not for the next 2 1/2 hours anyway. 

And since I had nothing better to do (not like she gave a shit about my time anyway), you bet your sweet asses that once this bus stopped its journey, that i didn’t leave my seat or move over until the rest of the bus cleared. She asked me to move but i showed her away.  She can be last for this time.

2018-06-09 20:27:12+00:00,21206,I just bombed our previous dog walkers on every review site I can find their name on,Captainpanda55,"Our neighbour came to us and said she had something she needed to tell us. She looked really nervous and was apologising for 'getting involved' and 'sticking her nose in'. We calmed her down and got her to explain that our dog walker was only letting our dog out into our front garden for about 10 minutes and then taking off without a care in the world.

Obviously I didn't want to trust this on face value so we got one of those smart cameras that alerts when someone comes into the house. Day 1: Rupert's let out for 10 minutes, exactly as our neighbour said. I asked the dogwalker's wife (they operated as a couple) how long he'd been out.

'About an hour?'

Hmm. Later that week, he was out for 20 minutes. In comes the message later: 'Rupert's been out for a walk and then came back to ours for a play in the garden'.

What, the house of yours that's a 15+ minute drive away? So he went for a walk, was driven about 15 minutes to your house, played in the garden, was then driven back ALL in 20 minutes? Impressive.

I'd seen enough so I asked them to clarify this, I was up front about the camera and explained our neighbour's concerns. I didn't get aggressive and was honestly hoping I was mistaken somehow. Instead I got a defensive rant that accused me and my neighbour of spying on them (by having a camera in MY own home? Yeah alright) and dared to insinuate that I misunderstood our original agreement. They then cancelled on the spot and returned the keys the next day.

2018-06-05 10:41:28+00:00,2542,"That's what you get for calling customer service ""retards""",isurviveonmemes,"So, three years ago, I worked as an agent in my hometown station. My job consisted in walking up and down the platforms, help customers with infos, directions, and also supervise trains departure. 

As every service worker, I had a ton of rude and agressive people. My boss told me that it was part of my job, and as sad as it was, I should always stay polite and never answer back. We could bitch all we wanted in the break room with out coworkers, but never in front of the clients of course. I had people call me a ""slut"" because their train was late. I never got back at them, mostly because I did not care.

BUT that day, my coworker and I were on the platform, preparing the departure of a train. Now, let me break it down to you. Five minutes prior to the door's train closing, we whistle a first time. That whistle is done so travelers can hop on the train. We have to check that the platform is empty before whistling a second time so the train can depart. We check, it's empty, we whistle, and the staff on board proceed to close the doors. The train departs.  


At that exact moment, out of nowhere, a guy starts running behind the train with his luggage, trying to open a door while the train is departing. Super dangerous behaviour. It's not allowed to run on a platform, even more if there's a train on the tracks. My coworker whistles and shout at the guy. At first, he didn't listen and still try to get to a coach. But the train didn't stop \(obviously\). He got super frustrated.

He turned and rushed towards us, and started shouting at us. Calling us ""bitches"" for not whistling \(which we did\) and also ""a bunch of fucking retards"". Then he angrily walked off, while insulting us. This is where I noticed that he had earphones in his hands. That dumbass was just blasting his music so loud that he didn't hear the whistling. 

We didn't say anything. But as soon as we walked back into the breakroom, we told the story to all of our coworkers. Fifteen minutes later, I'm at the front desk, and that exact same guy is waiting in the line to get a refund on his train ticket. As soon as I noticed him, I loudly said "" Oh, that's the guy I told you about ! The one who think that we're a bunch of retards"". He heard me. That glorious look of embarassment on his face when he walked up to get his info, in front of  8 employees staring at him with big smiles on their faces. 

When my coworker and he were done, I said ""Have a very good day sir."" He didn't answer and just had proceeded to his walk of shame towards the exit. Don't know if he had a good day, and don't care, but he did made mine a bit better. I love customer service.

We usually get the assortment of people from kids, dope fiends, tweakers, nice old ladies. You know the usual. One day I was cashiering, and in walks let's call him devaun to buy cigerrettes. He buys his pack of Marlboro red, I ring it up think nothing of it. Later on he walks in with two friends that will be called asshole 1 and asshole 2 or A1 an A2 for short. They do their munchies shopping and lop it all on the counter not separating it. So I go to ring it up.

A2:""hey man this is seperate""
Me:""alright man let me get the manager to void this"" 
Go back to scan some stuff. 
A:""didn't you fucking hear this shits separate""
Me:""I'm sorry, can you separate all the stuff you would like me to ring up for you?""
A:""really gonna make me do your job for you""

I didn't respond to this comment and started ringing up stuff. I finish with him and move on to A1's stuff. All the while A2 and A1 are shit talking me. Well during this shit talking fest I hear remarks to devaun saying thanks for paying for my cigarettes. That is when my cashier revenge boner poked up. These kids couldnt be more then sophmore or juniors in highschool. I finished with A1 and devaun is back asking for a pack of orange eagle 20's and a pack of Winstons. 

Me:"" sorry man can't sell you cigarettes. I have reason to believe your buying these for a minor."" As I motion toward the other two.
A2: ""the fuck you mean you can't sell us cigerrettes! You guys do it all the time.""
Me:""I will gladly sell him the cigerrettes if you can show me ID stating your 18 years old."" 
They looked at eachother for a minute
A1:""I would like to speak to your manager"" 
Ahh music to my ears 
Me:""gladly hold on a minute please."" 

This was the gotcha bitch moment. I retrieved the manager and I was told to cash out the rest of the line while they talked and this is what I heard. 

A1:""you worker over there won't let our buddy buy cigerrettes""
A2:""yeah this is some bullshit discrimination"" 
Manager:""did he tell you why he couldn't sell you cigerrettes?""
A2:""yeah it was some bullshit about him thinking that devaun is buying us cigerrettes.""
Manager:""Well let's find out why he thinks that""

Basically the manager asked me all the reasons why I thought he was buying for someone else and he basically agreed we shouldn't sell them cigerrettes. He gave them a warning and told them that if they try to do it again the police will be called.

My dad, being the cheapskate he was, bought him and mom decent seats on a flight, and the very back seats for my brother and me. This is a dick move, as my brother is 6'5 and weighs like 240 at this time. The poor thing couldn't even sit up straight and had to tuck his legs in. It was to be a five hour flight.

A very nice flight attendant kept checking up on us. Asked us if we were okay, did we need anything. My brother was very polite and said no, he would manage.

The flight attendant kept looking back at us, all worried. She disappears for about five minutes, and comes back with a big smile. She says she can't stand to see my brother so clearly in pain, and they has a lot of space in first class. She tells us the seats are ours, and to follow her to our free upgrade. 

We pass our parents on the way to the front, and my dad asks the flight attendant where we're going. She explains the situation. He asks if he and my mom could sit with us. In a brief moment of genius, I look at the flight attendant, tell her I don't know these people. My brother agrees, and they're left in their inferior seats next to a mom with a crying infant.

I was only 20, but had just bought my first house and needed furniture, for the entire house. I went to buy a shit ton of furniture for the mostly empty house.  I’m not big on shopping so I choose a place close by and was going to buy everything possible from one place.

The first store had two employees and they ignored me, one being the manager.  Honestly I would rather browse in peace and while I couldn’t hear what they were saying, I got the feeling they thought I was just looking around and probably had no money being so young. I finally walked over to the manager and he seemed a little annoyed. I noticed his name tag and it was the same as the store, so the owner turns out. I was the only customer in the place, what an idiot.

He quotes me a price on a piece of furniture and it was expensive but in my budget. He then made a snarky comment, something along the lines of betting I wished I could get furniture like that. 

I was already well on my way to quietly leaving his rude ass store, and going to my second choice, a store across town. Screw being quiet. I told him I had just bought a house and was there to buy furniture to fill that house today. His demeanor perked up and was suddenly very interested in me. 

I told him I hadn’t appreciated being ignored and that I knew why he hadn’t bothered to even say hello to me. 

I asked him for directions to his competitor. He was apologetic as I walked out, knowing he’d missed out on several thousands of dollars in sales.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8neibl/store_owner_ignores_me_gets_called_out_loses_huge/,pettyrevenge,378,0.0

I work in IT and have many coworkers, but one coworker gets so angry that I waste my valuable working time that he decides to spy on my PC from Impero console. 

Note, I don't play games at work anymore, and when I did, I would remote access into my PC at home to do a farm run or something on runescape.

Last week, there was 5 minutes left of my shift and I remoted into my PC at home to start up the game, and right then he says ""you know I can see your screen right? You aren't allowed to play RS at work"" and basically threatened to tell the boss. I know for a fact since he is my coworker it is against our companys computer use policy for him to spy on my PC at work because of our countries privacy issues etc. But instead of going to HR, I thought of another plan.

Today I acted really shifty on my PC and he walked past and saw I was remoted into my PC at home. I noticed in the bottom left corner of my host PC that Impero was booting, and so I had a nice view for him when he went into my PC. https://i.imgur.com/wqYzxwW.jpg

2018-05-28 20:41:44+00:00,3854,Grotesquely Misuse a Urinal in a Fine Establishment? You Will Be Shamed.,jdsailinger,"There will be no pics of this, as I’m not a disgusting filth monster.

I was having breakfast with friends in the restaurant of a 5 star hotel, a restored heritage, $500/night place.  Midway through, I wandered over to the washroom to make use of the single stall.  Having been on a sailboat for 3 days, I required a more than brief use of the facility.  

I heard the main door open and someone tried the stall door.  I happened to notice the intruder sported a rather loud pair of plaid socks under trousers with an aggressively fashionable break to the cuff.

After trying the door, the intruder grunted his disapproval and wandered away.  I heard an unzip followed by some unpleasant noise and then heard the main door open and close.  I guess he didn’t wash his hands, pretty gross.

Upon leaving the stall a few minutes later, I walked past the urinal on the way to the sink.  I now fully comprehended the reason for the intruders hasty exit - he must have felt hand washing was a luxury in his hurry to escape the scene of his foul crime.

I won’t go into details, but the urinal had been desecrated in a way that would require more than just a toilet brush and gloves.. This bathroom was going to be out of service for a while.  I noticed a curious and disturbing lack of toilet paper amongst the offensive leavings.

I slowly walked back to the restaurant and casually inspected the footwear of all of the other male patrons as I made my way to my table.  
As luck would have it, I spotted the sartorial peacock with his legs smartly (but unthinkably) crossed seated across from a striking young lady with long blonde hair, with whom he was passionately engaged in conversation.

Experience tells me  a woman like that, who wears her long hair straight to breakfast, and pairs that with 4” heels is likely to be higher maintenance than a fighter jet and nearly as expensive to keep.  She also likely demands military levels of hygiene from herself and her consorts.  

Having caught this gentleman brown-handed, I double checked his socks, shoes and pants before moving in.

Having spent the remainder of my bathroom visit imagining my response given this moment, I took a deep breath and laid my trap - 

I held out my wallet - 
“Pardon me, but I think you left something behind in the bathroom just now .”

He ran his bespoiled hands up and down the sides of his trousers until they came to rest on his own wallet.”

“Nope, I’ve got my wallet, must be someone else.”

I looked around furtively and leaned in so only him and his date could hear 

“I’m talking about how you took a shit in the urinal and didn’t even wash your hands...”

“What? No it....”
“I know it was you, I can tell by your socks.”

I walked back to my table and tried to finish my breakfast but my petty revenge on the miscreant mudslinger had left me quite satisfied.

2018-05-26 08:16:47+00:00,4061,My buddy said he was going to kill the man who was sleeping with his wife.,walksalot_talksalot,"Apologies for the length, I'll try to keep it as short as I can, but some context is needed. We are talking about murder here, even if petty.

Back in circa 2000 I was a US Navy Corpsman attached to a Marine Corps infantry unit. We ""Docs"" are the healthcare providers who are embedded with the Marines acting as paramedics/nurses/moms to the Marines. 

Every 6 months one of the four battalions on our base would deploy routinely to Okinawa and we would leave behind ""Okinawa widows"". We literally got a speech by our company gunny when we arrived in Okinawa, ""What happens on this island, stays on this island."" I found the speech sickening, but I was 21 and unmarried, so I didn't give it much thought. For those of you who never served in the US military, adultery is a pretty serious crime as we have our own criminal justice system and the punishment is disproportionately inflicted on the most junior of our ranks.

6 months after our deployment we return to our sandy base in the desert of southern California and my buddy discovers that his wife had been cheating on him. Me, my buddy, and his wife were all E-4 (3rd Class Petty Officers), but buddy's wife was sleeping with a Marine Gunny (E-7).

My buddy was obviously furious. He did all the right things, he reported it to our chain of command, his wife's chain of command, the Gunny's chain of command. But nothing happened. His complaints fell on deaf ears. Which is pretty fucked up because if he had been sleeping with a Gunny's wife, he would have been most definitely punished.

Distraught and defeated, a bunch of us were trying to console him one night at the enlisted club on base over beers. With tears in his eyes he looks up to the ceiling and declares, ""I'm gonna kill that sonofabitch."" Now, my buddy isn't the most ""military"" of our squad. He's a bit overweight and much more into video games than violence. After all, we were all Corpsmen, the medical caregivers, many of us were non-combatants. 

""Chill out dude. You're not going to kill him or anyone.""

""Yeah, you're probably right."" He replied. 

Fast forward to about a month later. We're all in the aid station for morning roll call, but buddy isn't there. He finally shows up just before lunch and I notice he's been demoted to E-3. He looks upset. We gather around him.

""Dude, what the hell?!""

""I told you, I was going to kill him.""

""You didn't kill anyone."" I retort. ""If you did, you wouldn't be sitting in that chair to tell us. What happened.""

""I told you. I killed him.""

Buddy was in charge of our health records computer system, which was connected to the base hospital. The day after we had the beers where he declared he would kill the Gunny. He went into the health records system and changed the Gunny's status to deceased, cause of death, venereal disease. 

3 weeks after he changed Gunny's record, the Gunny went for a check up and the hospital staff was very confused. And when the Gunny found out he was dead and how he died there was an investigation. So my buddy got charged and convicted of conduct unbecoming (or whatever). He got demoted a rank, lost half his pay for 6 months, and had extra duty assigned for 6 months.

2018-05-25 19:38:43+00:00,2419,"""You can kick me out over it."" Well, if you insist",aloneindankness,"About a year ago, I had a terrible housemate and a good housemate. Let's call the bad one, Bitch (B), and the other Other Housemate (OH). Here is an abbreviated list of how B was bad:

1) She had a little dog who would bark at EVERYTHING. A door in the house opened, knocking sound, doorbell, if I came home later than 10pm, etc. It was a small dog, and the barks were ear piercing.

2) She was possessive of space. She moved in after I had been there for over a year, but she claimed whatever space she was in. Like, if she was cooking, she would get irritated if we went into the living room/kitchen area, because she wanted to be alone.

3) She was angry. She would write scathing texts (one even made me fear for my life) about little things. I was honestly terrified of her, what she might do.

4) She played piano ALL the time. Literally every day. I asked her ONCE if she could play using headphones (not to stop, to play with headphones), because I needed some more sleep. She told me that playing piano was her thing, and I had known about it when she moved in, so I would have to deal with it.

5) She went to bed at 7-8pm and expected absolute quiet after that, but would wake up and play piano at 6 am without consideration to our needs.

6) She smoked weed in her room all day, every day, even after I specifically told her not to. (She could smoke it outside, I just didn't want to get in trouble with the landlords.)

7) She wouldn't clean. She said she couldn't touch other people's dishes (OCD) and that she would clean all of hers. That's fine, except she wouldn't always do her dishes. I ended up doing them often. She would also freak out if there was a single dish in the sink. She wouldn't put away dishes (not once!). She complained about things being messy, but wouldn't clean them (like mopping the floor or vacuuming up her dogs hair).

B had been living with me and OH for about 8 months when I ran out of patience.

I asked her to take out the recycling, as she hadn't done it in six weeks. (I knew it was 6 weeks, because it had been since before she went away for spring break, and it was the end of April when I texted her.) Below is a paraphrasing of our exchange. (Note: I am disabled, so taking out the recycling can be taxing. Especially since she would drink 3 glass bottles of beer (or more) A DAY. She said she didn't put them in the recycling bin, but I could literally see them on top.)

Me: Can you please take out the recycling?

B: Maybe... You guys don't stack it right, so it's pretty gross.

Me: Alright, that is something you should have told us before now, but fine. You don't have to take out the recycling. Just please don't put anything in there if you aren't going to take it out. Same goes for the trash. Like it or not, what you put in adds to it, and it can be painful for me to do.

B: I'm not putting anything in the trash or recycling (lie) and I never even go out of my room. When I do put things in the trash, I make sure it is compressed (true) and clean (not true). Also, there are too many standards I hold that are being unmet to mention them all so I cope how I can. I do plenty of washing (not true). I have put a bag in the recycling a couple times, but no one takes the hint (what?). (She then went on a rant about finals and OH bringing guests causing her stress).

Me: I know it has been six weeks, because (explanation). What standards aren't being met? You need to tell us these things. Like with the bags, I can't read your mind. I understand finals are stressful, but I can't do everything. And if you don't like the guests, you have to talk to OH about it. I can't stop her.

B: I don't care if it has been 6 weeks and like I said I don't put much in there, which you should know. (When I took out the trash that day, there were 6 beer bottles visible on top, let alone what was under everything else.) I was only telling you why I was frustrated. I'm just trying to tough it out until I am gone in two weeks (summer vacation). **And I'm not gonna take it out so theres that. *you could kick me out over it* but I'm not touching that.**

I honestly hadn't thought about kicking her out until that moment. I was honestly looking for other places to live. OH was moving out, so I was going to leave B with the job of replacing both of us, as she REFUSED to help find a new housemate to fill for OH, but she still wanted to vet all potential people. I waited one hour, talked to some friends, talked to OH, talked to my mom, and really thought it over. I let myself calm down completely and considered all my options. Finally, I sent her this:

Me: You know what B, fine. Be out by the end of May. You can keep the furniture that came with your room, if you would like.

She was furious, and she bitched me out about it over text for hours, but she couldn't do anything. She honestly hadn't thought I would kick her out, and she desperately tried to backtrack. She was living there off the lease (illegally), and I had evidence of her shit roommate behavior through our text exchange. She fucked me out of the last month's rent, and left the room a mess (bong water all over the ground, ugh), but she was gone by May 15, and I haven't heard from her since.

**TL;DR:** Terrible housemate pushed my buttons for too long. Finally, she did something that was the last straw. She told me I could ""kick her out over it,"" so I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8m4im6/you_can_kick_me_out_over_it_well_if_you_insist/,pettyrevenge,133,0.0
2018-05-24 17:21:26+00:00,3824,Gonna be a crappy girlfriend/ex? You just got outbid and now don’t get anything,Handtofacesnuggles,"So this happened to one of my husband’s close friends in college, and I’ve known about it forever but just realized what great petty revenge it is. (Sorry if formatting is weird—on mobile.) 

So this friend, B, dated this girl, S. B was/is a really nice and quiet type, definitely more on the sweet nerdy side. S, on the other hand, was that girl who just kind of all around sucked. She was selfish, immature, and shallow. An example of this is right after they broke up, B was in the cafeteria when S walked in with her friends. She sends a lackey over and demands B give back the hoodie that S gave him as a gift. Mind you, it’s winter and our college is up in the mountains—it is not mild weather. But, B just politely complied and takes the hoodie, that was a gift, off his back and hands it over to said lackey with only a t-shirt on for the rest of the day. Needless to say, neither him nor his group of friends (husband included) were very fond of S.

This is where is gets juicy. So, the RAs of the dorms throw a ton of socials throughout the semester, and every time you go to a social you get points. At the end of the year, the school has a huge auction that you can bid on items with your points. So the auction rolls around and S thinks she has the most points. At the end of the auction is the huge prize: an iPad mini, and it’s clear S is saving all of her points to outbid anyone else. She goes back and forth between another bidder, but eventually the other bidder has to drop out. The auctioneer calls out, “Going once! Going twice!” When suddenly B, out of completely nowhere and purposefully waiting until the last second, raises his hand and bids all of his points. Turns out S didn’t have nearly as many points as B, and she had no idea!! S whips her head around to see who outbid her, and when she sees it’s her ex, B, her eyes immediately widen and are blazing. She huffs around and starts spitting fire to her friends next to her. B won the iPad mini by a landslide and because S tried to save all her points for the end, she ended up not getting anything! My husband and all his friends were dying laughing in the bleachers with B in the middle looking very satisfied.

I had only ever spoken to this woman maybe 5 times ever and only small hello/goodbye type of talk. The dearly departed had once told me her aunt was crazy as a bat so I already knew what I was dealing with.

After a couple of this is so sad lines out came the crazy. She asked me if I thought the husband of dearly departed had what it took to take care of their kids. The woman had been sick for a while so he had been pretty much solo with them for a while and was a great father. She gave some explanation about herself just not knowing. I didn’t say a single word to make sure nothing would get twisted in her gnat brain, as she loved telling everyone about everything anyone said or did. Kept nothing to herself. I looked her directly in her eyeballs and without expression walked away and started giving my condolences. Unlike her I intended to keep her moronic statements to myself and would never have told a soul.

I found out a few days later that my lack of response freaked her out so bad, she went and told everyone in her family what she had said. She bit herself in the ass.

Side note: the deceased mother was already not to happy with her for taking a picture of her daughter in the casket, after she had asked permission and was told no.

So I was at the airport and going through the security lineup where they scan your bags and make you go through the body scan. 

Now for a little bit of background. I’ve learnt Chinese for 10 years at school, and while I’m definitely not fluent in it, I have an understanding of how to make sentences and know quite a few words. I should also mention that I’m white.

Anyways, as I was lining up to go through the scans this Chinese family of 5 people decide to push in front of me and began talking about me in Chinese. The mum of the family said something along the lines of “just push in front”, and I mean at this time I didn’t really care because it doesn’t bother me if I have to wait an extra few minutes since it’s not really worth the argument right. So I let them push in front. 

What they said next in Chinese however got me really angry. The Dad decided to say “she’s a monkey” really loudly, and when he said this their children looked at me, so clearly he was taking about me laughing.

Now since I’m white, they obviously thought that I had no understanding of Chinese. This is where the revenge comes in. I then decided to say in Chinese “I can speak Chinese, don’t think you can just disrespect me like that.” The shock on their faces was amazing, and it was definitely worth being insulted for. I then walked in front of them in the line and took my place back. They didn’t speak another word while we were waiting in the line. 

While I wish I could have said something more intricate and shocking, they were definitely embarrassed when they knew I could understand what they were saying. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8kzgum/talk_about_me_in_another_language_that_you_think/,pettyrevenge,327,0.0
2018-05-20 10:46:35+00:00,2899,Steal my bike? Right I'll get it back!,amberknightot,"TLDR at the bottom.

So I first moved to the Netherlands about 9 months ago and so bought a new bike once I got here. I found a local bike shop and got a nice one for €80 (too much in hindsight) and after some friendly chat with the guy in the shop giving out about bike thieves, he gave me a free chain for my lock. It was thick with a black covering, will never forget it.

Skip to 2 months later I come home tired with a bunch of shopping and leave my bike by the bike racks just outside my house. I honestly cannot remember whether or not I locked it but I hoped that I didn't (you'll know why in a bit). Next morning I rush out the door to get to uni and my bike is gone. I'm livid. I end up having to take the bus for almost a week (v expensive) and resort to buying a €10 shitty bike to save costs. Couldn't buy a better bike until about 2 months later. 

Report it to the police. Not much they can do. But I start devising a plan for an unlikely opportunity. I still had the key for that lock and I had hoped I left my bike unlocked. So I spend the next couple of weeks constantly eyeing every bike on the road, hoping to see my baby.

Skip forward to last week. Was sitting in the main sqaure with babe, having some ice cream. I start people watch and notice a couple (our age) park their bikes near enough to where we were sitting and disappear into the ice cream shop. And guess what caught my eye? My big thick black ""f#@k off"" lock. Turns out I never locked it and the person who stole it had left the lock on! Adrenaline kicks in as the details of my plan come back to me. Before I over think it, I walk over and lock my lock around the back wheel and come back to my seat. The other people sitting outside didn't take much notice of me.

It's some time before the couple come back out so we decide to chill on a curb nearby. The couple come back out and we're in earshot, but they can't see us. Convo goes like this (B boy, G girl). (They spent ages trying to find an explanations so this is just a short version of their convo)
B: Wtf???
G: Did some just put an extra lock on your bike?
B: Eh yeah. *starts to unlock his bike*
G: Wasnt that chain just hanging around your seat? *boy stays silent* Shit maybe the guy you stol- *quieter* took
it from locked it again.
B: Unlikely. I mean... Maybe someone cut the lock, got a new one and is just trying to mess with me? Yeah *more confidently*
I think Alan's trying to pay me back for yesterday!

Both laugh and seem pretty confident this is just a friends prank. I could not have wished it better! The guy leaves to go find a shop that sells bolt cutters but the girl stays to mind the bikes. Bae goes up to the girl and asks her for directions gets a little chatty, making the convo long enough for me to sneak around and quietly unlock the bike. My heart is PALPITAING, I'm surprised I'm not louder with my hands shaking so much. I click th lock closed after I've wrapped it around the bike seat; she's hears that and starts to yell. I hop on and before I know it I'm half way down the road and her cries die out in the distance.

I give a little woop! As relief washes over me.

Bae continued acting like a tourist even after I got the bike so the girl had no faces to report to the police. Poor guy though. Must have been awful to have your bike stolen.

This gas station required you to pay $1.00 but came with a pressure gauge. The gas station across the street had free air but no gauge. As I’m filling my tires a lady pulls up beside me and starts asking questions like how much it was to use, how much time, etc. I answered her questions as best I could but really was more focused on filling my tires since there was a time limit. My car has annoying warning lights that let you know if a tire is low even the spare and I hate when these sensors are lit up. The lady is still waiting there and is getting visible annoyed. This lady yells out, “will you hurry up! I’m in a rush!” I was confused for a second but quickly realized that she just wanted to use my time without paying. I did what any gentleman would do and proceeded to move slower. I pulled out of the spot and into a gas pump. She almost hit my car swooping in to where my car was. She jumps out and as she puts the air pump to her tire it shuts off. I guess I was smiling way too big because she as she jumped into her car and sped off she yells “fuck you” at me.

We visited each other. I got to know her. She had a boyfriend, but they didn't share that with many people. She was unemployed, so she received a lot of financial support. In my country you don't have to work at all, and live happy life. If you live only with your child, you receive single parent payment. If you cannot find job \(easy to convince ""government"", that you really try\), you get money for jobseekers. They also pay you for renting your house. From time to time I asked her to take care of my son, when I was working. I paid her for it, she also told me that other girl hires her as babysitter. After few months my son started to come home sad. He didn't want to go back to school. I asked what was happening. He said that X was the cause. He made a group of guys, and they laughed at my son, forced him to do things, blamed him for their pranks. I changed school, and I had to take my son to psychologist for making him as he was before. So, my small revenge time arrived: I reported her to government agency for welfare fraud. She worked as a babysitter, lived with boyfriend, and spent holidays abroad \(which is also forbidden for welfare recipients\). I gave so much details, boyfriend's name, FB account \(was hidden\).

2018-05-18 14:48:01+00:00,5619,"[NSFW] If you tease me in school, don't expect to get laid",DarkNymphetamine,"I remembered an incident of petty revenge while having a shower, and given the subject matter, I'll mark it NSFW just to be safe.

As mentioned in a prior post I've made, I have spent time working in brothels. Where I've worked, clients are shown to a waiting area, and the available girls show up one by one to introduce themselves, and once they're all done introducing, the client chooses the girl/s they want.

Because I remain unoriginal, I'll stick with calling the client John, though it's a different guy from the prior post.

John and I went to school together. I suppose he was a typical high school ~~idio~~boy; you know, bra snapping, ogling tits, etc. I feel frustrated now because he seemed nice enough otherwise, but... *boys*, am I right? I remember in eighth grade, one girl seemed to develop tits inside of a week, which was only remarkable because she was a DD cup when all us other girls were barely As, and they got everywhere before she did, or so it seemed. And of course John was rather an ass about it, like most of the boys were.

Well, it was high school, and we were in our teenage years, so we were all developing at different rates. But while the other boys were going after the girls with tits and trying to get into their panties, John seemed to think his time was better spent teasing me about how I was developing--or more accurately, wasn't. The girls were getting into actual bras and trying to buy more daring items than their parents would allow--and I only had a training bra because I wanted to fit in, not because I actually needed it.

I didn't know how to make him stop. I cried. I ignored him. I kicked him in the crotch once. It didn't change anything. The teachers weren't any help (I have this **fantastic** memory of a random guy snapping some other girl's bra strap so hard that it *may* have broken during a class, and the (female) teacher told the girl to stop disrupting the class with her tears). John eventually left the school later that year (I don't know or care why, but I do know it wasn't expulsion), and I started developing. By the time I graduated, I wasn't easily recognisable as the girl I'd been.

At risk of stating the obvious, it is a rare sex worker who uses her real name, so when John turned up at the brothel, he didn't know it was me, whereas I knew it was him. He was nervous--it was his first time at a brothel, he said. Now, obviously I don't **know**, but I really hope it was going to be his first time with a girl ever, because petty revenge.

The girls talk. Mostly about clients, but current personal lives, and histories can get bandied about. So they knew about the guy who'd teased me... and after some begging, and bribing, they agreed to do me a favour.

That day, John couldn't even pay to get a girl to have sex with him.

TL;DR: Guy teases me in school for not developing; years later comes to the brothel where I work, and I bribe the girls so no one will take him as a client.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8kdpxw/nsfw_if_you_tease_me_in_school_dont_expect_to_get/,pettyrevenge,403,0.0

I didn’t get in trouble, thankfully, as the teacher knows I wasn’t actually cheating (not to mention asshole didn’t know you could use a calculator later on in the test. But I was pissed off.

Flash forward to today. We have another test, but this time the teacher says it’s in two parts: one where you can’t use a calculator, another where you can. Halfway through the test, wadda ya know, asshole is unashamedly using his calculator on the first part. I could have shouted out like he did, but I’m generally a subtle person. I raised my hand to “ask a question”, and sure enough, while walking by, the teacher noticed him using his calculator. Now, he has detention for a week.

2018-05-16 23:41:26+00:00,8104,Your girlfriend is no longer impressed.,rsjpeckham,"Last week I rented a car to visit my girlfriend out of state, it wasn’t the normal type of car I’d get but since it’s warm out and I had money to blow, I might as well do it up big with a 2018 Ford Mustang convertible. The trip was a 2 1/2 hour drive to her and I know this highway like the back of my hand since I traverse it often.

Half way through the journey, a navy blue Charger greeted me and asked to measure dicks, I declined, he sped up and got in my lane for a break check, I changed lane and tried to put some distance between us but the gentlemen was determined to reenact Fast and Furious. The man, probably in his early 20s, golden hair compressed under a Lakers cap, with who I assume to be his girlfriend in the passenger seat, trying everything from matching my speed and rev’d his engines, blowing kisses, and locking eyes with his tongue out doing what I can only describe as ravenously licking a lollipop. This kept on for about half an hour. Fortunately, he was too focused on me to notice a street sign warning travelers of the State Police station a mile out. By then I’ve about had it and wanted nothing more than to embarrass this kid in front of his girlfriend, so I feigned interest in the race. I rev’d my Mustang, sped up to put him in my rear view mirror, and made sure he knows he’s about to eat my dust. Sure enough he took the bait and put his lead foot to use. It wasn’t long before his taillights faded into the horizon.

This police station I’ve passed by plenty of times before and there’s usually one or two eagle eyed staties on watch, parked near the highway entrance ready to pounce. I witnessed a crazy police chase last year with these troopers involved so I’m sure they mean business. Once again I passed the station with no irregularities except, this time, the eagles have left the nest. A few minutes later, the trees and atmosphere became awash with blue and red, cars ahead and behind me slowed to a crawl. My racing buddy and his navy blue Charger now has a brother; it was another Charger, also blue, but this one has no intentions of racing. The kid is still in his car as I roll by, making sure to make eye contact with him and his now unimpressed girlfriend, and to be extra petty about it, blew her a kiss. 

I made it to my own girlfriend’s house an hour later with just in time to catch the last showing of Avengers: Infinity War. It was a good day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8jzm48/your_girlfriend_is_no_longer_impressed/,pettyrevenge,378,0.0

It takes place in Japan, where the morning train commutes are infamously packed, and you're lucky to get a seat at all. I usually manage to find one, though, if only because my station is way up the line, away from the city center.

One day, I notice a woman down by the doors-- she's kind of squatting, kind of leaning back, maybe sitting on the bags she's brought. I was getting off at the next stop anyway, so I stand up and offer her my seat. Call my old-fashioned, but I give my seat up for women, and this particular lady looked a bit heavier and out of breath.

I was completely surprised by her reaction. She had the most annoyed face I'd ever seen on a commuter, and she angrily rejected the seat. Was she annoyed at me? Did she assume I assumed she was pregnant? Or did she assume I assumed she was an older lady? I honestly had and have no clue what bothered her so much about the gesture, and I recall recoiling a step back, because of how curt she was. Whatever. I turned to another nearby commuter, a younger woman who quietly took the seat, bobbing her head in thanks.

I then stood by the doors, holding the commuter straps near the angry older woman, and silently let out the fart I was holding in for the last few minutes. Right into her face. Seconds later, I'm at my station and I sprightly escape onto the station platform just as I was catching the first fetid hints of the bomb I laid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8jv577/dont_want_my_train_seat_fine_but_no_need_to_be/,pettyrevenge,134,0.0

I wanted to get lunch before my lecture and went to a shop close to my university. Like everybody else, I stood in line when a guy and his family decided to just step in front of me. A‘ight, maybe they didn‘t see me? Happens all the time.
Me:„Excuse me?“ no reaction from either of them. Well then.
„EXCUSE ME?“
Guy:*looks at me like I was a pile of dog shit he just stepped in*
Me:“I was actually in front of you“
Guy: *Looks away and keeps talking to his wife*
At this point I was hangry, tired and very pissed off. Also, nobody stands between me and my food.
They took _forever_ to decide what to get for themselves and their little kids, which were either high on speed or six tablespoons of sugar. They were running around and screeching like crazy. I noticed the guy parking a stroller next to an empty table and going back to his wife who was still standing in line.

I actually got my food before them (since they were four people and had a bigger order)and sat down. Now normally that would have been the point were I would just go on with my day but that dude was fucking rude. I was munching away when two men pointed to the table where the stroller was standing and asked me „Sorry, do you know if someone is sitting there?“. I saw my opportunity for revenge.

 With much glee I told them „No, I don‘t think so actually. They just finished eating. They’ll probably be back in a second.“ They thanked me and rolled the stroller out of the way to sit down. I had to hold back my laughter when the guy came back minutes later with four plates of food, two hungry kids, and his wife just to see that their table was taken. Fortunately, he just glared in the general direction of the two men, his wife got the stroller, and then he went looking for a new table accompanied by his screaming kids and a nagging wife (I thought you saved us a table??!?). Since the place was pretty busy, it took about 5 five minutes to find a table for four people. Felt kind of sorry for his kids, but you don‘t fuck with me when I‘m hungry.

I was walking back to my bike with my helmet in hand, and I guess this woman put two and two together and realized the motorcycle was mine.  So she sits there and waits as I'm walking back to my bike.  I'm not even there yet, but she's going to wait.

Normally, I'll hurry and give up the parking spot because this lot gets busy at lunch.  But the thing that irritated me was, in the parking spot next to my bike was a small car, and beside that car was the next empty parking spot.  It wasn't hidden or obscure.  There's no way she didn't see it.  I guess this woman just wanted the first parking spot really badly.

Much to her displeasure, I can't just jump on my bike and leave in an instant.  I have to dig my key chain out, find the small motorcycle key and unlatch it.  I have to put on my helmet and strap it.  I have to put on my gloves.  All while under the watchful eye of the Parking Spot Vulture.  

I hear her engine rev slightly as I'm finishing with my gear, and I figure she's decided to drive the 10 extra feet to the next spot, but nope, she's still sitting there watching me.

I play aloof. ""Oh, no, I'm waiting for someone, sorry!""

So I have a grandmother and step-grandmother on my father's side. This divorce and marriage took place before I was born. I'll call her SGM from now on. 

The relation between SGM and my dad was never really warm, their personalities don't really match. She's very much a 'keeping up appearances' person. But we got along ok. 
In the last few years, the health of my grandfather was getting worse. He had difficulty moving around, and become forgetful. SGM was playing martyr loudly, how much she had to sacrifice for him, and how much she did for him, and how my father wasn't nice enough for her, and how he didn't visit enough. My grandfather always chose her side. At some point, there was even no contact anymore between my father and him and SGM. My father decided to give in because he figured out that his father wouldn't be around for much longer and he wanted to make the most of the time that was left. 
So my grandfather died, and my father and SGM work together for the ceremony and the relation seems to be a bit better. 
...And a month later he learns he has been disinhertited, can't even get a photo album, and his father's ashes have been scattered without him having even been involved. And SGM also doesn't want to tell where the ashes have been scattered. Because apparently, my father didn't contact her enough and she saw that as a sign of 'bitterness'. 

So here is the petty revenge: I have always maintained some form of contact with SGM. I'm the only grandchild that does this. I'm one of the very few people who will still call her. She LOVES me, because I don't contradict her. But I don't play nice because I like her. I play nice for situations like this. 
I called her last evening, when I had learned about the ashes. Getting the location of the ashes out of her was no problem. I made an appointment with her to go through the old photoalbums 'so we can talk more about grandpa'. The real reason: scan all the pictures and give them to my dad. She also tells lies about my dad to me, and I just nod along, but don't believe her. 

Yes SGM. Your most dearest friend (me) doesn't even like you, but just uses the contact she has with you to get info and items you are withholding from your late husband's son. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8jas3r/stepgrandmother_is_bitch_gets_manipulated_in/,pettyrevenge,173,0.0

Inside I'm fuming. Of course I want that seat. It's the reason I booked the seat. But don't worry seat stealer I'll just sit in the middle while you enjoy the window.

So the usual flight stuff happens, everyone else boards and the plane doors are closed. At this point the aisle guy disappears. Like a ninja he is gone. Must have been an empty set near his family. Start of my pettyness. In this situation you would usually move to the aisle seat and give window stealer and yourself more room, but I didnt. I kept my middle seat. I completely utilised the extra aisle seat. My bottle of water had a very comfortable position as did my mobile phone which I listened to audio books with. All the time leaning straight over seat stealer to look out the window. I mean she couldn't complain, she had my extra leg room and my window, she couldn't complain about me wanting to take a look. 

So the next thing to arrive after take off is my meal. I had to explain that it was my meal as seat stealer hadn't ordered anything. At which point all the paperwork had to come out to confirm it was me who had ordered it and not the old granny in my seat. After a long wait I was eventually given my food and I started eating. Using both my drop down table and the empty seats drop down table next to me. All my rubbish went on the extra table while only the thing I was eating on my table. Again all the time leaning over to look out of my window and being extra elbowy while cutting my food. 

Then my favourite part. As I'm finishing my meal the young mother who had boarded about the same time and was sat in front of me got up and started moving around awkwardly in her seat and the aisle. I realised she had her young baby on her lap and not in its own seat. Well what could I do but offer her the extra space so they could both have a seat. The young mother was over the moon and just keot saying thank you. She had all the extra seat of room. I looked over at seat stealer as the baby was sat into the seat next to her and she looked disgusted at this messy baby throwing his arms about in his nice new big seat. 

I just smiled and went back to my audio books for the rest of the flight. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8iv0j3/steal_my_seat_ok_have_my_revenge/,pettyrevenge,195,0.0
2018-05-10 16:04:53+00:00,4847,Kiss your promotion goodbye,mle731,"Years ago, I was an assistant director for a center (of a pretty prominent preschool chain).  It was my first time being promoted to a management position from being a teacher for many years, so it took me a few months to get into the swing of things.  During this time, a particular teacher at the center took it upon herself to highlight every little thing I forgot or didn't distribute in time, barricading herself in the director's office almost daily with complaints.  She also spread (false) rumors about my partying on the weekends to other teachers, trying to paint me out to be an unprofessional fool... while continuing to be sugary sweet to my face the entire time.  This I really took issue with, because I take my job very seriously.  I was too unconfrontational of a person to directly address her (which I regret now in hindsight).  I had to oversee graduations that year, and spent many long nights hand-preparing decor, creating the slideshow, etc.  In the aftermath, she told the director that I didn't lift a finger.  After a very lengthy conversation with my director, she told me that she was starting to see that this teacher ""probably wanted my job"" so she was trying to poke holes in my job performance. 

Fast forward a year, and I've hit my stride with my job.  The owners of my school decided to open a second center, which meant they needed to hire a new management team for that school.  After they hired the new director, they decided to hold internal interviews for an assistant director.  The owner, my director, and the new director asked me to sit in on the interviews since I would be the one training them in their role (which would mirror mine).  Guess who walks through the door as the second interview?  I wish I could have taken a picture of the look on her face when she saw me in her panel interview.  The new director and owner liked her in the interview but listened to my suggestion that she ""wasn't ready"" for a management position and hired someone that I recommended (whom I ended up getting along really well with).  I left that school for a director position several years ago, but last I heard she still hasn't made it into a management position.

Parking is limited in this plaza during lunch hours, so the restaurant owner has her staff put out her cone at around 11 to make sure that when she has parking during the lunch hour. Management didn’t like it, nor did anyone else in the plaza... so management then sent out a notice to remind everyone in the plaza that all parking spots are first come first serve, there is no designated parking. 

Restaurant owner ignores this, and continues to place the cone there. Plaza management was not having it, sends out another notice, this time saying that all objects used to save a parking spot will be confiscated and will only be returned for an administrative fee. 

This morning, I watched the owner of a separate restaurant park in that exact spot where the cone usually is - the rest of the lot is completely empty, and the spots in front of his own restaurant are also empty. He then proceeded to unload his trunk of materials (looked heavy, but damn if he didn’t want to make a statement) and walk the extra 15 steps to his own restaurant 😂 it is still parked there, and the lunch rush is now over 😂

Outside, two guys stepped out of a car with a Lithuanian plate number (this happened in the Netherlands), picked several bags from the car and walked towards the building doors. I was observing them the whole time, and thought that I recognized one of the men to be living in the building.

To get inside the building, you either need an old-school key or an electronic one. Upon seeing them walk towards the door, I also went towards the large button that can automatically open the door for them. They saw me doing so. I thought I was being welcoming to foreigners. As a foreigner myself in this country (originally from the Philippines), small acts of kindness mattered to me.  Both men walked inside with their clunky luggages. Neither of them even acknowledged my presence. I was livid.

I saw both men went outside after a couple of minutes, and seeing that they were picking up more luggage, I swore to myself I won't open the door for them anymore. I was seething. They stood at the door, struggled looking for their keys while doing a balancing act with their bags. I just stared at them.

My Wife, two young boys (6 and 4), and I were on vacation in Myrtle Beach last week and are on our way back home to Metro Detroit. In total, it’s an approximate 13 hr drive (road time) start to finish. However, with young kids we have to stop every few hours to stretch legs and burn energy. Therefore, we split the drive into one really long day and another shorter day. 

On top of this the boys have soccer this morning starting at 9:30am back home. So stopping our first day’s drive in Columbus left us a 3.5 hr drive this morning. Doing the maths we needed to leave by 6:00am to account for 30 minutes of fluff time to stretch/get gas/etc. 

Up until bed time everything was perfect. We pumped out 12 hrs of travel time, the hotel had a nice restaurant for us to grab a bite, then the boys did cannonballs in the pool until 9:15pm. There wasn’t even an argument to get out of the pool and go to bed. Heads hit the pillows by 9:30 and off into the night. 

Then, the adjacent neighbors get to their room. Starting at 10:15 they begin opening and closing their door while letting it slam multiple times. Seemingly drunk they continue to hysterically laugh and shout among each other and wake us all up. This continued for about an hour at which time my Wife calls the front desk who assured they will take care of it. Another 30 minutes goes by, never heard a phone ring or a knock on the door, the noise continued. So she calls the desk again who said they had stopped by and will follow up with a phone call. Another 30 minutes goes by and the shouting becomes just talking. Still annoying but manageable. Then the other neighbors get to their room...

These people share the wall by our headboard and even the talking is unbearable. So at around 12:30am, we have the first side with mild chatter and the new side back to phase 1 of drunken laughing and shouting. In disbelief my Wife again calls the front desk around 1:30 to complain about the new room. Again, never heard a visit to the room or a phone ring and the noise continues. 

Another 30 minutes goes by and she calls again. This time we hear the knock on their door. Excellent, finally some follow through. As soon as the door shuts we hear the neighbors knocking on our wall. Clearly intentional and assumed to mock us or something. 

At this point, fuck everyone around us. I’m so tired and we have to get up in less than 4 hrs to drive directly to soccer. My mind is racing on how I can screw these people’s sleep. It came to me. 

I set 2 alarms on the clock-radio; one for 6:30am and one for 7:00am. The super loud and annoying alarm that everyone knows. It goes, “EGH-EGH-EGH-EGH-...” I then stood the clock-radio on its face and butted the speaker directly flush with the shared wall I know their heads were at. 

They will need to call the front desk in order to get it turned off unless they just ride the first one out. I doubt they would ride 2 alarms out...

I also didn’t physically check out at the front desk, so as far as they know we are still in there. Hopefully slowing down the process of getting in to turn it off.

I have a sensitivity/intolerance to most meats. Red meat is the worst, and beef is particularly bad. Doctors recommended I try to get my protein from alternative sources if possible, so I’ve happily been a vegetarian since I was 13 or so. 


When I was younger, my aunt did not believe the doctors, and thought I was just being fussy. We come from a meat and potatoes town, so she had plenty of friends backing her up on this. This is the same aunt who convinced my parents I was faking asthma (turns out, I wasn’t...shocker), and also refused to get her own daughter glasses because she thought she just wanted them for attention (she later discovered her daughter’s eyesight was atrocious... another shocker, I know). 

The whole family regularly had dinner together, taking turns hosting. When it was my aunt’s turn to host she assured me my burger was meatless. As you probably guessed, it was not.


I was starving that night and gulped down my (beef) burger first. My aunt was smiling, and I thought it was simply because I liked her cooking. Looking back, I realize her little smirk was because she thought she had caught me in a lie or achieved whatever her end game was.


Well, a few minutes passed and I got that familiar, unpleasant feeling in my stomach. It was then that I realized what she had done, and why she was smiling.


When I eat meat, I almost always get sick. I just can’t hold it down.


So, when it came time to kneel before the porcelain throne, I decided to stay put. I instead took aim at my aunt, who was seated beside me at the head of the table.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8h0nqv/my_aunt_ruined_my_dinner_so_i_ruined_hers/,pettyrevenge,755,0.0

I'm a cashier a small grocery store. It's a local place with a lot of regulars. There's a bakery and deli in the back that is THE place to get food/doughnuts in the whole county. It's been family owned and operated for the past 30 years.

I've worked here for about 1 year. The food is excellent, the staff are amazing; and the customers are my friends and neighbors.

Because this place is 30 years old and family owned, a lot of the staff are starting to retire and hand things off to the next generation. The current owner (we'll call her Kelly) who is the daughter of the man who built the place, was recently diagnosed with cancer. She's doing fine but the store is very fast paced because we have a small staff.

Kelly decided to hire a manager from outside the family to help run the place while she is in treatment. There are many things I'd like to call or new manager but we'll call her ""Brenda"". Brenda and I went to school together. We never really interacted much but what i do know is she's a controlling, micromanaging bitch.

Brenda is only 21 but has an associate's in accounting and is trying to gain some experience in order to get a better job. This is fine as Kelly really only needs her to keep the books straight while she is sick.

Remember how I said she's controlling? He first day on her own she sent the head of the bakery home because he was wearing ""non-handbook complaint"" shoes.

Our handbook is some generic, small business, thing made by some other company for stores like ours. We barely follow it (even the owner) and most of us didn't even know it existed.

Brenda had been working with me for about a week learning the register. For the most part there was no issues until one day a newer cashier asked why my uniform didn't have a anything printed on it.

I explained when Kelly only ordered shirts once a year (more like every two) and when she placed her last order she only ordered up to 2XL and I need a 3X so I just got a blue polo in the same style.

Now, the reason for this is I'm very busty. Kelly is pretty cool and just said i can wear a plain polo until she makes another order. I actually looked at the tag so I could by the same brand and shade of blue.

Brenda was pissed. ""So you think you can just wear what ever you want?! You need to be wearing a company issued uniform.""

I said ""they don't fit. Kelly let's me wear these""

""That's ridiculous. Nobody gets special treatment""

""Ya but...""

""I don't care! Your going to wear one!""

She pulled a 1XL out of the back and the it at me. ""I'm going to lunch. That better be on when I get back.""

So I put it on. Needless to say it looked ridiculous. I could even come close to buttoning it up. And pulling it down to cover my mid section meant showing a LOT of cleavage.

When I came back to the office the other cashier's mouths dropped. ""Dude. You can't fight wear that on the floor!"" Well, I'm gonna.

About an hour and a half into Brenda's usual 2hour lunch Kelly comes into the store furious and red faced. Apparently, people had been calling her directly at home and complaining. ""Charlie! What the actual fuck are you wearing! You look like a God Damn hooker!""

I explained everything to Kelly and how awful Brenda had been to us all. Then I said she left an hour and a half ago and she'll be back in 30 min. When I said this Kelly broke. She couldn't make words and just made confused sounds instead.

""Off the floor. Now."" She called Brenda who came back almost immediately. She took one look at me and get eyes bugged out of her head. I stuck my chest out for effect. Then she looked at Kelly and when white as a ghost.

Kelly calmly said ""Everyone, even management, gets a 30 min break. Clearly your not able to make the decisions required by your position. You're fired.""

After Brenda left she turned to me and said I should never pull a stunt like this again",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8gjvjw/you_giant_to_wear_the_company_issued_uniform_well/,pettyrevenge,116,0.0

One of the rules here is that you can’t leave trash/items you want to get rid of in the hallway. This is for 3 reasons: 1. It’s technically a luxury apartment and no one wants to see the hallways cluttered up 2. I live in an area where cockroaches invade easily and leaving garbage laying around is a good way to attract them 3. It’s a fire hazard.

There is a neighbor a couple doors over who once left a very large sofa along with several storage bins and a flat a screen tv all piled up in the hall. Now—I’m not a complete asshole and if it was just for a few days because you’re moving or whatever—fine. No problem. After it being there a week, I called the office to complain. Throughout the week, more stuff was added to the pile and you could barely get through the hallway anymore. This went on for 3 weeks! After several complaints, apartment management told me they were applying fines to this lady’s account every day the stuff was left there and that’s all they could do. Finally, one day it was all gone. 

Problem solved. Or so I thought...

A few days later I notice a bag of smelly garbage and an old dresser drawer outside the same apartment. Again, I give her the benefit of the doubt...maybe she’s on her way out and will take it with her. Day 2: trash and drawer still there. Day 3: no change. End of day 3: fuck this asshole. 

I took the drawer and leaned it against her door so it fell inside when she opened the door. The top of her garbage was also not tied up so I gave it a little shove letting it spill it’s putrid contents on her doormat. I passed by a few hours later and someone must have been on the same page as me because the garbage was further kicked all over the hallway. Later on that day, I’m coming back from walking my dog and I hear cussing and swearing and a door slam. It was her. She was pissed she had to clean the mess. 

All of this was a few months ago. Nothing has been left in the hallway since. I think she finally learned her lesson. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8g98hr/leave_half_of_your_living_room_in_the_hallway_for/,pettyrevenge,78,0.0

So I am in a forensics class and I also take a government class (relevant later) and I share those two classes with a group of five other people.

 In my forensics class there is a girl (we'll call O) who likes to take my work, she'll sometimes take it as I'm working on it, and copy all of the work while questioning our competency and also contributing nothing to the groups. 

Now, I'm a person who is fatally loyal, so when everyone else gave up on working with O I still let her ""work"" with me.

Now this bothered me, but everyone needs a friend, so I tried to ignore it.

After a few times of being snubbed by O, I stopped with the niceties, but still let her work with me. On one particularly important and busy lab I was working on a my paper when O took it out of my hands as I was writing on it. Now I had had enough. As I said earlier, there was another group of people who I was friends with from my government class, so I took my paper back from O while she was copying it and joined my government buddies, leaving O to do the rest of the lab on her own.

With nobody to copy off of anymore, and having never paid attention to the lectures, O failed the lab.

I talked about the situation with my new lab group and as it turns out she had done this kind of thing with each of them as well as most of the forensics class. Now nobody will work with her and because she doesn't pay attention to the lectures, she fails most labs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8g4rjl/try_to_steal_everyones_work_and_snub_us_outside/,pettyrevenge,130,0.0

Backstory:
So I’ve always been a little bit awkward when it comes to social situations. It’s not terrible but the way I’m just a bit shy. So I’ve been working at a new job for about year now it forces me to meet all kinds of people from different backgrounds so I’ve grown out of the shyness but I still have to warm up to people before I start to really get to know them. I’ve gotten close to a couple of people (let’s call them jack and John) and we hang out quite a bit. Now I’m the only one who has a car due to our work which causes us to travel a bit and they are from  a different state. We live in the same building and I would drive them to work and stuff like that. So Jack and John both went to visit home. Jack gets back, I pick him up at the airport and we hang out for a few days, then John gets back and we hung out and shit. Now I’m the type of person where if you need something I’ll help you out and I don’t expect anything in return, but the amount of driving I’ve been doing for them is starting to add up, but I still never said anything. So last weekend rolled around and I asked them if they had any plans and they said no so I tried to make some with them but they didn’t want “to do anything” so I said ok and did nothing the whole weekend. I get a text from this chick at work who I’ve had a bit thing for telling me that I hope I feel better. I said I’m fine and asked why she asked me that and she told that jack and John said I had the flu and couldn’t make it. I told her I didn’t and was perfectly healthy. I get notification on instagram from a post she tagged me in with my two best friends drunk on boat with a bunch of my co workers. She said that they thought all three of had been planning it for a while, and I told her I had no idea about it. Well they get back and act like nothing happened. I’m pissed. I drive their asses everywhere without asking them for gas. They could at least have told me about it I just felt kinda let down.


Here’s to the pettiness: 
They usually meet at my car in the morning at specific time. So I go out and walk to my car and they’re both there. I don’t know if this is for all cars but my car you can unlock the driver door with the key first without the rest of the car unlocking. So, I got in without them, started the car, and drove off with them standing in the parking lot. Don’t fuck with my kindness people.

I didn't have all that much stuff, but enough that I didn't want to go through the self-checkout. As I walked up to the two open lanes, I saw that both were serving folks with giant loads, probably commercial customers, but both were nearly done. I also saw Asshole Customer.

AC was clearly impatient, and had his cart parked diagonally across both lanes (one end in the Member side of one lane, the other in the Cart side of the other lane). I didn't want to guess wrong and cut in front of the lane he meant to be using, just in case he was accidentally sending his cart down the Member side, so I said:

&gt; me: Excuse me, sir, which lane are you in?

&gt; AC: *grumpily* Both. I've been standing here a long time and I'm gonna take whichever one opens first.

&gt; me: well typically folks would get in line.

&gt; AC: Well I'm not going to, because I've got places to be and things to do. Is that OK?

Now, I'm not in a hurry; I don't do hurry, it rarely gets you anywhere faster and if often slows you down, so I've literally got all day. But I'd rather spend it with my family or playing video games (or playing video games with my family) instead of talking to the police department about a fist fight in Clam's Sub, so I decide to just push him a tiny bit more and then let it go.

&gt; me: No, but I'm not going to do anything about it.

&gt; AC: Good.

At that moment, a passing employee who had seen the exchange walks closely behind me and opens the register right next to me.

&gt; her: I'll get you over here, sir.

&gt; me: Thanks.

&gt; her: *whispers* I did that on purpose.

2018-04-27 03:34:26+00:00,2227,Handcuff yourself and not come back to your job for an hour? Enjoy being unemployed.,underscorecarl,"This happened around a week ago. I work at a sandwich delivery store. Most of the time it's pretty chill there. During lunch however, it tends to get super busy. A trademark of the shop I work at is the speed at which we deliver, and as we have our speedy reputation to uphold, we need to staff plenty of delivery drivers to combat the lunch rush. All of my coworkers are great. All work really hard, know what they're doing, and are all really awesome people. I've never had any issues with any of them the seven or so months I've worked there. That is until one delivery driver, who I'm just going to call Meathead, walked in the door.

From day one, Meathead was a total dick. He answered a phone and took somebody's order for a delivery. He said that it'd be out in 5 or 10 minutes. Since I'd worked there so long, I knew that during lunch sandwiches take 5 minutes to leave the store max, and traffic is normally pretty bad, so I tried to tell him to instead say something like ""we'll have that out to you as soon as we can
!"", that way customers are surprised if we get there fast and will be more understanding if it takes longer than normal. Before I even finished my sentence, he stopped me and said that ""I've worked plenty of delivery jobs before. I don't need your help bud.""

A few weeks go by. Meathead continues working and being a nuisance to everybody. He forgets things for his deliveries, sings obnoxiously while sitting around in the store while deliveries are piling up, takes super long on his deliveries, and constantly just doesn't do his job anywhere near as much as he should. People started to dislike him, most of all me. One day, we were taking deliveries going down the same main road our store sits on. I was behind a truck, and he was in the left lane behind me. I switched lanes safely, took my delivery, and didn't think anything of me merging in front of him. Later in the day, since delivery driving is so in and out, Meathead asked me if I'd gotten pulled over at all. I asked him what he was talking about. ""Oh you totally cut me off earlier on that one delivery, so I called my buddy who's a cop, gave him your plate number, and told him to pull you over haha. Funny joke right?"". I was fucking livid. I already didn't like him, but this put me over the edge; I was out to get him now.

A week or so passes. Meathead decides it'd be really funny to show a coworker of ours how easy it is to get out of handcuffs. He handcuffs both handcuffs to one wrist, similarly to a bracelet. He tried to get them off, but he couldn't. Obviously that's pretty stupid, but he could still drive and had full mobility of both arms. While that was all happening, we had a delivery come up, and it was his turn to take it. ""Hey Meathead, you've got a delivery up."" He said ok. He walks out to his car, and I figured he'd taken the delivery with him. 10 minutes later, I see the delivery sitting on a table in the lobby. I run him the delivery and tell him to take the delivery, which he does. To where this delivery was going, it was right on the edge of our delivery zone, so when 30 minutes passed and he wasn't back, I didn't really suspect anything. Another 15 minutes passed and he still wasn't back. I called him multiple times and he never picked up. An hour had passed, and we were fairly busy, and I was the only other driver, so I was having to take lots of deliveries. On my way back from a delivery, I saw his car parked outside a gas station. I pulled over to try and figure out where the hell this guy'd been, and he runs out of the gas station as soon as he sees me. I asked him where the hell he'd been, and he made a bullshit excuse up that he'd gone to the police to get his handcuffs off, but of course they couldn't get their own handcuffs off, so the fire department had to get them off for him. In addition to this, he'd apparently gotten his phone stolen, which I found out later was a lie. He finally gets back to the store, and explained what happened to our manager, who obviously wasn't thrilled he'd screwed us over for a whole hour for a self-inflicted problem which wasn't preventing him from doing his job.

At the end of their shifts, managers at my store need to send out emails describing what'd happened during their shift. I asked my manager if I could write it instead. These emails go to the General Manager, the store owner, and the District Manager. She had no issue letting me describe in detail all of the idiotic tendencies Meathead had. 

Meathead left a few days after to try and get into the military again. Meathead got a text from my General Manager a few days from when he was due back that he didn't have a job anymore. He might have gotten fired regardless of if I wrote the email or not, but god damn did it feel good to fuck him out of his job more or less.

**TLDR: Delivery driver thinks he's hot shit while he's awful at his job. Double handcuffs one wrist, gets his handcuffs off while on the clock. I write up the email that gets him fired.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8f8o7y/handcuff_yourself_and_not_come_back_to_your_job/,pettyrevenge,108,0.0

There is a really mean old, sour woman at work that no one likes.  She doesn't give a hoot about her attitude, or how she treats others like crap, and her work ethic sucks.  

I won't go into the details of how she's pissed off everybody in the office, that would take too long, so I'll just skip to the good part on how I inconvenience her and annoy her every single day.

Every day at exactly 10:00, she gets up from her desk and goes to the kitchen to fill up the kettle to boil water for her tea.  As the kettle is boiling, she goes to the bathroom, then outside for a cigarette.

She has to walk by my desk to do all this, and as soon as she gets on the elevator to go for her smoke, I head to the kitchen and dump out the entire contents of the kettle down the drain.

She then comes back to an empty kettle, and can't make her tea.  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

She then has to waste more time waiting around for the kettle to boil again, which means that she has to make up this wasted time by working into her lunch hour, or working a bit later in the day.

When I started doing this, I heard her talking to someone about how she thinks she's ""loosing her sanity"" because she could have sworn she put the kettle on!   LOL  

By now I'm sure she's clued in that someone is messing with her, but with an office of 300 people, there's no way to lay the blame.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8f2xwq/if_youre_a_mean_old_hag_to_everyone_and_ill/,pettyrevenge,100,0.0
2018-04-26 03:18:34+00:00,2192,Laundry time,dalilampa,"So this happened a couple weeks ago. My apartment building has a laundry room in the basement that houses about 20 units (and 10 dryers). On any normal weekday there are hardly any people using them so I go down there to do just two loads. Except when I got there,  ALL of the machines were in use with a woman fiddling with her iPhone and keeping a watchful eye. I cut my losses and returned upstairs only to come back a few hours later to find her still there and not even close to done. I give the machines a quick glance at their timers and they had just only begun doing their x-number of loads. I asked her when she will be done but she just ignores me.                     

Slightly fuming for having monopolized my day (yeah, I could've timeslotted myself better) I decide to visit a third time which thankfully the laundry room is now completely cleared out. Except for one thing: she left her iPhone and earbuds on top of one of the machines. So before doing my laundry, I went upstairs to the manager's office and turned the phone in to the lost&amp;found. The manager was just about to leave for a week-long vacation so he accepted it and locked the door behind him. I bid him a farewell knowing that someone in our building will probably lose her mind finding the damn thing.

2018-04-25 07:51:30+00:00,3821,I wouldn’t have done anything if she wasn’t rude.,Bulbapuppaur,"LTL, FTP, on mobile, etc. 

I am a commuting student at a university. The lot that I park in has a very high volume of cars looking for spots, and not enough spots for commuters. 

Since it snows a lot, I can forgive accidental minor multi-space parking when students can’t see the lines. 

It was not snowy this morning. In fact, it was really warm. 

So when this girl was as multi-space parked as possible, I was a little bit upset. She had an average sized sedan parked directly on the line between two spots. 

I was irritated, but I slowed down and called to her “Do you know you’re in two spots?” She looked at me, but didn’t answer, got her backpack out of her trunk, and started walking to class. 

Okay, maybe she didn’t hear me. So I parked and managed to catch up to her, and asked her again, with my best customer service voice: “Miss, did you know you’re parked in two spots?”

All she responded with was “uhn.”

Seriously? She grunted at me? Fine. She knows she’s multi-space parked and has no intentions of fixing it. I googled if it was a ticketable offense, and found that this is usually up to the officer that catches it and often depends on how inconvenient it is for others. 

So I emailed our campus parking services and told them what lot she’s in, the kind of car she has, and about our interaction, showing she has no intention of correcting it. They responded and told me there had been more than one complaint about it. 

When I left for lunch, she had a ticket. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8erubm/i_wouldnt_have_done_anything_if_she_wasnt_rude/,pettyrevenge,107,0.0

Douche was a douche for a number of reasons. He worked with my dad in IT who said he had a hero complex where he would cause disasters at work and then try to be the hero and “save the day.” We even suspect he caused a huge IT disaster at our national airport while he was working there. He was also really creepy, he creeped on my younger sister, calling her randomly and asking to pick her up. He was the exact opposite of his wife who was lovely and sweet and charismatic and I have no idea how they ended up together. 

Unfortunately, a while after we made friends with them, Heidi got very sick. Her colon stopped working, she almost died. Thankfully she was in a country with stellar healthcare who saved her life, but she found it she has Crohn’s disease, and she had to get a colostomy bag. While she was recovering from her surgery, Douche announced he wanted to divorce. His words were, and I quote, “I didn’t marry a sick woman.” Fucking prick. 

He left her high and dry, and very soon was seeing someone else. He lost all the friends he had made in our country with his awful behaviour, my family told him he was no longer welcome near us as we were there for Heidi. He finally fecked off back to Israel, apparently he had got into quite a bit of debt while in my country, and skipped off to avoid paying. Good riddance we all said. 

Heidi found her feet eventually. She took up photography, and went to university to study it. She did very well for herself, and lived a happy life free from Douche. After about a year, Douche contacted Heidi and she told us all about it. Apparently he was trying to sweet talk her into going over to Israel to go through with the divorce proceedings. According to Heidi, your marital status is on your identity card in Israel, and it’s one of the first things a girl asks to see when you go on a date. When the girls saw he was married on his card, they’d never go for a second date. 

So every time he’d call her asking when she was coming over, she’d put a huge shit eating grin on  and reply, “Ohhh, I don’t know, I’m not really in a position to fly with my condition and all. Maybe when I get better.” She knew full well he won’t set foot back here because his creditors were still looking for their money back. She would just relish in the knowledge that he was getting rejected by all those women he was pursuing in Israel while she chilled with us having a great time. 

Heidi is doing much better now, she went back to Germany, though still visits my family and her friends from time to time. She’s still her awesome self. 

I don’t know what Douche is up to now, but I suspect after all these years he is still a douche. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8edl9q/divorce_me_while_i_am_sick_thats_fine_enjoy_being/,pettyrevenge,445,1.0

I’m the youngest of five children, and after watching four siblings get a party after they graduate, I decided I wanted one too, but I didn’t want some crazy rager. I just wanted maybe ten or fifteen kids I was close friends with and I made sure that everyone I invited was personally invited so that I knew everyone there would be respectful of my parents house. Well, we all know how easy it is for one douchebag to catch wind of these things and invite themselves. In my case it was, let’s call him Douche. 

Douche is that one kid who has to be a troll about everything in life. He has no real friends. He’s that person that gets introduced as the “asshole friend”. 

The party was fun, no one got hurt, and the cops never got called(this was out in the country of California, so you could get away with drinking as a teenager as long as the popo didn’t get called). 

The next day, I came outside and looked at my moms pool where a lot of people were hanging out in the night before, and the pool was chocked full of cigarette butts. All Marlboro red butts. It was disgusting. I swept them all out with a net, and even had to jump in later to pick up some trash off the bottom. My parents worked really hard to have this pool, and now it looked like trash. 

I spoke to a few of my friends who said Douche told them all it was one of our other friends who threw all of the butts into the pool. I believed Douche, because the other friend was also a smoker, and he was there all night by the pool, and he was pretty drunk too. But since no one actually saw them do it, I never knew for sure. I let it go, simply because they were drunk 18 year olds being stupid, but I was still mad my friend had disrespected my house like that. And since we were all graduated, it wasn’t like I could see these people at school on Monday to ask what happened. 

I am 28 now, and I still talk to a few people I went to high school with, including the friend who got the blame for the butts. During a random phone chat, my party got brought up, and I told him I still never gave him any shit for all of the cigarettes he threw into my mom’s pool. He got really defensive and said he would NEVER do something like that, and that it was actually Douche who sat by the pool all night and threw his cigarettes in because he didn’t know anyone there and he “didn’t give a fuck” who’s house or pool it was. 

The revenge: my brother is in an electricians union as a journeyman, and he called me to tell me he got a new apprentice who graduated the same year as me. Guess who it is!!! Yup, it’s DOUCHE! 

So I told my brother everything he had done, and now every time my brother needs grunt work done, guess who gets put on shit detail? You guessed it. Douche. He calls me every other week to tell me all the ways he made his life hell at work. 

TL;DR douche throws entire pack of cigarette butts into my mom’s pool at a graduation party, so my brother made him work extra hard at his job ten years later. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8e5581/if_youre_gonna_smoke_an_entire_pack_of_cigarettes/,pettyrevenge,134,0.0
2018-04-21 17:53:20+00:00,5300,Stop screaming at your Xbox,skeazy,"In 2012, I was in the military and they had these pretty sweet apartments we could live in on base. It was significantly better than the barracks, full kitchen, living room, private bedroom and bathroom, with two bedrooms to an apartment. Each person had their own internet connection  with their own router and such. 


I didn't know the guy in the other room very well, we were on opposite shifts and we both tended to just stay in our bedrooms if we were there.

He loved playing Call of Duty. He was the stereotypical guy that talks shit and screams the whole time he's playing. Not yells. Screams. Like shrieks. You could tell when he was doing really well because he would scream even more. He did it constantly and I had asked him to keep it down a few times but he continued.

One of the few times we actually hung out, he had a couple of friends over from his ship. One of his friends would often crash on our couch on weekends. He mentioned his laptop had been running really slowly and I offered to look at it for him. He agreed and I told him I would see what I can find and he could just grab it Sunday night.


Remember how I said we had our own internet connections? Of course his friend was logged into his Wi-Fi. So I just checked the handy 'show password' box on his connection settings and saved it on my own laptop.


From that point on, any time I heard him start yelling, I would wait until he was screaming about racking up kill streaks, log into his router admin page, and disconnect his Xbox.

It was the same every time. Screaming followed by a few moments of blissful silence, and then ""GOD DAMNIT"" would erupt from his room.

I share the communal toilet / shower in my hostel with all the other girls who live on my floor. Last night, I came back to my room after a long and tiring day and just wanted a hot and relaxing shower before I turned in for the night. The thing is, hot water is supposed to be available in every shower cubicle in the hostel toilets but for some reason the one I have on my floor only has one cubicle with running hot water. When I went into the toilet I saw that the particular cubicle was taken and usually on any other day I would have just used one of the others but last night I just really wanted my hot shower. I decided to return to my room to wait for the cubicle to be available and went back 30 minutes later (quite a reasonable time for a shower right?) to find that the cubicle was still occupied. Whoever was inside didn't have the water running unlike half an hour ago and was blasting music / singing. I thought that meant she was almost done and went to fetch my stuff, only to find the water running AGAIN when I came back 5 minutes later. This time I knocked on the door and asked if she was going to be done soon because I've been waiting for awhile and would like to use the shower as well. Girl inside said, ""yeah just let me put on my clothes"". I spent the next 15 minutes waiting for the sound of running water to cease but it never happened. I got really annoyed at this point in time, decided to switch the water heater off, and left the toilet with the door closed so that no one would be able to hear her from outside if she did ask for help with the heater (this was pretty late at night and traffic was sparse). Thereafter I hid in a corner that the toilet was visible from and felt extremely satisfied when I saw a neighbour I didn't like very much come out of the toilet, scowling and shivering.

So imagine the people sitting in the next row of cubes suddenly work for a different company. Fortunately we had all worked together for years so it wasn't that bad, until my company was bought and we had to move out.

The move was nearly complete, we were just wheeling everybody's chairs to the moving truck when strangely one of our former co-workers decided that the chairs were like the desks and should stay with the office. We argued for awhile but he wouldn't budge. One of my coworkers tried too, meanwhile I literally stole my chair and put it in my car. I really liked that chair.

In the end we gave up, he wasn't going to let us keep our chairs. We hopped followed the moving truck to the new office. On the way my boss called to see what was taking so long. We explained, he got pissed and sent us on one last mission.

When the division was spun off the main company retained ownership of all networking hardware. We worked together to divide the network into two separate parts using the same hardware. When we started the move we agreed to leave the switches behind since we wouldn't need them in the new office anyway.

A woman where I used to work was (and still is) one of the most self-centered people I've ever met. Everything was about her, and she filled every work day with stories about her clothes, her figure, who was flirting with her, etc. etc. It became hurtful for me, because she clearly tried to ""one-up"" about dating &amp; I'd gone through a tough breakup. Then it began hurting others...

""Harry,"" the brother-in-law of another coworker (""Kay"") had met her and tried to date her, and Miss Narcissist was simply stringing him along for the ego trip of bragging about his phone calls, etc. She wouldn't tell him she wasn't interested, because then she wouldn't get the attention from him, or from telling us her stories. 

Well, ""Kay"" had a party &amp; we were all invited, but Miss N couldn't attend, even though the would-be suitor was there. So we cooked up a plan, and our entire small work team was in on it, including a male coworker. The next Monday, we began the following, very loud conversation over our cubicle walls:

Male Coworker: ""Hey, Word2daWise, Harry sure seemed interested in you at the party. Are you two gonna get together?"" 

Me: ""I don't know - I just met him...""

Male Coworker: ""I think he wants to go out with you.""

Kay: ""He asked about you after you left, so don't be surprised if you hear from him!"" 

Me: ""We'll see - he seems nice &amp; he's fun to be around."" (I was deliberately sounding iffy)

*(Phone rings in Miss Narcissist cubicle, and it's ""Harry,"" who asked the following pre-scripted question:)*  

Harry: ""Hey, what can you tell me about Word? Do you think she'd go out with me?"" 

Miss Narcissist (very stiffly): ""I really don't know. You'll have to ask her."" The conversation ends quickly.

(By this time, we are all in pain, trying to avoid laughing out loud.)

*(Phone rings again, in my cubicle)*

Me: (loudly) ""Hey - it's good to hear from you!"" then, a bunch of quiet mumbling, where nobody could hear the words, punctuated with some laughter on my part. 

She never asked about the conversation, and never again brought up his name. And, the best part, he got revenge for the way she was treating him &amp; we all got revenge for the endless, boring, self-centered crap she subjected us to. 

Here's a special punchline - I didn't even attend the party. but we knew of each other and we were ALL fed up with Miss Narcissist's behavior.

This isn’t the first time they’ve “forgotten” to invite me, they have their clique and that’s their decision not to include me, my hobbies are fairly different and I don’t like drinking at lunch time.

2018-04-12 12:01:00+00:00,2601,Steal my seat? Enjoy taking photos of the back of my head.,gohkamikaze,"I'm currently on a backpacking trip around Europe, and I've been hanging out in London the past week and a half. I know I can't really complain about 'tourists' because, well, I AM one, but I at least try to be considerate. I don't push in, I always use my manners, I'm mindful of others trying to take photos and displays, and so on.

But unfortunately I've found that a lot of others don't seem to extend the same courtesy. It's fine, I'm usually pretty annoyed when someone shoves me out of the way or stands in front of me when I have my camera out, but there's bigger problems out there to get worked up over.

Today though, something happened that really rubbed me up the wrong way. I'd just hopped on a tour boat up the Thames - I'd been waiting patiently in line about 30 minutes because I wanted to grab a decent seat, and as luck would have it I managed to snag a premium spot on the upper deck of the boat, right next to the railing - fantastic for photos.

Here's where things get shitty: the tour guide pointed out out a particularly interesting site on the opposite side of the boat, so I quickly jumped up in the isle to take some photos. No less than 10 seconds later, two girls push past me and - much to my disgust - take my seat and the seat adjacent to it, ruining my view.

As mentioned before, normally I'd just sigh and let it go, but after spending several days being just generally pushed around and mildly irritated by other disrespectful tourists I was feeling particularly vindictive. I sat back down in the same row - now towards the isle - and began plotting my revenge.

Fortunately, I didn't have to wait long. One of the next stops was Tower Bridge, and the guide mentioned that we would be swinging the boat around so that we could get some nice shots on the right hand side (we were seated on the left). Just in my peripheral, I saw them take out their phones in preparation for photos, and as we began to turn I put my plan into action.

Using all my knowledge and pent up frustration acquired over the last few days, I stood up very obnoxiously, blocked the row (and therefore their view), and began taking photos.

In walks this young, slick, LOUD business kid (early 20’s?) on a conference call, shouting into his Apple ear buds.

Continues pacing and shouting, “Yup, yup, we’ll upload that into the system .... blah blah jargon jargon acronyms and business bullshit” annoying everybody around, making everyone else get out of his way. Folks start giving him the stink eye but his shouting and pacing continue, his circuit widening until he’s walking out of sight, then circling back, still shouting into the air. 

After 20 minutes of this, I’m over it. Kid stalks off in a hurried pace, abandoning his backpack for the three or so minutes it takes him to pace the terminal. 

So I walk up to a TSA guard and point to the bag “Sir, there’s an unclaimed backpack on that seat!” Then I walk away.

2018-04-11 10:34:17+00:00,2460,Unintentional revenge: A car accident I profited from!,SpookyKat0512,"

I was hit backing out of a parking spot in a parking lot by a woman in an SUV. She had driven past me and pulled into a parking spot behind me, so I started backing out. She slammed her car in reverse and backed into me. A spot a little closer was open and she missed it at first. It left a basketball sized dent over my rear drivers side tire. She was on her phone the entire time.

She nonchalantly pulled into the closer spot and got out of her car. She started to walk past me like nothing happened. I get out of my car and ask her if she didn’t see me or what? She says I hit her, and proceeded to walk into the store to shop. 

I got her license plate number and vehicle description and left. I had never been in an accident before, so I didn’t realize I should have called the police. I thought since it happened on private property, I didn’t need to. I reported it to my insurance company and they sent an adjuster out, etc. 

She told her insurance company I drove off from the scene and wouldn’t talk to her or exchange information. She couldn’t describe me or my car. 
Her car had no damage.

Long story short, they determined I was telling the truth and sent me a check minus my deductible. I got my car fixed and figured that was the end of it. 

I got a call from my insurance company wanting to go over my side of the story again because they had some discrepancies with her story. They were trying to get their money back from her insurance company because the claims adjuster said after inspecting both cars, the accident was absolutely her fault. She told them the back of my car hit the passenger side of her car, but she had no damage whatsoever. I found out later that they weren’t sure who she was because the vehicle was in a mans name and she wasn’t listed as a driver, so they needed a detailed description. Luckily, I had written it all down before I “left the scene”. They needed to record me for litigation purposes. 

About 3 months later, I get a call from the same lady at my insurance company informing me I was getting my entire deductible back. Her insurance company decided after 15 minutes to reimburse my insurance company the total amount because this lady’s car and insurance were in her sons name. She was the original client with the company and added her son on the account, then was dropped (by the company) along the way making her son their sole client. Her license was revoked 2 years prior because of the amount of tickets (mostly from accidents) she had accrued over the years. I have only had 1 ticket in my entire driving history and no accidents. My ticket was 16 years prior to this incident.  

I received the check for my deductible a few weeks later. They told me that was the quickest resolution to an accident they had ever seen.

The son was charged the full amount of the accident plus litigation for allowing his mother to drive a car in his name with his insurance. His insurance company dropped him. The lady told me he may be charged with something to the effect of allowing her to drive a car in his name knowing she had a revoked license. I don’t know how true this part is, but that’s what I was told. Either way, his insurance premiums were going to skyrocket because of this accident.
 
I actually ended up making $130 off of this, because the shop I had my car repaired at charged me less than the claims adjuster figured the repairs would be! 

I guess the moral to this is, if your mother can’t stay off her cell phone while she’s driving, don’t assume responsibility with her vehicle and insurance!

My one friend (lets call him Jeff) gets absolutely plastered on our last night there. Starts causing a scene and breaking stuff in our suite, so our priority was to get him the fuck out of there. 

We finally manage to get him off to a bar with our other friend ""Nick"" to supervise him, while we sorted out our room. We get to bed around midnight and all was fine up until 6am.

Jeff and Nick come through the door both yelling, along with two other female voices. The yelling and giggling went on for 15 minutes until one of us got up to ask them to be quiet. It continued still. finally at 6:40 I turn to my buddy ""Joe"" and say ""Fuck this, if I'm not gonna get back to sleep, I'm gonna go down there and cock-block them.""

I get dressed and go downstairs, put on a pot of coffee, slice and eat an avocado (yes I'm really fucking white), meanwhile Jeff is still trying to maintain what he had going with the two women. It took about 15 minutes of me awkwardly standing there eating my 'cado and drinking my caf before they decided they needed to leave. 

Mission successful. But way more successful than i could've imagined.

Turns out the two women were both prostitutes that Jeff and Nick ordered from the next city an hour away. That cost them $1200 CDN, and Jeff still wanted to get laid, so he called them back. He ended up paying an extra $600 for that plus the cost of another hotel room to do the deed in.

That's a success if I ever saw one.

This time, the entire fucking bottle is gone. WTF.

I cannot afford to replace it on your whim to thieve it. You are literally stealing food from the mouths of my  kids. I will be very happy if it is returned. Thank you"" then I take two toddlers on a trip to the store that is exaughsting AF to get more. 

I don't make the same mistake again. For a few months. Then I do, I find my bottle literally bone dry of detergent. This has cost me much distress and at least 30$ at this point, 30 dollars I literally cannot afford. I'm furious. 

I go to the dollar store and cop some lavender scented bleach. Luckily I now have an empty bottle of the Eco friendly paraben free lightly scented lavander bullshit, from the last theft. 
I fill it with bleach. I leave it. They take it. 
I feel like a horrible person. I look to see which of my 25 neighbors is covered in bleach spots. No one reveals themselves. Months later, I forget my bottle in the laundry room a couple times when I am running back and forth, cooking inbetween loads etc. No one takes a drop! 

I am so sorry I damaged your clothes. Whomever you are. BUT, you deserved that shit - and you know it.

I bought myself shampoo and body wash because I had recently ran out of them within a couple weeks which I thought was weird but I didn't really think much of it. I asked my housemates if anyone had used my shower products and nobody said they did. However, this is where I realized I wasn't the only one using my products. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and I'm running low again. I was keeping an eye on my products and I realized that it was going quick again. The other bottles that were my housemates had been bone dry for a week (I live with 5 other people and there were 3 or 4 empty body washes and shampoos). I knew that someone was using them but I didn't know who. So in my act of petty revenge, I took my bottles, which were on it's last leg, and I added some white vinegar and mixed it around. 

On a side note, vinegar is actually good for your skin and hair.

My plan was to add the vinegar and wait to see who came out smelling like it. Later that day, three of my housemates came out of the shower smelling like vinegar and they didn't say anything. Actually, the whole bathroom smelled like vinegar and one of my other housemates who uses the shower across the hall had pointed it out. I knew exactly who they were and I called them out on it.

Flew CheapAss Airlines from Los Angeles because my friend wanted to save $400 and had never traveled outside Murica. Cool, let's spend money on bad decisions later. Well you get what you pay for, and I'm behind RudeAss Passenger. RudeAss thinks it's a great idea to  wrap her all white jacket around her seat so it looks like my food tray has a snow tent around it and bread and orange juice are huddled campers. My mashed potatoes looked like a snowman at Mammoth Mountain. 

I tapped her shoulder to indicate her insult to the airline deities, she looked back at me, at her jacket, said something in Chinese, and sat back down. I'm Asian but not Chinese, no idea what she said, but she left her jacket to shelter my food. I've lost my appetite. 

I sat there pondering how millions of Chinese are out of poverty and exploring the planet but haven't had decades to learn airline etiquette, and how I miss snowboarding and that her jacket is perfect for the mountains, and I thought of this channel...and that my snowman and campers should stay on the mountain. 

So I melted the butter on the still warm bread and slipped it in her jacket pocket, front side. Mr. Frosty potatoes went in the inner pocket. Dessert was some kind of white gelatin, perfect camouflage, went to other inner pocket. Bread crumbs in the final pocket. I put just enough in each pocket thinking that she won't know til later. 

I buttoned up her jacket so she'd have to go back to my seat to undo it. I asked for a different seats near the front so we'd get out of the plane before her. 

Later I saw her going through customs. She hadn't noticed yet, but I saw she put her passport in the heavily buttered pocket for easy retrieval. I didn't see what happened after. 

May the airline gods forgive her trespass, because I didn't.

2018-04-07 16:17:13+00:00,3041,Don't be assholes when camping.,bloodscourge,"LTL... yadda yadda  tl;dr at the end

My wife and I are going camping at Havasupai Falls next month and we've been getting her ready to carry a ruck for the full 12 mile in and out hike. We bought some new sleeping pads and wanted to try them out with our hammocks, so we went for a camping trip to Lost Maples state natural area. 

First we hiked to the primitive camping area to hang our hammocks to save a good spot we liked. Then we went for a full 13 mile hike around the park with 4k cumulative elevation change. It was a beautiful day, and the hike was quite a bit of fun. We finished the loop back at the trailhead and decided to fill up our hydration packs at the water fountains, when they arrived. 

About 30 college kids in a rental people mover, and a truck with a giant trailer with everyones gear. They were already a lively bunch, an hoping for the best, we got back on the trail to go cook some food and relax. Mind you, we weren't the only people there. There were also a couple families already at the primitive site as well after we setup our stuff. A couple hours later... they arrive.

We first heard them while they were all hiking on the trail. Once they arrive, they setup their spots about 75 yards from us and begin their night. Loud and boisterous, kids. No big deal. It gets late so we bed down but the noise continues. Not camping noise, but people just being louts. 

Yelling for no reason, throwing things around. A dude and a girl walking to the compost toilet while he was explaining to her his previous sexual exploits (because, chivalry). They ended up breaking into two sects. Main camp, and then a group of like 6-7 who went go smoke weed by the compost toilet. Why? No clue. 11:30 pm rolls around, and while laying in my hammock I literally yell at them to kindly, shut the fuck up. People are trying to sleep. 

They all go quiet. They build up noise after a bit but at least hike away from us. We can still easily hear them because it's a canyon so it just funnels noise. At about 3am, they are all tired and inebriated enough to pack it in. And so the pettiness begins!

At about 6:30am we wakeup and pack up camp. We notice all the other families are also awake; the college group is not. My wife mentions she's thinking about being loud, I told her I plan on it. Not only do I make sure all of my cookware is constantly bang around to move over and over again, I just can't contain my emotions on the scenery. I just have to exclaim how good I'm feeling. THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT TRIP, WASN'T IT BABE? Amongst other things. All the while looking over at the group, watching them get up, look around, then try to lay down and get more sleep. 

On our walk out past their camp ""IT'S A GREAT DAY TO GO HIKING. YYEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  WHO WOULD WANT TO SLEEP IN ON A DAY LIKE THIS?"" My wife also trying to yell, but also trying not to laugh too hard at me. Not a one of them was still asleep when we walked by, and it looks like we kick-started their hangover headaches.

I worked my way up, the rest of the managers were mostly brought in. I would work my butt off to help them. I’d clean tables, comp tickets even when it’s my lunch, refill drinks if they were in the weeds, etc. We’re in this together, these are my people.

I was getting married, majority of my guests and bridesmaids are my co-workers. I got my dress at  rhymes with Mavid’s Bridal. My mom wasn’t there for the dress shopping, she lived 5 states away. That weekend we were going back for the fitting and I was super excited to show my mom my wedding dress and veil. 

Lady comes in to pick up her Togo order. Chicken fingers and fries. They had just been made piping hot, no problems or exceptions to the order. She’s wearing a branded Bridal polo. 

She comes back two minutes later, claims the order is cold, we used old fries etc. I watched them make the order, she must have opened the box in the car, there’s no way it’s cold. But okay, we’ll make you another. I get the kitchen to drop the new tenders and fries. The General Manager goes to comp the meal. We always go over the top for customer service. 

Lady then claims the Togo girl was rude to her. I was there. She didn’t do anything out of turn, she doesn’t care too much about fighting over chicken fingers. She said “Okay, let me get a manager, we’re so sorry.”

Somehow in the 8 minutes to turn the order around, lady is even more upset. Manager tries to give her a card for another free chicken finger meal next time she comes in. Order comes up. We give the new hot order to the now yelling lady. She’s mad because the Togo girl wasn’t punished enough in front of her. I guess the GM was supposed to humiliate my friend in front of everyone?

He said he’ll take care of the discipline problem. (He won’t) but he apologizes again. She opens her bag of food, opens the box and hurls it. The sauce spills all over my friend’s shirt and she has hot fries and chicken fingers thrown in her face. The lady stomps out.

I ask my boss to make a call after we all share the “holy shit, she’s crazy.” He’s confused, I’ve never asked to use my cell on the floor, but he goes along with it.

I call Mavid’s Bridal and tell them I was a guest at a restaurant and their employee just dumped food and yelled obscenities while in uniform representing their company. Furthermore, I was a bride coming in for a fitting this weekend. I describe the lady and say I don’t want her anywhere near my appointment, on top of being crazy unprofessional, I have people coming in from out of town, it’s a special time for me. I don’t want her vibe to ruin it. Manager there promises she won’t be and is appalled.

I’ve never called anyone else out for bad behavior while in uniform. But my GM thought this was awesome. And I was totally rocking a petty revenge lady boner. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8aat1l/throw_food_at_my_coworker_in_uniform_ill_call/,pettyrevenge,142,0.0

There's no camera in our work kitchen so there's no definitive proof of him doing it, but a day after the suspected date of the incident my manager approached him about it. During this confrontation he stated that *he* had bought the coffee for everyone at work, and used this as justification for putting the fiber supplement into the entire container since it would be technically his.

2018-04-04 22:25:50+00:00,8801,When an Uber driver refuses to return your stuff,JudgeJudy1979,"First of all, I understand leaving something behind in an Uber is a pain in the ass for the driver. Uber has recently added a $15 fee for a driver returning an item which I completely support and in the past, I’ve given a driver a $20 tip for returning my item. Now to my story- 

Late Friday night I left both my phone and wallet in an Uber on my way home from a party. I thought they might have been left at the party, so I waited until Saturday morning to check before reaching out to the Uber driver. My phone is off so no luck with find my iPhone, which is strange because I went out with a full charge. My friend is unable to find it at his place to I reach out to the driver. 

I try him a few times throughout the day and I either get his voicemail or he answers and immediately hangs up. I understand they work weird hours so no alarms yet. Finally, I get through and he confirms he has the phone, but says he can’t meet today. When I ask when he can meet, he starts to pretend he can’t hear me and just says “hello? Hello?” Before hanging up. 

I try him the rest of Saturday and Sunday, getting the same voicemail/hang up runaround. I reach out to Uber, who reaches out to him directly asking about my items. Monday morning Uber tells me he doesn’t have them, and despite me telling them that he confirmed that he did on Saturday, they were about as helpful as you’d expect.

I get ahold of the driver Monday afternoon after repeated attempts, which is only the second time I’ve ever spoken to him at this point. His story is now that he doesn’t have them, and when I say I’m going to get the cops involved he hesitates for a second but then doubles down and says he can prove he doesn’t have them (?). 

I file the police report and then as a last ditch effort, decide to take the number I got from his answering machine (Uber connects you via phone rather than giving you their number) and text him, offering $200 for my items returned, no questions asked. 

Well guys, as luck would have it, he found my phone and wallet! My offer must have made them magically appear out of thin air! I grab $200 from the bank and we arrange a meeting time, which he repeatedly moves. I’m having to do this all without a phone, so shout out to my lovely wife for coordinating this all. He’s apparently very excited during this call, and is asking how his “reward” will be paid. 

I wait in the rain for an hour for this guy, in a see of downtown Chicago Uber’s. Finally I spot his car, confirm it’s him, and jump into the front seat. I pull out the money and ask to see my stuff, which he pulls out of his center console and places near me. I start counting out the money on my lap, and once I reach $200 I pick it up, take my wallet and phone and say “here you go!” Without actually handing it to him to him.

I book it out the car and don’t look back. I go the opposite way he’s facing so that he can’t follow me, and make my way to a pedestrian only courtyard. 

Surprise surprise, my phone is turned off with plenty of battery left, which means he turned it off so I couldn’t find it. 

I feel for Uber drivers who have to deal with customers leaving stuff behind, but I would have happily have worked with him to make it as convenient as possible to return my things. Refusing to coordinate and then lying about having things that you find is theft, and it felt great to pull a fast one on this asshole.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/89u7zp/when_an_uber_driver_refuses_to_return_your_stuff/,pettyrevenge,437,0.0

I asked if there is a way resolve the situation right away. Because my spot was taken and I wasn't able to park anywhere else (visitor parks full), security wrote me a permission slip to park *behind* my spot, over the weekend.

Towing would occur only after 5 tickets. We are a bit frustrated, but we agreed to leave the situation as it is. 

Then, the owner of the other car showed up, right when we were about to leave. I was a bit relieved that I can get my spot back right away, put all this behind me and this moron would get a parking ticket for my 20 minute inconvenience.

Other driver was really angry for the parking ticket, as he saw it as a ""free spot"", regardless of the signs saying 

* ""private area"", 

* ""parking for residents only"", 

* ""visitor parking *that* way --&gt;"" 

* ""all miss-parked vehicles will be fined/towed"" etc, etc. 

and the spot has heating/electricity pole for engine/indoor heater with apartment number. 

His explanation still was: ""There was no car parked on the spot, so it *was* free."" He repeated this maybe 10 times with constantly increasing volume. Security and parking enforcement explained to him that it was indeed vacant, but reserved, thus not available for him to park.

Then he targeted me with his anger, for causing him to be blocked in and started to shout at me that he was in hurry and that I'm an asshole and I should pay his parking ticket and what else, demanding me to move. Then he proceeded to kick my front tire to highlight his point, causing some snow to fall from my mud-flap-things. There was no damage, but out of principle this pissed me off, a lot.

I explained to him that he can just go home to his mom to learn some manners, I wouldn't be moving until Monday morning and he can walk around to cool off meanwhile. Security and parking explained too that as *I was legally parked* and not obstructing any of the *residents* nor permitted vehicles, there was nothing *more* they could do, except keep ticketing this car without residence parking permission, until he gets towed.

So I left him there fuming in anger. As I was walking off towards my building, I could hear him shouting (not very sincere) apologies, but it was too late for him. I had already made a petty decision to stand my ground. The cars stays there for entire weekend as far as I care, I'm not going anywhere and I'm not going to move to help this rude imbecile.

Weekend passes without further incidents and my GF uses my car for shopping and stuff, but the other car owner is nowhere to be seen... At Monday morning when leaving to work, at 7am, I see a tow truck idling near my car, so I got worried that I'm being towed, regardless of my permission to park there. It had been snowing for all weekend and my ""temporary mis-parking permission"" was not visible anymore through the windshield. 

Luckily, they weren't there for me. After finishing scraping windows and clearing the snow off, I hopped in and took off. The tow truck guys gave me thumbs up and moved to where I just left, to tow the other car out of my spot. Probably security (knowing I always leave around 7am) had advised the tow crew of the situation.

When I got home again, my spot was free again. 

(I felt glad that I was able to help someone with no spot of his own, to store his car over the weekend **and** forcing possible thieves to steal my car *before* his car could be stolen. So I'm 100% good guy and this compensates for my pettiness. /s)

Well one day I'm walking home from school minding my own business when a group of guys from my grade  (about 4 or 5 of them) ride their bikes past me. These guys were the popular preppy kids and were pretty obnoxious.  They ride their bikes past me yelling things like what a loser I am and just making me feel like shit. 


So I go home and cried a little,  but then I remembered that our school had a student directory with students phone number, address, and the parents name. So I called 2 of the boys' mother   (the other ones were not in the phone book) pretending to be my older sister and let them know what the boys said and how it made me cry. Both mothers were furious and apologized for their behavior. I felt pretty  good that they would get in trouble. I thought it was over BUT IT WASN'T.  


While my family is eating dinner we get a knock on the door. My mom opens it and calls me shortly after. I go to the front door and there I see T (the main one calling me names) with his mom and he is crying. His mom forces him to apologize and promise that he will never do it again. I guess the phone book works both ways and that's probably how they found my address. Thinking about it now it was petty,  but boy did that feel good back then!

This happened a LONG time ago, when my family was at a friend's house for a barbecue. There were a bunch of other kids there, so we decided to play capture-the-flag (the flags were tennis balls because we didn't have real flags.) We divided the teams up as boys vs. girls (I'm on the girls team). At first there was some argument over the division of teams, because there were 5 girls and 6 boys, but we decided that the 2 youngest boys were roughly equal to 1 teenage boy (this is important later). We start playing, and after a while one of the girls gets tired and quits. It's decided that one of the boys will join the girls team to even it up. This boy is my younger brother, we'll call him Joe. (not his real name, obviously). Now each team had 5 people. First round with the new teams goes fine, then we move to the second round. We hide our tennis ball, then leave Joe to guard it while the rest of the team goes in search of the other team's tennis ball.  

That was our mistake.  

I should mention that the house was off-limits to players, and tennis balls could not be hidden inside. We hid ours in one of those plastic clubhouses that our friends had. Then we set off to find the boys team tennis ball. What next happened was the impetus for my petty revenge.  The 2 youngest of the boys team-the ones who we decided were equal to 1 teenager-entered the house to use the bathroom. While they were inside, Joe signaled for them to come over (he was near the glass door which led to the backyard) and showed them where we had hidden our tennis ball. Now, they couldn't do anything officially at the moment, so they finished up, headed back to their team, and led them straight to the tennis ball. Joe did nothing to prevent them, and they got the ball. We came back to find that we had been defeated. The other girls were disappointed, but I was suspicious. We had rolled this ball in mud, and then hidden it INSIDE of a clubhouse which was brown, and in accordance with the game rules, we had left a tiny part of it visible, but the mud we had rolled it in made it almost unnoticeable. So it should come as no surprise that I smelled bullcrap.  

I talked to the the youngest boys, one of whom was my youngest brother, Fred. (again, not his real name). After a bit of coaxing and pointed questions, he spilled the beans: Joe had showed them where the ball was hidden, and had not prevented them from getting it.

  This is where the revenge starts. I was furious. I stormed off and told the other girls, who were just as mad. We knew we could not let this go unpunished, but we couldn't use violence, because our parents were all there. Then I had an idea.  

I had baked brownies, and brought them to the party with us. I was famous for my baking, and I knew that if I presented them to the boys, they wouldn't be able to resist. So, with the help of the girl who lived in the house, we raided the spice cabinet and found our weapon of choice: garlic. We cut the brownies in half layer cake style, and sprinkled garlic in between the 2 layers. We then put them back together, set them on a plate, and descended into the basement.  

It was decided that I would present the brownies to them, because I was the baker, the leader of the girls team, and the oldest. I gave them to the boys as a ""peace offering,"" to show that there were no hard feelings, and that we were willing to let it go. The boys, suspecting no foul play, eagerly dug into the brownies. I watched with an evil grin on my face as one by one, their faces turned from delight to disgust and horror. Spitting them out, Joe turns to me and says, ""What did you DO?""  

""Garlic."" I replied simply.  

""Why???""  

""Next time, don't cheat.""  

They tried to rat us out, and got told that they shouldn't have cheated, and that they got what they deserved. Justice-and their ""just desserts""- were served, and never tasted so good.  

tl;dr? My brothers cheated during capture the flag, so the girls fed them brownies laced with garlic.

2018-03-31 13:24:16+00:00,5152,When the popular bully ends up alone,you-know-poo,"First time posting here and on mobile blah blah blah

So, this happened a few years ago, when I was in high school. My high school had a huge problem with cliques, which was honestly made worse by the administration. The school worshipped the ground the football players and cheerleaders walked on, and they could do no wrong. 

Most of the football players were pretty chill, but the cheerleaders... they were something else. These girls liked to torment and bully anyone they deemed not worthy, and they were led by “Sally.” I was their favorite target, because I was new to the school and quiet. 

Sally was dating the quarterback, “Gary.” Gary and I had a math class together, and he was actually a really cool guy. I’m not sure if he didn’t know about Sally’s bullying, or if he just didn’t know how bad it was, but it was never mentioned... until one day. 

I was on my way to math class when Sally and her friends cornered me, and proceeded to say really terrible things about me, none of which were true. They said they were going to tell everyone that I had sex in the library with 5 football players, and that everyone would think I was a slut. 

Honestly, what they said didn’t bug me much, because my small group of friends wouldn’t believe them, anyway. But I was pissed and wanted revenge. So I went to the bathroom, made my eyes wet and red, and walked into math class looking quite distraught. Nice guy Gary was immediately concerned, and when he asked me what had happened, all I said was “ask your girlfriend.”

I later saw Sally and Gary arguing in the hallway. It turns out, he broke up with her over the situation. Once she was no longer dating the quarterback, the other cheerleaders stopped following her lead. I guess she had been belittling them, too. Sally lost her boyfriend, her friends, and all of the respect/fear anyone had had for her. Oh, and those rumors never got spread about me. The bullying stopped completely after that, in fact. 

TL;DR - Girl thinks she can bully people because she’s dating the quarterback. I tell quarterback about the bullying and she loses everything. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/88ilgz/when_the_popular_bully_ends_up_alone/,pettyrevenge,167,0.0
2018-03-29 17:10:35+00:00,4052,Take all of the office treats for yourself? I'll mildly inconvenience you all day.,MsUndeadBus,"I work in a very small office (12 people at the whole company). 

On Monday, I had some extra chocolate-covered pretzels that I had made for a party. Right after lunch, I put them out on a plate in the break room to share, then went back to my desk. My desk is right next to the break room, but I can't see directly into the room from my seat.

Probably ~1 minute after I sat back down, co-worker ""Dale"" comes in from outside, through the back door. (The back door is also near my desk and the break room, so I can kinda see them both). Dale walks into the break room, then leaves to go to his desk. 

I was curious to see if he took any pretzels, so I poked my head back in to the break room. There were TWO chocolate pretzels left out of the ~30 I had set out. The motherfucker took practically all of them!!! 

I was kinda bummed, since I was excited to share the snacks with everyone. Greedy Dale took that away from me, and he didn't think anyone would notice...

Here's how I enacted my petty revenge the next day:

Dale always parks right next to the back door, because he often leaves throughout the day to do deliveries and courier-type things for the office. The back door auto-locks, but you can unlock it from the inside before you leave to disable the auto lock. So it's locked overnight, but Dale usually leaves it unlocked throughout the day so he can go in and out.

That next day, I had some work to do that did not require me to be at my desk all day -- I was around different parts of the office. However, I took notice of every time Dale would leave. Three times on Tuesday, I locked the door behind him and closed the vestibule door so no one would hear if he knocked. Every single time, he had to walk around the whole building to the front door. I was never suspected. He couldn't even blame me for not answering his knocks since I wasn't at my desk. &gt;:}

I had a big camping trailer that I would sometimes park on the street in front of my house when we were preparing to go camping or when we just got back late the night before. I would park it as far from the mailbox as possible, but also had to not park too far back because of the neighbor’s driveway. There was still room for the mailman to get to the mailbox, but it was more difficult with his Jeep. 

Every once in a while, we would get complaints from the mailman. Sometimes all he had to do was pull forward and then back up slightly to reach the mailbox from his vehicle. Since we were the only house with a mailbox on the side of the street, I thought it was quite rude of him to keep complaining. All of the other houses had mailboxes at their door, including the neighbors on both sides of me. He delivered their mail by walking down the street every time. Why did he have to complain about getting out or backing up his Jeep for me?

I then realized a solution. I went to the hardware store and bought a really nice mailbox for next to my door and pulled out the old post and mailbox by the street. Wow. My yard looked way better now without that old mailbox and I never heard another complaint from the mailman.

At my job, I work with about a thirty people, all in a room of cubicles.  It's a small office, so if you are talking to your cubicle neighbor, there's a good chance Jane and Bob on the other side, can hear your entire conversation.

Most days everyone is cordial and keep their talking volume low.  Most of us wear headphones to blank out the monotony of data entry.

One woman in the middle of the office, thinks she is the next Whitney, or maybe Reba, possibly a Christina, whatever it is, she thinks everyone appreciates her random singing (or worse, off-key humming).  She's been asked to lower her voice, be aware of the people around her, and told to keep quiet, especially if I can hear you over my noise cancelling headphones.  She's been reported to the boss, yet we still are subjected to a daily concert of tone deaf singing.

Today I decided that if she was going to sing or hum, I would repeatedly say ""no"" until she stopped.  The first time took about 3 minutes of me saying  ""no, no, nope, nuh uh, no way, no,..."" I gradually increased my displeasure until she stopped.  After the third time, she would start  and I would ""no"" her right away.

This morning as I was driving up the parking deck there was a guy in a white BMW riding my tail as I drove up each floor. As I feel like everyone knows, rounding corners in a parking deck can be a little dangerous. As I prepare to round the corner to the 4th floor, I realize I have to sneeze. I apply the brake for 1 second so I can sneeze before continuing around the low-visibility corner, and the guy behind me in the white BMW honks at me for pausing for 1 second. I didn’t like this at all. It was still early for me and loud noises are not my favorite when I’m sleepy. Anyway, I continue to drive and notice the 6th floor has a bunch of open spots, and captain dickhead is still behind me. So, I park at the closest spot to the elevator on the 6th floor, and hustle to get on the elevator. I should mention, at this point, the parking deck only has one elevator on this side of the building, and it’s very slow. It’s so slow that when you are on it, you’re barely aware that is moving at all. Anyway, I hustle to get on the elevator as I see captain dickhead walking briskly toward it. As soon as I get in the elevator I hit the 1st floor button, and then immediately after, door close button. Thankfully I ride the slow ass elevator down to the first floor solo…but I am still kind of annoyed that captain dickhead felt the need to honk at me for braking for 1 second. I know he is still up there waiting for the elevator and it is cold as shit out. As the elevator doors open to let me out on the first floor, I have a stroke of petty genius. I hit the buttons for floors 2-7 as I get off. Probably the most petty thing I’ve ever done, but damn did it feel good knowing captain dickhead would be out in the cold for at least a few more minutes.

Sorry for any typos or grammatical errors, I’m on my phone and standing outside of a theme park ride.  

Today I’m at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Orlando.  I’m here with my sister and two of her sons plus my mom.  We’ve been here since Thursday and we’re having a blast, or at least I thought we were.  Anyway, last night my sister got a bee in her bonnet or a bug up her ass and decided she was no longer speaking to me or my mom.  

I thought she would have gotten over it by this morning, but I was wrong. No worries, I’ve traveled the world on my own so I think I can handle Disney World.  

Today is our last day at the parks and I was given 2 FastPass+ tickets that allow me to take up to 5 people through the FastPass lane of any ride at any time.  As soon as we got inside the gates, she took my nephews and walked off. 

I stayed with my mom and we ended up watching March of the First Order, which she loved.  Afterwards we went to the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, my favorite ride at Hollywood Studios, as well as my sisters’.  

My sister finally joined us there after a bit.  Here’s where my petty comes in.  The standby line was 85 minutes, so I told my mom I was getting on, she points out the wait time, and that’s when I whipped out the first FastPass+, and to rub it in a bit more, I went to the end of the standby line and found four other people and we went through the FastPass lane.  

I’ve lost my voice but it was worth it for the look on my sisters’ face when I got back.  I won’t wait in the line with her and neither will my mom plus her kids don’t like this ride, so she’s SOL.

We’re still at the park and I do have that 2nd pass burning a hole in my pocket. It looks like her other favorite ride currently has a 95 minute wait time....whatever shall I do? 

EDIT: I told my friend (the cast member who gave me the passes) what was going on.  He’s checking to see if any other CMs have more FastPass+ to give me so I can just go around taunting her by giving them away.  He also reminded me that I control all MagicBands on the My Disney Experience app, and I could just deactivate hers to really mess with her.

I'm waiting in line, secretly high fiving myself for being able to get in and out in under 30 minutes and probably out for under $200. Thinking about nothing in particular, my reverie is interrupted by an irate little man in front of me berating and yelling at the cashier.

Note: I'm in Canada, so no liquor is sold at Costco stores here.

""What do you mean you don't sell liquor here? Where's all the liquor?!"" The cashier, interjecting nicely, repeatedly says that they don't sell liquor at Costco here and perhaps he can go to a provincial liquor store. Nope, he carries on. ""Well AT HOME I can get liquor!""

Resisting the urge to snap back with ""are you at home?"" I said instead ""dude there's one right next door, just pop over on your way out."" I wink at the cashier and hope she doesn't correct me. 

Placated, he sighs loudly and shuts up. Cashes out, leaves.

There's no liquor store next door. There's no liquor store within walking distance anywhere nearby. By the time he realizes this after wandering around with his massive Costco haul and cursing me I'll be long gone, enjoying my Friday night.

I moved into my apartment in September, it's my first apartment and I moved in with a high school friend of mine who also happened to be looking for somewhere to live. He had always been wonderful with paying bills and to this day, we haven't had any issues with that. The only issues we've had are with his dog and the premise of this story, food/alcohol.

Now, from the beginning we had the agreement that everything in the fridge was fair game and same with the pantry. Being the only one that truly cooks in the house, almost all the food is mine. I didn't mind him eating the food, he would occasionally bring us home food from work (he works at a restaurant).

However, my boyfriend being 5 years older than us(25), was also legally able to drink. My roommate turned 21 in November, so he was unable to buy his own alcohol and he would bum a lot of it off of us without asking as fridge = fairgame. I didn't care at all, my boyfriend didn't mind either. 

Then the petty shit happened. He turned 21 in November, and immediately started stocking our fridge with alcohol. I didn't mind, plenty of room. This was good until one day I didn't have time to drop by the liquor store, so I grabbed a couple of beers and headed out. Almost immediately after I leave I get a text from my roommate. He's mad I took his beers. He says, ""Can you not touch my beers again?"". I was kinda confused, but I understood and said ""No worries, I'll replace them.""

He continues by saying, ""That's not the point, I told you not to touch them, so answer yes or no to what I said.""
Again, we had agreed everything was fair game. So I was a bit taken aback by this. I didn't understand why he could take my stuff and then get mad when I took his, but I said fuck it and said I wouldn't take his stuff. 

So, after a long weekend away, I come back and he had COMPLETELY emptied the fridge of most foods and ALL the alcohol (including mine!) and bought a mini fridge to keep it all in his room where I couldn't get it. I was furious. First, I bought ALL of that, second, he always gives me shit about running up the electric (which I don't do, we just have electric heating) yet he buys a mini fridge!

So I took the logical next step. I put a padlock on the pantry, fridge, and freezer because EVERYTHING in there was bought by me. He apologized as soon as he saw it, got rid of the minifridge and after I took off the padlocks, never complained about me taking stuff again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/86c0td/roommate_takes_my_stuff_but_gets_salty_when_i/,pettyrevenge,357,0.0

It had snowed a bunch and so I went out to clear a spot for my boyfriend at the time for when he got home from work (police officer). I spent a while digging it out, and as I was finishing up some girl drove up and parked in it (**while I was still shoveling it**!). I told her that I just dug it out intending to use it and asked her to move, and she didn't. She then got out of her car and walked away... Turns out she lived two buildings down so she normally wouldn't park there anyways!

 Our complex had a mini snow plow and the dude was plowing in the area and saw this all go down. He helped me move all the snow from the pile he just created and put it all around her car. We buried it up to the door handles on all sides. He then dug out a new spot for me. 

Saw her later trying to dig out her car, turns out she didn't have a shovel. So, naturally, bc I'm petty I went out and reshovelled the sidewalk from the lot up to our building, and threw all of the snow on her vehicle while I did it. Then went inside and took my shovel with me.

Edit 2: thanks for the gold!

Edit 3: answers to questions for clarification. I only mentioned bf was a cop to justify why he was at work during all the snow, which was why I was digging him out a spot.

He's super two faced and constantly gossips about other employees, which is stupid because I work for a really small company and everyone always finds out what's been said about them. Last week one of my coworkers quit on the spot because he yelled at her for something that was his fault. Anyways, bad guy. You get the point.

Now, I didn't plan this revenge, it moreso just started happening and I'm a petty person and continued it once I realized the effect, but one of my coworkers just walked over to me with a sheet of bubble wrap and I started popping it at my desk. My monitor and some other machines block my desk from Stinky's view, so he keeps looking around all irritated with his little stink eye trying to figure out what's making that sound. He's gotten up twice and looked around the room to figure it out, but the bubble wrap is in my drawer and he can't see it. I'm currently sitting here writing this and popping bubbles slowly wearing the straightest face my gay ass can pull off and watching Stinky lose his mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/85ulea/oh_youre_a_horrible_gossipy_manager_dont_mind_if/,pettyrevenge,119,1.0
2018-03-19 16:43:10+00:00,11310,Enjoy that 0 on the final exam,Bradleydrivn,"This was the end of senior year of undergrad - I was rather studious...never missed a class, paid attention, turned in every assignment on time, got good grades. This other kid in class was nice enough, but a slacker, would bang his phone all class and was the worst group teammate. 

Throughout the term, we would say 'hi' in passing but that's about it. Desks in this class were the type where 2-people desks, and while there were no assigned seats, students tend to sit in the same seats all semester. So it struck me odd that when I sat in my seat, well-prepared for the final, that Mr. Slacker immediately sat next to me. 

The exam was to be 80% scantron/multiple choice and 20% essay…and was to be 50% of our final grade in the class. I had a strong feeling the extent of Mr. Slacker’s exam-preparation was his plan to cheat off of me. Professor was so lax, he sat at the front reading during exams. 

Sure enough, every time I turned a page, he turned a page, when I would fill in a circle, he would fill in a circle.  Some students huddle over their papers to fend off cheaters, I leaned back, making it exceptionally easy for him. The only problem for him, though, was I would make a tiny dot next to the correct answer and fill in the wrong bubble for all 80 questions. Not surprisingly, we finished the multiple choice section at the exact same time, and I moved on to the essay section. Mr. Slacker, however, felt that 80 (or maybe a few wrong) of the total 100, was good enough, and he went ahead and turned in his exam, skipping the essay section altogether. 

I finished the long answers, corrected my scantron, and turned it all in. Did not hear his name called at graduation. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/85kwls/enjoy_that_0_on_the_final_exam/,pettyrevenge,475,0.0
2018-03-17 16:13:31+00:00,7315,Tailgating? Here. Have a pothole.,justyouandme2014,"I know that we are all guilty of tailgating, myself included. However, for those of us that realize what we are doing, we back off and continue on our merry way. Today someone had the misfortune of not having self-awareness.

Today I was on my way to the grocery store on a beautiful New England winter day with the sun shining. I was on a road that had a 45 mph speed limit and I was probably traveling just over 50mph. This lady in a Nissan kept riding my ass for about 4 miles. After she came several feet from my bumper I did tap my brakes a couple times to hopefully make her aware that she is riding up my butt. No such luck. So when I saw the opportunity I took it. There was a good size pot hole taking up half of our traveling Lane, and in order to avoid it completely you had to swerve into the oncoming lane. Because I wasn’t tailgating the person in front of me, I saw that it was there. She did not. So I waited until the very last second to swerve out of the way. She drove straight into the pothole and blew out her tire and rim. So while she is sitting waiting for a tow truck or someone to come along and change her tire, I headed to the grocery store to enjoy the rest of my day.

2018-03-15 15:29:20+00:00,3261,I won the breakup over a phone,Phoneboiii-III,"So my (now) ex totally took advantage of me. He was twice my age, was unemployed, and I basically babied him for about 9 months while he “looked for a job”. One of the things he did for me during all this was he added me to his phone plan and got me a brand new phone as a surprise gift. Great. I knew what he was doing, he was trying to get me to pay for his phone plan because he never had any money. Of course totally naïve me rolled with it. I shelled out about $200 a month for a shared phone plan with 2 new expensive phones and a tablet. I found out much later that I wasn’t even listed on the plan. 

To make a long story short we ended up breaking up a few weeks ago, because I finally got the balls to say “enough is enough” and end it. It was not a good breakup and I was the adult during it (funny how someone twice as old as me acts like a child). As his final middle finger, he took my phone with him because “it’s in his name”. 

That phone still has over $600 left to be paid on it. 

So, I took my card off the payments list right away. I also remotely bricked the phone once I found out he was still using it to send nasty texts to my friends. 

So now, he has an entry-level job where he makes barely enough to afford rent for himself, and he has a $200 phone bill, and on top of that he has to pay for a phone he can’t even use. To make everything better, he also dropped his own phone and totally shattered the screen. My phone’s screen in in perfect condition still, but again, it’s been deactivated so he has a lot to do before he can use it again. 

And I got a free upgrade because one of my friends works for Verizon. 

Checkmate. 

Tl:dr - asshole boyfriend takes my phone that I still owe money on, I turn it into a brick and now he has to pay for it and drive himself further into debt. 

Edit: several reputable users have pointed out a mistake that I made, in that payments made on-time don’t boost credit. He wasn’t getting a credit boost due to my naïvety of paying for him. Thanks for the clarification, I took that part out.

Edit numero dos: I also took out the part where I said he couldn’t use it. To clarify, I reported it as lost through Find my iPhone and erased the phone. He has the opportunity to switch to the non-shattered phone if he wants to (and honestly he should probably just go ahead and do that). The point here is that he now has 2 devices to make payments on that he wasn’t paying before. If that’s not petty revenge I don’t know what is anymore.

Loves the kids, defends the family to the end, helps out even when it is really inconvenient.  Also a master of the guilt trip, smoker, (sober for the last year) former raging mad alcoholic, drama queen.

MIL wants to take our daughters out for lunch.  Hubs says “ok mom, you can either let them have a pop at lunch OR walk them to the corner store for a coke OR ice cream afterwards.""

The result? They get a frozen slushy at the fast food place after two bites of junk food, then MIL herds them over to the store for a bottle of sugary soda AND an ice cream sandwich.  Those little girls (age 6 and 4) didn’t sit still, quiet down, or fall asleep until past midnight.

The above is not an isolated incident, but a great example of a pattern of behavior.

One particular supermarket chain (where MIL does 95% of her shopping and we do maybe 20% of ours) has partnered with a major fuel station chain to offer discounts on fuel with a qualifying level of grocery purchases.  You can input your phone number at the pump to receive a small percentage off your fuel purchase.  Once the discount is used, you must purchase more grocery to obtain another discount.

MIL has not been able to redeem a fuel reward in the last 3 years.  I use her phone number every time I fuel up.

One day, I’m over there packaging up some fresh-baked cookies, and there was a bit of a line-up at the deli (which was right next to the bakery counter). Now, I was not trained on those terrifying ‘meat’ slicers, nor did I want to be. So I kept about minding my own business with the cookies. An old man asked me a question about a cake, and I answered him.

Enter Curly Cu.... Curly Sue, we’ll call her Curly Sue.

She asks (read - demanded) that I help at the deli counter, didn’t I notice that there was a line up, blah blah blah. I smiled and said I was sorry, but I was not trained in the deli area, but if there was anything I could help with, I’d be happy to. Then I went back to the cookies, choosing to ignore her “unbelievable” comment and accompanying eye roll.

A week later, I was in the office doing the accounts receivable for the week’s deliveries, and I notice an email that had been printed out. Curly Sue had emailed the boss about that dumpy girl with the glasses (FYI - I had just lost 60 pounds and climbed the stairs of the tallest building in the world, so eat your ‘dumpy’) ignoring the busy deli, being rude to Cake Man, being rude to her, blah blah. The usual “I’m never coming back to your store because I’ve got a stick up my buttocks” line familiar to all who have worked customer service.

I wrote the woman’s email address down on a scrap of paper, and went back to my accounts receivable.

That night, I went on the websites of a few well-known soft core magazines, and signed her up to receive their daily emails, then tossed the scrap of paper with her email on it, and relished in my petty revenge joys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/840oov/enjoy_your_porn/,pettyrevenge,214,0.0
2018-03-12 03:16:12+00:00,3380,"Oh, so you're in a rush? Have being late for your movie.",comfycheesecake,"I work at a movie theater. It's not a huge chain like AMC, but the owners have quite a few of them. The work environment is great, but when we get busy there are often times where I question why I do all of this shit for minimum wage. Opening night of Black Panther was one of those nights.

There was one line open to buy tickets, and two lines to buy concessions. All three lines were out the door, but as we were the only theater with seating still available for Black Panther (we had 2 screenings showing at once) people were willing to wait in line. Now, enter Dicky Customer. He looks exactly like you'd expect him to. Middle aged, balding, trailed by a small pilgrimage of ill-behaved children, the male equivilant of the ""can I speak to your manager"" haircut. DC had bought his tickets online. The receipt you receive says you still have to have an attendee print them out. We have signs posted everywhere saying you still have to have an attendee print them out. Yet for some reason when DC went up to our ticket taker with just his receipts and was told he needed an attendee to print them out, he acted like Copernicus just informed him that the Earth went around the Sun. People make this mistake all the time, and usually if they're polite about the whole thing its no problem to let them zip in front of the line real quick and print out their tickets while customers are waiting on their concessions. 

DC, as I'm sure you can guess, was not polite. 

He storms up to the front of my concession line with the fury only a truly wronged man can possess. He quite literally pushes the old lady I'm serving out of the way with his shoulder and slams down his receipts on the counter (making my pen drop to the floor, might I add), his eyes burning with the fiery rage of a thousand dying suns. And yet I still would have probably printed out his tickets if he had just kept his mouth shut.

""You have to print my movie tickets."" He demanded. ""Black Panther starts in ten minutes and that fucking dumbass over there just told me I can't go in even though I bought my tickets online. So just hurry up and print them real quick so that we can make it, huh sweetie? ""

You see, this was DC's grave mistake. That ""fucking dumbass"", as he so eloquently put it, was a 60 year old man named Phil. Phil is a saint. He's worked at this place for longer than I've been alive, routinely buys doughnuts for the whole crew, and has a surprisingly amount of trivial knowledge about medieval Europe. To insult Phil was to insult everybody at our workplace, and by God I would not stand for it. 

I put on my best retail smile. ""I'm sorry sir, but I'm helping another customer right now. You'll have to wait in the ticket line if you want your tickets to be printed out. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but at least now you know for next time!"" 

DC looks behind him towards the ticket line. It is still out the door, hasn't moved more than 5 feet since this interaction started, and has to be at least a 20 minute wait. Black Panther now starts in exactly 7 minutes, and the theater is almost full. I can see the wheels begin to turn in DC's head as he realizes there's no way for his entire clan of manlet spawn to fit into the theater together at this point. It's at that point when he should've resorted to begging, but a manlet's pride is his only shield. 

""We're going to miss our movie. I just need these damn tickets printed.""

As DC is slowly realizing, I am not a merciful god. ""I'm sorry sir, but we're just too busy at the moment. You'll have to wait in line with everybody else."" The conversation is over, and I help the next customer. The fire in DC's eyes dies as he realizes he does have to wait in line like the rest of the common folk, and I didn't think I'd feel any greater satisfaction than when I saw him crawl to the back of the ticket line. At least, until I saw him again 30 minutes later giving his tickets to Phil, a rampaging horde of children behind him screaming about how they're missing the movie. 

So remember, kids: please and thank you goes a long way, and never, EVER insult the people responsible for your tickets.

So anyways we get to Waffle House and he tells everyone their fares and they start paying. As one guy leaves he forgets his 50 dollars in change. The taxi driver calls for him but faint heartedly and doesn’t really put forth the effort. I tried using card but he doesn’t accept card so he drove me a block down the street to an atm to get money and before I hop out I made a joke saying “How about you just take my fare from that 50?” 
And his chubby ass tells me “how about you stop being cheap and go get me my fucking money?” 
So I go get 2 20s from the atm and he drives me back up the street to Waffle House my fare is 8.75 and I told him no no let me go inside and get you exact change so I walk inside find the guys who were just in the cab with me and tell him he forgot his change. He was pretty thankful as he’s about to walk out I ask him to take my fare down to the taxi with him.

The scene: an amusement park bathroom, late afternoon. There are signs posted everywhere stating the stalls aren’t to be used to change in. 

The characters: myself, a wheelchair bound 13 year old who has to pee really badly. Because of the logistics of using the bathroom, I tend to wait until I really need to. Not healthy, I know, but it’s a hassle and a half. I’m with My mom, who helps me transfer from my chair to the potty. She is amazing but impatient woman. 

The plot: we enter the crowded bathroom and find that the lone handicapped stall is being used by a woman as a dressing room. I can hear her on her phone as she changes, taking her sweet time. The next closest bathroom is a ways away so I’m resigned to wait while my mom fumes. 

I sigh and sit near the stall. And tell my mom to calm down, it’s okay. Finally after another fifteen minutes, the stall opens and the woman exits. 

“Excuse me,” I say politely as she brushes past me. She stops and turns. 

“Did you leave your wheelchair at home?”

No idea why she glared at me /s

2018-03-08 16:48:36+00:00,13391,"Sister always steals my food, I make a fool of myself on her graduation to stop her.",BranMoffTarkin,"I come from a family of 6: my parents, my older sister, my older brother, my little brother, and me. Often, in order to bribe us into good behavior, our parents would buy us our favorite candy to munch on in the car. Now, I've never exactly been a giving person, not huge on sharing just for the sake of sharing. My parents, however, were trying to raise respectful and generous kids, and often forced me to share things even when I didn't want to. 

That's all fine and good, except that my sister abused this system. See, she would say she didn't want a bag of candy, then once we were on the road she'd start taking candy from all three of the brothers. That really pissed me off. I didn't get candy often, as my mom didn't like feeding us sugary food, so when I got my own bag of Sour Patch Watermelon I wanted to eat every last one myself. Besides, my parents would always offer to buy her a bag of candy for herself, she would just refuse because she knew she could leech off the rest of us. So after a point I started refusing her requests for candy. But that shit didn't fly with my mom, because that was being selfish, so she would force me to hand over the candy. One time I even said when I purchased my bag at CVS, ""*sister*, I'm not going to give you any of my candy. If you want sour patch, buy your own right now."" ""I'm fine,"" she responded, ""I don't want a whole bag of candy."" Fast forward 20 minutes into the car ride, my father was requisitioning a candy to give to my sister, as I sat fuming. 

This went on for years. My whole life, really. And I hated it. I would hide my candy when I got it, I would try and keep it out of her reach, but always a parent would intervene. 

Fast forward to my sister's college graduation. She is now 22, I am a senior in high school at this point, and we're up at her school at a fancy ass restaurant celebrating after she had graduated that morning. In attendance are all immediate and some extended family, some close friends of my sister, and her long term boyfriend who I was meeting for the first time. 

So, enough people for the following to be embarrassing to my family. 

Our meal ends and my mother offers to buy a nice dessert for anyone who wants it. My brothers, my dad and I all take her up on it. I ordered a vanilla bean cheesecake with a burnt sugar birds nest on top. My mother repeatedly offers to buy my sister anything she wants, but my sister says she couldn't possibly eat a full dessert right now, and turns it down every time. 

The food arrives, and everyone is staring at mine. I'm sitting right at the head of the table in full view of everyone, so it's hard not to look, and aside from the cake slice being large and delicious looking, the burnt sugar birds nest is huge and ornate, hollow on the inside like a fucking old timey brass globe or some shit. Honestly, it was pretty impressive. 

And right as the food gets placed in front of us, my sister says, ""I'll just have a bite of everyone's""

At this point, I'm seeing red, having flashbacks to all the times my food has been stolen. Logically, the right thing to do would've been to just hand over one bite. I mean, it was her graduation, it was a huge cake, it would've been no loss. But it had become a matter of principle. 

So, the moment she says this, in one fell swoop, in full view of everyone at the table, I sweep up my slice of cheesecake and stuff the entire thing into my mouth at once, shattering the sugar nest, crumbs falling everywhere, in front of my whole family and some college students close to my sister who, again, never met in my life. 

My sister stares, appalled, and says, ""Did you do that just so I wouldn't get any?!?""

And I look at her, cheeks ballooning out like a chipmunk, face covered in cheesecake and graham, dead in the eyes and nod. 

There was a fair bit of shocked silence, at that moment and in the very tense car ride home. But to this day she never asks for anything from me anymore. 

TL;DR sister always steals my desserts, so I shoved an entire piece of cake in my mouth in front of strangers and family alike to prevent her from getting any

So this lady comes over to me and asks me where the hair colour chart was and I pointed her in the right direction.

After about 5 minutes she finds me in another aisle and starts to ask me a bunch of questions I didn’t know the answer to, so I politely say that I don’t know and she should ask someone else. 

She then begins to say that she wants to speak to my manager, and that someone so unhelpful shouldn’t work here, and storms off. I’m super annoyed at this point and seeing as I knew there was only one girl working I rushed to the counter to beat this lady to it and honestly the look on the lady’s face when she saw I was just a regular customer was priceless.

Some prick was stealing food and drink from the work fridge, I’d complained about it, as had several others.
I’d left notes on the fridge asking the thief to fuck off, I put it on my lunches and drinks in sharpie.
It’d been going on for months.
I was fond of getting a two for one dare ice coffee from the servo down the road. One for today, one for tomorrow, right?

So after like the 3rd time of me being dumb enough to leave my drink in the fridge overnight, sure enough, the arsehole had opened it and drank about 2/3.
He even had the audacity to put the shit back after he drank most of it.
At one point I even thought I had a great idea, I would open the drink before he got a chance to and drink some.
Maybe my cooties would deter him?
Not a fucking chance.
Numbnuts would just finish it off if I was so uncourteous as to drink some.

So I got the shits. Lost my temper a little and decided enough was enough.
I took my dare ice coffee, drank half of it, and pissed in the rest.
It was one of the larger, 750ml ones.
I filled up to about 90-80%, and put it back.

Next day, at 7am, I am called to the managers office before I start.
My manager is in there with some chronie from the office upstairs.
Straight up ask me, “did you piss in your drink in the work fridge?”
I managed to suppress my laughter and just say, 
 “yep, who drank it?”
He got beet red and started reading the termination policy, saying that what I did was not in compliance with the company.
I said some dumb shit like, “so your telling me, that if I choose to bring some of my own urine to work for a drink, and someone steals it from me, that I am breaking policy?”
He stammered for a bit and said something about it being a food place and my urine is unsanitary.
I just kept going, “urine is sterile and stored in the break room. There is no law against drinking your own urine, but there is one against theft. Show me where it says in the company policy I can’t drink my own urine.”

He was lost for words for a bit, and said, “well I’ll have to look into that.” After a moment of shuffling and looking through his papers he tried to start again. “ what you did was malicious-“
I just cut him off and said, “ I can see you’ve made up your mind, I’ll just leave.”

Sucked for a while because the pay was great, but I’m happier now and earn more.
So happy ending?

Also found out from friends, that it was indeed he who was stealing.
Turns out he was stealing more than just lunches.
Was also a massive coke fiend.
I now understand why he was sweating in 0 degree (Celsius) weather, wearing nothing but a button up shirt and slacks.

I took my shoe off, tapped the toe, and dumped the sweaty wad onto the floor. She wasn’t even paying attention so she had no idea I even did this. I thumped the wet, smelly wad onto the counter and, still looking the other direction, she picked it up. I told her to keep the change and walked away right as the smell began to emanate from the hideous mass.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/81fv1j/panera_messes_up_my_order_for_the_fifth_time_so/,pettyrevenge,171,0.0
2018-03-01 17:24:54+00:00,10623,Wife took petty revenge on my mom,bur1sm,"This past weekend my mom visited me in Canada from Ohio to celebrate my daughter's birthday. We've been though several periods of no contact through out my adult life because of these issues. Then eventually I'd feel bad and let her back into my life. Then she starts the cycle of verbal and emotional abuse again and trying to cross any boundaries I gave established.

She spent most of the trip lecturing everyone she could about Donald Trump and guns. None of my friends or in-laws up here are American. Everyone is pretty left-leaning just like her. I am also very left-leaning, but I've grown up with guns because my dad collected them and would go shooting with them occasionally. During one of these rants I made the mistake of saying I didn't really care too much about guns, but I enjoyed going to the gun range with my brother-in-law. I also said I understood why people want to own guns and felt like they needed them to protect themselves and their family. Hoo boy. 

In my mom's eyes that made me some right wing gun nut who was okay with school shootings. I wish I was being hyperbolic but I'm not. At one point she said next time I went to the gun range with my brother-in-law that she hoped I heard the screams of the children at Parkland in my head. She also said she hoped my daughter was safe WHEN I buy a gun. 

Over the visit it became clear this is going to be one of those interactions where things are going to spiral into a tornado of craziness that will affect everyone's lives that are even tangentially involved in the fight. It culminated with us getting into an argument in the car and her cancelling the whole visit. It would have ended there but my mom came back to my house five times to continue the fight. I told her to leave several times before I called the police because she tried to force her way in and was making a scene in front of my house. She ended up checking out of her hotel heading home before the police could ever talk to her and tell her to stay off of my property. 

The next couple days she sent me texts and leaving voicemails filled with insults and more nonsense about guns and Donald Trump. As if the crux of our disagreement was about guns, and not her shitty parenting or her refusal to get help for what I'm pretty sure is some kind of personality disorder. 

So yesterday I was telling my wife about some of the texts and voicemails I had received from my mom and my wife said to me, ""I did something bad."" I asked her what it was and she told me that she almost wrote my mom an email telling her off. Luckily my wife said she was way too Canadian for an actual confrontation. 

So her revenge? ""I signed your mom up for every NRA and gun mailing list I could find.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/816ye6/wife_took_petty_revenge_on_my_mom/,pettyrevenge,432,0.0
2018-02-28 18:14:24+00:00,4372,Hell hath no fury like a student without a parking spot,rames1208,"My college campus is tiny and the school's student population is constantly growing, which makes finding a parking spot pretty difficult. Since I commute to school every day I try to get to campus as early as possible to find a parking spot, and I've found a little corner of campus that no one really goes to which typically has at least a few parking spots available. I've grown fond of this corner-- I typically see the same people parking over here and we have begun to wave hello to each other. 

This morning, a new car decided to join our little corner. Except they decided to park diagonally across two different parking spots, leaving me and someone else out of a spot. Fueled by my morning coffee and anger from being cheated out of a parking spot, I called our campus safety police. I could tell the officer was in desperate need of some entertainment when I told him about the car and he went ""oh ho ho really?"" He excitedly asked me for the car's license plate number and assured me that they would be contacting the owner of the car and would issue a ticket if the owner didn't respond. I finished the call satisfied and left for class. 

But wait, there's more! About 5 hours later, at the very end of the day, I returned to the corner to fetch my car and saw that the diagonally parked car was *still there* and had like 3 tickets on it.

2018-02-27 15:12:22+00:00,2308,Tail me while I‘m at speed limit? Have fun with the cops!,Rahega,"I‘m on my mobile so I apologise for wall of text and also English is not my native language, so please go easy on me!

I was going out for a night of partying with a friend. We live in a very rural area so if we want to go out, we need to drive 45mins to the next bigger city. 
The main street going there is limited at 80km/h (about 50mph) as it is very curvy, going along farm lands and has a lot of animals crossing. 

15 mins into the drive a BMW with 2 young douche-y looking guys come speeding up behind me. The driver keeps up his high speed (guess was about 120km/h) and breaks just before he was hitting me. I was driving the speed limit of 80km/h (I’ve hit a marten (I hope I translated it right, small raccoon like animal)) there before because I was speeding a bit. Learned my lesson and drive at the speed limit now. 

They tail us for 5 mins before they decided they’ve had enough. He starts to honk his horn continuously and using his flashlight to irritate me. All while driving past numerous signs of it being a 80km/h road. He couldn’t overtake me because of all the curves and traffic. 
I kept my pace at 80km/h and tried to ignore those douches. But it only got worse. 
They then proceeded to drive even closer to me, flipping me off, breaking and then speeding up to me again and almost hitting me every time they did it. 

I got really angry (my friend said my head turned bright red) and I slowed down to 75 km/h because I was sick of their shit. That obviously drove them even madder and they continued their spiel. 

That’s when I plotted my sweet revenge. 
About 10mins before reaching the big city, the street turns into a „fast road“ where they have a permanent speed camera about 500m into the road. The road also splits up into a 2-lane-road and the speed limit is increased to 100km/h (60mph). I’m pretty sure they knew of the speed camera but I’ve had them at a point where they were so mad they forgot about it. 

So right before the street splits, I start speeding up to 100km/h with the douche BMW boys still close on my behind. As soon as the street split up, they speed up like insane and swoosh past me. And right into the speed camera. They were going at least 120km/h. As they realised that I’ve just tricked them into the speeding camera, they pull in infront of me and start breaking like crazy all while flipping me off through the windows. 

And now to my favourite part. The car which was driving behind them was a private police car. They’ve watched the whole thing. And they turned on their siren, pulled in infront of the BMW and pulled him out. As we passed the BMW while they were pulled out by the cops, my friend and I waved at them with the biggest smile while glancing in the most infuriated eyes I’ve ever seen!

TL;DR: BMW douches were tailing me and flipping me off despite me going the speed limit. I slowed down a bit, making them angrier and tricked them into a speed camera. They then breakchecked me hard and cops saw all of that and pulled them over.

But something about his tone just pissed me off, and I said, ""I'll wait for the announcement.""  He gave me a hostile glare.  ""I ASKED you NICELY.""  No, prick, you ordered me rudely.  But whatever.  I saw him trying to flag down the attendant to report me, and eventually he did catch one's eye, at which point I silently whisked the bag away, out of her view.  He didn't notice it because he was watching her approaching.  He gave her his aggrieved complaint and then turned to point at... nothing.  She looked over the seat at me, and I made the universal finger-twirling to temple ""what a loony"" gesture.  She gave me a sympathetic look and walked off, leaving the man to stew.

2018-02-25 15:52:20+00:00,4247,I know you stole my ping pong ball.,Alabastre,"Around 5 years ago, I was in this electrician school and there was this guy in my class. I'll call him Chester. He was the sort of guy who'd say ""this teacher is so gay,"" and then do a burnout in the school parking lot. 

One day, he asked if he could he could borrow my ping pong ball during break (my school had table tennis AKA ping pong tables). I said sure, and lent him a ball so he could play with his equally shitty friend. Later, I caught up with him and asked for my ball back:

Chester: I already gave it back to you.

Me: I haven't seen you since lunch.

Chester: Yeah, I gave it back.

Me: Okay.

I knew he didn't give it back and was lying to my face, but whatever. It's a small price to pay to learn that I don't trust the guy.

Later that week, I'm in class getting ready to write a test when Chester sits beside me. Usually he sits in the back of the room with his shitty friend. The test begins, and Chester leans over and whispers to me:

Chester: Hook me up with some answers.

Me (also whispering): No.

Chester: Come on, we'll look out for eachother.

I get to the second question and notice Chester's head is practically hovering over my test sheet. I tell him to fuck off, but he persists. So I get an idea. I start answering every question wrong. The test was all multiple choice, so my great idea is to always select the answer below the correct answer. I finish the whole test, pretending I don't notice him copying everything.

When the test is over, I'm expecting him to get up and leave, but he does something even better. He takes out his phone and starts texting all the answers to his friend! Meanwhile, I'm trying to look like I'm looking over my answers.

He and his friend hand in their tests, leave, and peel out of the school parking lot. I quickly revert all my answers to the correct ones.

Later, when we got the results, I found out that Chester and his shitty friend failed the test and had to retake the class. I'd like to say I did this out of moral obligation as a good student. But deep down, I needed revenge for my ping pong ball.

2018-02-24 14:20:12+00:00,2619,Chew me out because YOU'RE late? I hope you're patient!,areesaw,"A little bit of context: I work at a certain hardware store as the vault/computer room employee. I come in early at around 5h15AM each weekend to prepare the register money, count the bills and do some tech support. 

I usually stay in the computer room, locked behind two heavy, locked doors, containing the safe and a computer where i do my stuff. I send the money with a tube system that connects to the registers so I dont have to walk all the way over there each time someone needs something. 

Now, there's this new manager. Well, not really a manager but a ""head cashier"", which is like a super-cashier i guess. She is always very stressful and thinks very highly of herself. She is very condescending and loves to remind me that she is ""the head cashier for a reason"" even though I have the same job title as her, except I work in the computer room, and due to conflicts of interests, I cannot be head cashier and vault employee, which is fine.

Also, this girl is all over the place. I have a very strict schedule to send the tubes and the ""head cashier till"", which is a padlocked drawer containing money if the cashiers need some extra 20s or rolls of change. Usually, I sent that around 8 o'clock in several tubes, but she's late and calls my phone in a PANIC shrieking about the till and ""it should be HERE ALREADY?!? You should do your job!! Im freaking out over here! Send it now!"" and she hangs up on me without even a good morning. Thing is, it would be very irresponsible to send that amount of money in an unsupervised location without anyone checking it is safely put in the drawer, so I don't send it until someone calls me. 

I decide to plot a petty revenge that had me cackling all morning. You see, the till contains a lot of money, so I must send it in several tubes. To place that money in the drawer, you need a special key. If you dont have the key, the tubes are just gonna pile up while you wait in front of the machine because you can't just leave that cash there even though the store is not open at that point, the store opens at 8 on weekends. It usually takes around 10 minutes to receive/send all the tubes and it's a good thing to send the key first so the head cashier on the other end can begin unloading the tubes in the drawer and process augmentations if they need to.

So I sent the key last.

I know its SUPER petty, but just the thought of this huge control freak opening tube after tube and not finding the key while she has to rush because she's one hour late is hilarious to me. As soon as I began sending the tubes my phone started ringing, it was her. I kept sending my tubes in feigned ignorance, keeping the key until the very last tube, while the phone ringed with the head cashier probably freaking out at the other end.

Made my day a tiny bit better.

EDIT: I would never fuck the store over for a petty prank. When there's no head cashier (for example when we open at 6am during the weeks), I take care of everything from the vault. Everything was fine and the cashiers already had their own registers filled by me in the morning.

2018-02-23 13:56:17+00:00,9503,Never piss off the photographer. Never.,HalfPintMarmite,"(Apparently this is something you guys might enjoy. XD)


I'm not a professional photographer, but friends and family ask me to take photos for them all the time. I love portrait photography and I'm happy to do the favour, but sometimes people are *really* awful/annoying and then it really grates that I'm spending my evening/weekend shooting and then processing photos for free.     


A few years ago I had a really really bad client. A colleague asked me to do a family shoot on Mother's day. I knew I'd have the morning to play with before going to see my own Mum so I accepted. It was going to be at a winery in the country, and my colleague offered to pay for me to join them for brunch. Bonus. 


We carpooled, and it wasn't until we got there that I realised that it wasn't just going to be my colleague, her husband and her kids... It was my colleague's husband's entire family - brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, parents, and even both grandmas. 27 people. I'm immediately panicking about how long it's going to take to do this shoot and mention to my colleague (C) and her husband (CH) that I have to leave in three hours to get back for my family Mother's Day. CH says it'll be fine. I don't really have a choice, as we carpooled, so I try and relax and have fun.


Brunch goes on forever, and when we're finished we only have an hour for photos. I figure that should be fine, if cutting it close, and I ask for CH's help in keeping his family organised and moving. I plan out the normal shots with CH - everyone together, family groups, kids, and then CH starts asking for couples shots as well. Then siblings. I text my family, let them know I'll be a little late, but hoping it won't be too bad because CH will keep people moving.

An hour and a half later and everyone is having a bad time. The kids are crying. It's taking forever to get any shots at all. Why? Because CH is yelling at people. Hurling commands and orders, barking, foaming at the mouth. It's incredibly awful - the winery people come over a few times and ask us to keep it down. CH yells at them too. I'm praying that they kick us out. I try telling CH that I have to leave, that we can try again for photos another time. The family tries to leave. We are stopped. No. We must endure.


When he tells his son that he's going to knock the snot out of him if he doesn't stop crying something snaps in me. 


I stop trying to cheer people up, get fun photos, happy smiles, I just take the photos we need to so we can all just GTFO.


When I eventually get home I do what I can with these miserable photos. I combine different frames to get group shots where everyone looks happy. Where that doesn't work I touch up facial expressions so people look less harried. I steal bits from candid shots earlier in the day. These are impossible masterpieces when I'm through with them. I spend *hours and hours* making sure these pictures are going to hang in living rooms forever. 


Then I go through every single fucking photo featuring CH, absolutely every one, and- *just enough* to be slightly noticeable, just enough to look weird and awkward- I enlarge his head.

2018-02-21 17:56:00+00:00,2362,Want to act up? Wait for the next train and get laughed at by your friends.,Ulldra,"This is a story from my time at school, I think roughly 10 years ago around 10th grade. 

Of the 700 students in my school roughly 1/3 was going to school via train, roughly a 20-25 minute ride, that was going once every hour.

On that train after school on the way back home, there was a group of kids in grade 5 or 6. They were annoying, loud and showed no respect. Given that the train was always very loud, I did not care about that. What did bother me was the fact that one day one of those brats started to act up really big, bothering a girl in our group with comments about how he wants to touch her etc. We told him to shut up, but he did not. Instead he went and slapped her behind when she stood up to get off the train. 

I‘m usually pretty calm, but that ticked me off, so here comes the petty part. I stood up and walked over to the kid, literally lifted him up and walked over to the door holding him up. As I mentioned before, the train was pulling into the station, so I waited for the doors to open, put him down outside and closed the door again. The train driver didn‘t notice or just didn‘t care as I did this, because once the door closed the train took off. The kid started bawling his eyes out and his friends started to laugh at him.

Reflecting back this was really petty, but at least the kid learned a lesson there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7z7ixh/want_to_act_up_wait_for_the_next_train_and_get/,pettyrevenge,78,0.0

Okay, time to make you go home",empressfelicia,"So my friend and I were just eating at this popular bubble tea place in Chinatown, minding our own business. And then, here enters the three bitches that I take petty revenge on. I'll just randomly name them.... Brittney, Susan, and Deborah cause why not? Lol

Side note: I speak Cantonese (Chinese-Dialect). My friend speaks Vietnamese. At a far glance, I sometimes look more Japanese than Chinese for some reason, so that's probably why they didn't care about talking so loudly in Chinese. 

The following statements were said in Cantonese by the bitches who entered and sat at a table nearby.

&gt; Brittney: Look at that fat girl over there. Ughhh

&gt; Susan: She needs to stop eating and go to a gym

&gt; Brittney: ""'Ugly' people need to stay home instead of coming out in public."" 

[FYI, they were definitely talking about us because on top of them looking at us, there was only one other group in the back, but that group consisted of pretty skinny people]

[Another side note: In Cantonese, the word ""ugly"" can be interpreted as just ""bad-looking"" or ""unpresentable"", but the context she was using the word, it was to be offensive instead of just some opinion]

Now this went on for about.... 5 minutes.... I let my friend know (because I wasn't just gonna let her sit in the dark while these bitches talked shit about her in a fucking different language)

In English, this is what I said:

&gt; Me: Y'all got something to say?? (This was moderately loud by the way)

&gt; Brittney: Um, can you mind your own business?

&gt; Me: If y'all got shit to say, might as well say it in English.

&gt; Brittney: We're not talking about you. How about you stop eavesdropping.

Okay, you're lying to me now, huh? okay.

I devised a plan. I taught my friend the basic Cantonese words for ""Well said"", ""Yes,"" ""Exactly/Totally/Honestly"". 

&gt; Me: (In Cantonese) Sis (This is how some people refer to each other who they're close to),  look at those bitches over there. They have some nerve to talk shit, but won't be upfront about it. How pitiful.

&gt; Friend: Well said (in Cantonese)

Now I said it loud enough for them to hear. I was legit just staring them down with my friend. They noticed, and were trying to act chill about it. Other things I said were:

&gt; Me: ""If that bitch really wants to talk about 'ugly', she should check her mouth first."" (I pretty much called her a trash-talking bitch)

&gt; Me: ""You hear that? Now they're quiet. NOW they're quiet. How gullible.""

&gt; Me: ""This 'ugly' bitch is so insecure about herself, she has to talk sh#t about people behind their backs. Tsk tsk""

Now Brittney had to go get some sauce, and I thought it'd be great idea to go get napkins with my friend at the same time (napkins and sauces were next to each other at the front)

We timed it to where we ran into Brittney, and she's just looking at us. Then I say:

&gt; Me: MOVE! My 'fat' friend is coming through. You might as well back away before you get any of her 'ugly'.

Brittney backs away, and my friend and I walk over to get napkins. Then I thought of this nice gem:

&gt; Me: Aye, you 'lowly people', do y'all need napkins? Might as well clean up your mouths, or even hide your 'ugly' faces. (I used a term that translates to 'lowly person', but it's more offensive in Cantonese)

Anyways, we go back to our table and just look at the trio bitches. Finally, Brittney said something, but this time, in English.

&gt; Brittney: What do you want from me?

&gt; Me: I want you and your 'friends' to go home since yanno, 'ugly' people need to stay home instead of coming out in public.

Deborah suggests that they just apologize for the fat-shaming, but Brittney wants to be stubborn.

I continue my Cantonese comments for about a minute, before Brittney just picks up her stuff and leaves in anger. Her two friends follow a few seconds later.

I honestly took things out of proportion with my comments, but then again, it all started with the fat-shaming. Like it's okay if you call someone fat because it's kind of a ""fact"" if my friend is fat, but you don't just say how her being ""fat"" makes her ""ugly"" and then say the rest of those negative things.

tl;dr - Some girls talk shit about my friend in Cantonese. Coincidentally, I speak Cantonese, so I decide to do the exact same thing, to the point where they just leave.

2018-02-13 15:40:09+00:00,2899,Consider your travel arrangements before you ruin our friendship,huskydaisy,"This was a long time ago now but a recent post I was reading reminded me of this event and I felt it belonged here. Towards the end of sixth form (relative to 'senior year'), I had two 'friends' who I spent most of my time with. Let's call them Becky and Michelle. Michelle was very quiet and generally a nice person but Becky had a mean streak when she wanted to, although it had never been directed at me. I'd known them both for 8-10 years through school so I liked to think we were close.

One day, Becky and Michelle asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday. At the time I really, *really* wanted to see the new Harry Potter film but I was pretty sure it wasn't their thing, so while I suggested it, I also made it clear we could do something else if they wanted to, no big deal. But much to my surprise, they both agreed on the spot. Awesome. We made the plans - I was going to drive because I had just passed my test (the cinema is a 20 miles/30 mins drive in the next town over), we'd grab food and then see the late showing. 

I cannot tell you just how excited I was about this. I absolutely *loved* Harry Potter (still do) and I was thrilled to bits that my friends had taken an interest. I banged on about it for the two weeks coming up to the day, and all the way during the drive there, and all through when we were eating before the film. We're talking about supernerd-level excitement. 

Then we got to the box office.

Becky turns to me and says she and Michelle think Harry Potter is a bit crap so ""we"" (as in dictating all three of us) were going to see 'latest shitty romcom' instead. Turns out, Becky had got her dad to buy their tickets earlier in the week when he was in town and it dawns on me that this must have been their plan all along. They had every chance to tell me this before we made plans but didn't. They knew I had my heart set on seeing this film and didn't care. They had sat through me rabbiting on about dementors, brooms and hippogryphs for hours and said absolutely nothing. 

I am crestfallen. Not only at the thought of not seeing Harry Potter, or even at the way they had deceived me, but at the sudden and very clear realisation that these people who I have sat with at school and shared my life with every day for years were not my friends. It all clicks into place. Past events, little actions and comments here and there all make sense. *How could I be so stupid?*. I accept the reality, say OK and head to the ticket counter.

To this day, I am certain that Michelle and Becky 100% expected me to fall in line and buy a ticket to their film. You can imagine their surprise when I bought one for Harry Potter. I'll be damned if I'm letting them take Harry Potter away from me too. I tell them that I am watching the film I came here to see and that they should go since their film is starting soon, this earns me a beautifully confused reaction from both of them as I walk off to go buy popcorn.

The film was awesome and I was feeling increasingly better about my decision throughout. It ended at just gone 11pm and on my way out of the cinema I saw Becky and Michelle waiting for me in the lobby. Since my film started later and was longer than theirs, they must have been waiting for roughly an hour which, as it turns out, was just long enough to miss the last bus back to our hometown. Spectacularly, they somehow imagined that I would still be giving them a lift back. I didn't plan it at all but before I knew it, I was amongst the droves of other Harry Potter fans leaving the screening and it worked just as well as the invisibility cloak. I had gotten past them without being seen. I 'forgot' to turn my phone back on and then I drove home and went to bed.

The next morning I turned on my phone to several voicemails and texts. From what I could gather, Becky and Michelle waited until the cinema literally kicked them out to close up and Michelle eventually managed to wake up her dad to come get them. I decided to send back a marvelously petty reply along the lines of ""Oops. Thought you had made other plans"". I received no response.

Thankfully, we were now on study leave for our final exams so I didn't have to see them. There was no confrontation. I worked through summer then went on to a university across the country and made new friends. Michelle and I got back in touch five or so years later. Becky generally treated her the way she treated me, it just took Michelle a lot longer to see it. We're not the shithead kids we used to be 14 odd years ago and we're genuinely good friends now. 

**TL;DR** So called 'friends' arrange to go see the late showing of a Harry Potter film for my birthday and they know how excited I am about this. Turns out that they were planning to see another film all along and just used me for a free ride. So I watched Harry Potter anyway then went home, leaving them stranded in a different town 20 miles away.

2018-02-12 02:01:26+00:00,4221,Call me an asshole because I won’t give you your precious snack? Enjoy never having them again.,Canaboll,"This happened some months ago and it just occurred to me that it would fit well here. I work at a hotel in the evenings. I’m a pretty relaxed person and will go out of my way to help someone out. However, if someone is rude to me I have no problem retaliating. Fortunately I’m on a long leash with this job and can get away with a lot. Especially since I work alone. 

So a lady came up to the front desk one evening and started obnoxiously yelling “hello!?” over and over while I was in the back room on my laptop. People that do this really grate on me. So I approached this conversation already annoyed. She asked me for some Apple cinnamon oatmeal (which is something we only give in the ~~evenings~~ mornings). Normally when someone asks for breakfast stuff I just give it to them since I don’t care, but since she annoyed me right off the bat I decided to tell her that she could get some in the morning instead. 

This did not sit well with her at all! She hissed like a cat at me and exclaimed that the girl on shift the night before gave her some, and then called me an asshole for not giving her some now. I just scoffed and she walked away. I could have just left it at that, gone back to my computer and returned to my previous comatose  state. If I had done that though, then you wouldn’t be reading this. 

Instead I went to the breakfast room, opened up our drawer of oatmeal and grabbed every single apple cinnamon oatmeal I could find and put it in a bag. Then to counter my fellow employee’s helpfulness, I opened up all our boxes of oatmeal that haven’t been put away yet, and took all the Apple cinnamon oatmeal from those too. This way when she went down the next morning and demanded her beloved oatmeal, my fellow employees wouldn’t be able to dig through the new product and appease her.

All in all I had about 50+ packets of oatmeal in a bag, which I took home with me and left in a cub-board for a week just to ensure she could never have her glutinous prize. I brought them back and redistributed them amongst the other oatmeal and no one ever found out.

2018-02-10 18:54:17+00:00,2075,"Won't meet me to drop off your kids because of fake money problems, I'll make sure you have to drive there anyway.",yellowspotphoto,"This happened a couple years ago, but it still makes me grin when I think about it. 

I divorced my ex husband about 6 years ago. We have 2 kids together. He is an awful person, abusive, manipulative, and lazy. He doesn't see the kids very often, 1-2 times a year. He lives about 1000 miles away. He married an older rich lady and has nice motorcycle, cars, etc. This is important.

So the first summer they had visitation, my husband had transitioned out of the military and we were setting up a house in a new state. The timing working where I was going to drive and stay with friends along the drive up and down. I would have to stay in a hotel one night of the trip.

I was traveling with a 13 month old and 15 week old puppy. So I asked my ex husband if he could meet me 90 minutes away so I could save some time traveling with 3 kids and a new puppy. 

Of course he didn't want to do that, he said he couldn't afford the 20 bucks in gas. ""20 dollars might be not a lot of money to you, but it is for me.""  I thought about just telling him I would give him 20, but then something else popped in my head.

He lives about 90 minutes away from the closest major airport. The same city I asked him to meet me. If kids fly unaccompanied, it has to be a direct flight, so they had to leave from that airport. I research the costs of flights, find it to be affordable. It will only cost a little more than the hotel stays and gas. So, my petty self decides that this is a great idea. 

I purchase the tickets and email him. I wish I could have seen the look on his face when he opened that email. He still had to drive to the same city he would have met me if he had agreed to meet me when I was driving. He will go out of his way to help anyone except me. 

It worked out better in the end, and saved me days in a van with a baby, puppy and 2 kids. Bonus, I didn't have to see him or talk to him. 

TL,DR, My ex husband refused to meet me because he ""couldn't afford $20 in gas"". He still had to drive and use his 20 bucks to take the kids to the airport. In the same city he would have met me. 

Edited. I didn't think this would get as much attention that it is getting. For anyone saying I used my kids, think what you want. If you think I'm an asshole, I don't care. You are reading one experience out of the years I've dealt with my ex husband. After experiencing years of his  abuse, I'm left with PTSD-C, so if I get petty once every 3 years, I'll do it, guilt free.

I'm a big white dude that teaches in a mostly Hispanic middle school. I've received a lot of students from Puerto Rico and Venezuela recently. Well there's this one new kid who was, until recently, trying to prove himself by talking shit to me in Spanish. He was always passing by me in the hallways between class and saying Spanish stuff. I don't speak Spanish, but you can always tell when someone is talking shit.

After a few weeks of this, one of my better Spanish speaking students comes up to me and says ""Mister, you know he's saying bad words to you in Spanish right?"" At that instant I came up with a plan. I asked my students for some Spanish assistance and waited.

The next time this kid walked by my classroom he started talking shit, as per usual. This time I stopped him. He came over to me trying to look like hot shit. When he got to me I said to him

""Cual es tu nombre?"" (What is your name?"")

His eyes got huge and he stammered out his name. Then I responded

""Puedo Oirte"" (I can hear you)

He started to speak really panicked and rapidly in Spanish. I couldn't understand anything he was saying. According to my students he was apologizing and saying that he was just trying to make new friends and act tough. 

Being as I had no idea what he was saying, I just looked at him and said ""Adios"" and shooed him away.

I haven't seen him this week, so I guess my little scare tactic worked. I still do not speak Spanish.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7whmca/student_says_bad_things_to_me_in_spanish_i_make/,pettyrevenge,667,1.0

2018-02-07 10:41:19+00:00,4977,You want me to stay an hour after close? Sure.... I’ll do that,DarklyNear,"One of the most frustrating things about the warehouse work I used to do was the complete disconnect between the sales staff and the warehouse.

Sales staff would promise the moon and stars to customers to secure a sale, with little to no consideration for what it would do to the warehouse staff.

This would range from promising that we would be  able to load up a product that clearly wouldn’t fit into a vehicle, that we would lift something that would take four guys when we would only have on person staffed, and the worst one... that we would wait for a customer to come back and pick up goods.

After a few months of these ridiculous promises .... I finally went to Management and said that if sales staff expected us to stay past close to assist a customer then we would be billing that time as over time.

Management downright refused, as the company couldn’t “afford” over time.

A few days After that conversation ... I was on the sales floor unpacking a new range of rugs when a sales person approached me with this woman ... who immediately had the I’m better than you atmosphere and perpetual resting bitch face.

I could tell already from this ladies smug smirk that she’s worn down the sales person and made them promise her something that would be against policy.

Sales associate - hey DarklyNear this lady has bought a few rugs from out the back... can she come pick them up later?

Me - sure, you can pick them up between now and 5pm

Lady (smug) - sales person has already said i can come back at 7.30pm and pick them up

Me - well miss, I’ll be here until 5pm... after that the warehouse is closed for the evening. If you’d like I can always help you tomorrow morning...

Lady - I’ll be here at 7.30 and you’d better be here or I’m calling the manager and fucking complaining.

I just gave her a shrug and went back to my work.

Lady - oh, and make sure you clean the rugs before I pick them up.... I’m going to be inspecting them and they’d better be fucking spotless.

She then turned on her heel and walked off.

Bitch you paid $20 a piece for clearance rugs... that originally retailed at $350.

Sales person walked away, assuming all was good. There’s no way I’m waiting two and a half hours for such a condescending crabby bitch.

I grabbed my trolley and made my way back
To the warehouse, passing the clearance area.

As I’m walking I notice a ladies purse sitting amongst a stack of cushions. I walk over and pick it up, before I take it to the counter I have a gut feeling.... can it be?
I open the purse and find a drivers license... it this bitch customers license and purse.

I chuckle to myself as I walk back to the warehouse, make my way into the warehouse office and take extra care to safely secure her purse inside our safe.

I then start my closing up process and as a little extra slice of pettiness type in the all purpose alarm code and re set the alarm system code so only I can unlock the warehouse when I show up for my shift the next morning.

Good luck getting your rugs and purse!!!! 


———

AFTERMATH 

Apparently this lady showed up at 7.30pm only to find
- the gates locked
- everything pitch black
- no rugs

She filed a complaint and wanted a full refund... not for the clearance prices she paid but for the FULL PRICE of the rugs .

When I was questioned about this I provided my manager with the emails from the Gm stating that they don’t pay employees to work any over time.

They also questioned me about the change of alarm system code and I just said that we had a potential security issue, and with this ladies Expensive purse being left instore I figured it’d be best resolved the following morning and kept in a safe and secure spot.

In the end this bitch got her purse back... but I liked to think she wasted a tonne of gas and caused her immense amounts of aggravation...

When the customer did show up to pick her rugs up I also helpfully pointed out it was illegal for her to be driving without a license.

She shot me the most amazing death glare I’ve ever seen. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7vv9bb/you_want_me_to_stay_an_hour_after_close_sure_ill/,pettyrevenge,265,0.0

The very minute the class ended, dozens of students came pouring into the room, not fully comprehending the fact that if they wanted to sit down, they would have to let us get up and leave.

I was gathering my things when a girl slammed her bag and laptop down on my desk. When I looked at her, sort of shocked, she gave me a very snooty look and said, ""I'm sitting here now, you're going to have to move."" I gathered my things and I left.

I heard the asshole girl talking to her friends about the things she's doing to prepare for it.

After the next class, while I was packing up, I had a very loud conversation with my friend sitting next to me about the competition and I have the responsibility to pick people and dictate how the competition is run. I made sure to make eye contact with the girl, who was clearly listening, and I said, ""I already know some people who won't be getting on.""

2018-02-01 16:38:43+00:00,5498,You should really have googled that,verya,"I'm not sure if I'm proud of this yet but my friend told me it might be appreciated by some low-grade sadists here. 

*edit: added a tl;dr*

I have a cousin (""Mack"") whose picture is next to the word *self-righteous* in the dictionary. He's not alone in my extended family - if there's a gene for self-righteousness and pestering other people about their lives, most of my relatives have it once. A few blessed relatives don't have it at all. Mack, though, definitely has BOTH of those self-righteous gene alleles. He's even a pastor (apologies to any pastors, but you probably know the kind of guy I mean). 

**Backstory which may interest some of you, but likely not too many, so skip a bit if you like**

Mack grinds my gears, and though it is not directly relevant to what he did to inspire my petty revenge, readers may be more satisfied with what happens to him if they know a couple of other things about him. 

Mack has made it his personal mission to make sure everyone around him is on the straight and narrow path. While admirable, he has managed to implement good intentions in the most bizarrely ineffective ways possible. His young son with his wife (""Tiffany"") is not allowed to interact with my dad, because my dad is divorced. My dad is also a great person and an interesting guy to be around, but that doesn't matter, because apparently divorce is a nasty communicable disease.

Mack also believes that demons are constantly tempting us, and any deviation from said straight and narrow path is due to their influence. Now, this by itself is alright. We all have our weird beliefs. But he did try to exorcise my other cousin once. Her demon had apparently gotten her to smoke a big fat joint, and as such she was completely unprepared for the experience. There was screaming and tears.

One last thing: Mack and Tiffany, despite their good traits (which will remain unmentioned), are very judgmental and pushy. They have a stringent idea of how one should live and if you deviate from it, prepare for an annoying and self-righteous lecture, a few Bible verses, and possibly an exorcism. It's better than hell, they would say. Not so, I reply.

**Here's the good part**

I don't see Mack and Tiffany very often, but this summer I happened to visit my grandparents while they were in town. I had forgotten what they can be like until we sat down to catch up. They asked me about grad school, and my boyfriend of 6 years. My answers seemed to confuse them in some way. It quickly became apparent that they were leading the conversation in a particular direction. 

First they wanted to know why we weren't married, and if we were living together (in sin, presumably). I parried. They asked why I was in grad school - it was going to take so long, and there are enough scientists anyway, why not just marry and settle down now? I evaded. They asked me when I was planning to have children. Sensing danger, I changed the subject immediately. You see, I'm one of these oddballs who isn't interested in having children. To each their own I say, but not for me. As you might imagine, though, I was not about to tell *them* that without a fight.

They gave me one. Read their comments in a high, whiny voice with a hint of confusion:

""You have to get started soon! You know your eggs start dying when you're like 25!"" 
""It's sooo sad when a young woman doesn't have children, she doesn't know what she's missing!""
""God told us to go forth and multiply - you know it's your duty to him, don't you?"" 

Their words had some sort of effect on me. I'm not sure what it was, but I momentarily lost my senses. I figured they would keep pestering me until they got a response, and I might as well just say it and be done with them. I was out of practice with relatives and my usual trick of pretending to need a bathroom break never crossed my mind. So I took the plunge and told them I'd rather do other things with my life than have a baby. 

I regretted it immediately and had the impression of staring at a shocked and angry bull who is convinced I have just bitten it on the behind. My cousin actually yelled at me. I am a selfish, short-sighted person who doesn't know what it means to be a woman and will die alone. God is disappointed in me. (God can fuck off). I'm a waste of a human, because what's the point of life without children? I will never know love. I'd better change my mind!

Arguments ensued. A wild aunt chimed in to tell me the same things. I don't remember how exactly it ended but as you might imagine, I was miffed.

A couple of days later, I think I've forgotten the whole thing. After all, that's just how Mack is and it isn't personal. But I have omitted one important detail so far: Tiffany was pregnant with their second child. A discussion of potential baby names arose, and I saw an opportunity. An opportunity hinging on the basic assumption that while these people may be annoyingly self-righteous, they are not complete idiots. Though maddeningly pushy, I had no reason to suspect that they were particularly stupid. Spoiler alert, but I may have been wrong.

Anyway, baby names were being discussed. Various relatives made suggestions. They said they liked old-sounding Biblical names, which makes sense because Kid #1 already has a bit of a weird one. I'm not even sure what made me think of it, but I told them I had always liked the name ""Nephron,"" which is the name of an ancient Roman emperor who is known for his piety and for helping bring Christianity to Rome in the early days. I half-expected one of my aunts or maybe my Dad to call me on my bullshit, because they are all Christians and some of them know a bit about early Christian history, but nobody did. Mack asked me how to spell it, and where I knew about it from. The first thing that popped into my mind was ""A book on early Christianity that I read in undergrad"", which earned me a funny look from my dad, the only one in the room who knows I'm not religious. But he said nothing. Eventually Mack and Tiffany thanked me for my suggestion and the discussion moved on. I figured if they were at all interested in naming their kid Nephron they would look it up, figure out I was fucking with them, and either laugh it off or get mad but pick another name.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. I just got an e-mail they sent around to everyone announcing the birth. They are overjoyed, apparently, to welcome ""Abraham Nephron Jackson*"" into the world.

They had not googled it.

They had not done basic research on this name that they were giving their child. (Maybe Mack thinks the Internet is a tool of Satan?)

Nephron is not the name of a pious Roman emperor. It's actually the functional unit of a kidney, suggested in a light rage by someone who was annoyed at Mack for his pushiness. Nephrons filter urine and this kid and his parents are stuck with that for life. 

To anyone thinking I should feel bad: I do. A bit.

Not enough to tell anyone, though.

2018-01-31 17:05:59+00:00,2544,"Mother knows best, yeah okay",fiercelybear,"So I used to work at a fast food place in a mall where based off how many items you choose for your meal that's your total. All of our meats have at least one type of vegetable with them because the franchise wanted people to eat more of them, health, etc. So if you asked for chicken, we have to scoop you some veggies that's in there with it because it's our job and to be fair to other customers otherwise they'd be left with just veggies until the next batch was ready.

Anyway, we have plenty of people that ask for no veggies with their meats but we inform them we have to and tell them the reason why and they're usually understanding. USUALLY. It's stupid but my manager told us that if someone is having a bitch fit just let them have it their way bc it's not worth the hassle. Okay.

This lady comes up to me and I greet her as usual. She orders a meal and asks for chicken. I scoop the chicken with veggies into her box and she speaks up.

Lady: ""Oh, sorry. I don't want any veggies with the chicken.""

Me: tell her the same spiel 

Lady: ""Haha, well it's for my child and he doesn't like them.""

Me: same spiel with an apology

Lady: she's getting visibly annoyed ""He's allergic to these veggies.""

Who is this bitch trying to fool? We take allergies very seriously because we do work with nut oils and I know she was lying to get her way. Don't joke about allergies you don't have bc you ruin it for people who actually do. There's a line forming behind her now, maybe about two people. They all heard her and they looked annoyed too. Commence pettiness.

Me: ""Allergic? Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Would you be interested in these options instead? The veggies are touching the chicken and I don't want to get your child sick.""

Lady: she's surprised and stammers ""Oh no, he uh just can't eat the veggies. Touching is fine.""

Me: thiiiiiiiiiis bitch ""Are you sure? We take allergies very seriously here.""

Lady: looking around kind of panicking ""Yup! I'm sure. I'm his mother.""

I take my sweet ass time picking out veggies from the scoops of chicken and now there's four people behind her. She sees the line and sees me carefully taking out said veggies.

Lady: ""Well, a little bit of veggies is okay!"" clearly trying to get out of there ASAP. 

Me: ""Ma'am, don't worry about it. I'll make sure to take all the veggies out. Allergies are taken seriously here."" 

She has a mixture of panic from making the people behind her wait and annoyance because I'm taking my time. Maybe don't fucking lie about shit like that. 

It was nice too because my co-worker started helping the people behind her so they were obviously trying to get around the lady blocking the front.


Edit: Because I've noticed it's getting quite steamy (steam tables haha I'll show myself out) in the comments. It was a stirfry place in the mall and the veggies were pre-mixed. A comment below gave the good example of beef and broccoli. Our chicken came with green peppers and each scoop has a certain ratio we're supposed to give (end of the employee totem pole don't shoot) so when someone asks for no veggies but expects the same price it's extra but they often argue for it. We also had other trays with just meat and just veggies too (but probably not made with the sauce they wanted). Yes, the company policy is stupid. Yes, people can be allergic to vegetables or certain ones just don't quite sit well with them.

2nd Edit: The trays with just meat were things like chicken balls and chicken wings. All other meats came with veggies automatically cooked with them. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7ubdzh/mother_knows_best_yeah_okay/,pettyrevenge,295,0.0

I started working in a corporate office in a secretarial position for my first job after college.  There were two older ladies who were also secretaries working in the office.   One of them was just fine, but I spent most of my time sitting beside and working with Agnes.   Agnes was quickly approaching retirement age but wasn’t going anywhere without a big push.   This was in the days where we just started getting computers and she was absolutely hopeless.   She’d pull stuff like “I can’t answer the phone - I’m on the computer.”   Multi-tasking was not in this woman’s repertoire.   She was super fussy, and annoying.   If I ever came back from lunch 5 minutes late, she would exclaim loudly “OMG - there you are!   I was wondering what had happened to you!”, making sure the whole office knew I was late.  Meanwhile, she was usually late coming in in the morning, and often left early for various appointments.   If I made a typo in a document, she would make sure the rest of the staff knew about it, loudly.

She tended to pout when when things didn’t go her way, and she would “quit” her job when someone pissed her off, and then my boss’s boss would talk her into staying.   I’d heard about this tactic of hers and one day, our boss did something that annoyed her and she “quit” again.  My boss’s boss was away that day so I had my chance.  I quickly advertised and planned a big retirement party for her.  It was a done deal by the end of the day.   People were dropping by and congratulating her and everyone looked forward to the party.   At that point, I guess she figured it was too late to pull her usual shenanigans and she actually retired.   I told my boss to not bother replacing her because it was damn easy to cover the little work she actually accomplished every day.

2018-01-29 13:49:26+00:00,4309,Police assisted public humiliation,BlueShiftNova,"I was telling my sister this story the other day and she suggested you guys might enjoy it and that I should post so here I am.

This takes place a number of years ago when I was working at a gas station as the assistant manager in not the best part of the city where gas theft was an issue that we had to deal with on a somewhat regular basis. My story revolves around these forms we had if you couldn’t pay for your gas, it was essentially a piece of paper that had the persons contact details, the amount owing, and a promise to come back and pay (we weren’t allowed to take any of their items as “insurance”). If they didn’t come back the worker had to pay for the gas, so really it was up to you if you trusted them and were not obligated to use them.

With that said I was working on a Monday morning and a bunch of people were getting gas on their way to work and I have a small line up of customers. The door opens and this guy walks past the line and says he can’t pay for his gas, so give him one of those forms and he’ll be back at the end of the week to pay it. Now I know of this guy but haven’t encountered him, I have seen his name on previous forms and know that he uses us like a payday loan for gas so I told him flat out that I wasn’t giving him one.

Customer (cs): “Come one, give me one of those forms”
Me: “No, you’re going to have to pay”
Cs: “You have to give me one if I request it”
Me: “I don’t”
Cs:  “Well I have to go to work so if you don’t give me one I’m just going to leave”
Me: “That’s fine, but not with your car”

The conversation goes on like this, I tell him if he goes I’m calling the cops to which he responds with my favorite line, “You gotta do what you gotta do, and I gotta do what I gotta do”. As he’s starting to walk out I look at the next lady in line and excuse myself, she gives me this huge smile and says she has no problem waiting. So I follow the guy out, take a picture of his plate and he drives off. I finish helping the people in line, and call the cops. The police in my city absolutely hate gas theft as it eats up more of their time than it should, so when I tell the dispatcher what happened and what was said she starts laughing and let me know they will take care of it.

Apparently what happened after that call* is the police found out where the guy works so they contacted his office and informed them that they would be coming over looking for the guy. When they got there two officers and the manager walked though the building to his desk, and loudly asked if he had stolen gas earlier that morning so everyone could hear. He had to admit it in front of everyone and he was given two choices, go back now with them and pay for it, or they would be going forward with theft charges, he wisely chose the former. So with a police escort he drove back to my store, and with as few words as possible paid the $20 is gas (Yup, only $20) and left. After that I never saw him in my store or his name on any form ever again.

\* The police officer came back later in my shift to fill up and let me know what went down at the guys work place. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7tsehx/police_assisted_public_humiliation/,pettyrevenge,270,0.0
2018-01-28 13:33:33+00:00,2351,My best friend worked in a machine shop.,TheMeatWhistle45,"It was a fairly small shop with about a dozen guys working there. The boss was an ok guy, but he was rather cheap. He wasn’t really paying the guys what they should be making, but it was the only shop in the area, so most of the guys stayed because of the short commute.

Anyway, a new shop that made the same type of products was opening up in the next town over and they were paying substantially more than the place my buddy worked. Before going for an interview at the new place, my buddy asked for a small raise and was told “no.” About ten out of the 12ish guys got hired at the new shop and had a start date.

Here is the kicker though:

Anytime over the years someone gave a 2 week notice to the old shop, the boss would immediately fire them. It was just a matter of course with this guy, so the guys all put in their notice on Friday and they were already starting the new job on Monday. 

The boss freaked out when he got a stack of resignation letters on Friday night and made an exception to his immediate firing policy. He asked my buddy “would you mind training your replacement for 3 weeks instead of just the standard 2 weeks?”

My buddy and all the other guys said basically “sorry man. You usually fire someone when they give notice and I couldn’t go two weeks without a check, so good luck.” 

The shop was closed for over a month while the guy hustled to find qualified staff and the guy lost a ton of money over it. I guess it pays to keep your employees happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7tk940/my_best_friend_worked_in_a_machine_shop/,pettyrevenge,119,0.0

About a year ago I worked under this chef with a bit of an anger problem. It was no big deal most of the time and for the most part we got along great. But he rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because he had a bit of a temper.

He had this habit of keeping a stack of pans on the back burner of the range with the flame on. This was to cut down on our ticket times because we didn't have to wait for our pans to heat up first, you could just grab one off the top and start cooking your food (sidenote: I hated it because it eventually warped every sauté pan we had, but I've heard this is a thing people do and I don't pay for the pans so, whatever). 

One day I'm making a mac and cheese, which involves a premade cheese sauce (which is already hot on the line) and precooked noodles in a pan. For those who aren't cooks, this does not require a white-hot preheated pan, it's a gentle reheating process unless you want to scorch and ruin your sauce. So I grab a new, cold pan off the top, rather than the ones he's had on the back burner for 30+ mins.

The chef absolutely loses it. Goes red in the face saying, ""I tell you every fucking day not to use cold pans"", ""why can't you just fucking listen"", blah blah blah. Essentially implying I'm stupid and can't follow simple directions. By the end of the day almost every other employee came up to ask if I was ok, giving me hugs, etc. It was nice but at the same time I'm a line cook and he's the chef. I know my place in the kitchen. I simply responded with a ""yes chef, won't happen again"".

Next day I get another mac and cheese and I think ""Yes. This is my moment."" I grab the hottest pan from the bottom of the stack and drop the hot cheese sauce in, all the while knowing he's watching over my shoulder. I leaned back as the sauce burst into flames, instantly breaking into a weird, disgusting combo of curdled-looking cheese and oil. The pan was so hot the macaroni noodles seared and stuck to the pan I was using. I just shrugged, served it up and put it in the window. Chef comes over to it mad as hell, mumbling and grumbling something along the lines of ""we can't serve this shit, make it again."" So I made it my way and it turned out fine.

He stopped preheating the pans after that and not another word was spoken about it ever again. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7ta3qh/my_chef_screamed_at_me_for_not_doing_things_his/,pettyrevenge,216,0.0
2018-01-26 01:12:37+00:00,2120,The kid gets revenge,MissOgletree,"My son told me this tonight...

My kid is almost 10 and has constantly had problems with another kid at school. This other kid is a known bully and constantly talks shit, steals stuff, and has damaged my son (and other kids) property. They've been been in the same class for three years and it's been hell for him all three years with all interactions with this kid. The teacher and principal discipline him, but the crap continues nonetheless. We've talked to the mom, but her stance is ""Boys will be boys...""

My son and another friend who have been picked on by this kid all this time noticed that he was playing a game similar to Minecraft on one of the computers during their down time. They watch him and every time the kid collected a certain amount of materials to build something with (I'm fuzzy on those details), one of them sticks their foot in the middle of the computer cluster, hits the power supply switch to cut it off, making him lose everything. My son said he didn't know who was doing it, how I don't know.

Yesterday, they flipped the switch again and this time the kid got so pissed off that he smashed his keyboard over the monitor. Got sent to the principal's office and suspended a day for destroying school property.

2018-01-24 18:58:33+00:00,4707,"A guy in high school told me he was going to rape me, and I called him out in class when we were in college.",cassidy-alexis,"So this happened a few years ago.

In high school, when I was either a junior or senior, I got a message from a friend's boyfriend asking me to hang out etc etc. I told him I found it inappropriate he was asking me that due to the fact that he was dating my friend, and he was asking me inappropriate questions. At one point I flat out told him we weren't having sex (I was a virgin at the time, which he knew I'm assuming my friend told him), and he responded with things like ""Oh don't worry, you're gonna like it."" ""I promise to be somewhat gentle, it's going to happen."" ""You'll like it."" 
I told my friend, they broke up, he blew up on me, I blocked him. 

Fast forward  to my freshman year in college, my first class (public speaking) on my first day, and he is one of the first people I see. I don't know what he told his friend when he saw me, but they were looking at me as he was whispering, and his friend loudly went ""Oh, this is going to be fun.""  

I avoided talking to them, making eye contact, and I would be the first one out of class. They mostly didn't talk to me or make any contact besides a few looks or snickers here or there. 

So for public speaking, we had an assignment where we could make a speech about literally any topic we chose (it was supposed to be an informative speech). So I chose to do a speech on sexual harassment and rape culture. I did this to be petty, but also because it's something that I'm passionate about and that interests me. He's not the first run in I've had when it comes to sexual harassment. 

I'm a very confident speaker, I love speaking in front of crowds. I really love to entertain (if anyone knows a good career field I can go into please let a girl know.) Going up, I had my speech prepared, and it was very informative and entertaining, I got the whole class involved. 

Now I did this speech intending to be petty, I knew he knew I was throwing shade. Then I decided to make it a little more intense. I was using people in the class as examples and asking people in our class questions, so I decided to call him out. 

""Let's say ""Jason"" here messaged me asking to sleep with me, and I said no."" 
The moment I said his name, he went completely pale. He didn't even blink or move, just stared at me. 
""Now I said no, and I made it clear I said no. Then he continued to say it didn't matter, because I was going to like it. This is a problem because a, b, and c."" 

Then I basically dug into how much of an asshole he was, and people were making comments on how horrible it would be for someone to say that, that it's absolutely disgusting. 

The look on his face was so priceless, that alone gave me so much satisfaction. Getting an A on the speech seemed just like cherry on top of the cake at that point. 

TL;DR: 
Dude said he was going to rape me in high school. I made a speech in the class I had with him calling him out on how gross he was, and got an A. 



-UPDATE-
Hi all! I'm very overwhelmed with all the support and kind words and all the encouragement I've been receiving!! I was trying to reply to all of the comments but I don't think I have the time or the attention span!! 

So A LOT of these comments are asking ""Exactly when did he say he would rape you?"" 
I mentioned in a response that what I wrote here wasn't all that was said to me. I didn't want to say them, I didn't feel the need to. He made it clear what his intentions were if we were to be anywhere near each other. 

Also, I genuinely think this is petty revenge! A lot of people have been saying its pro, but I'm an extremely petty person, I'm very passive aggressive. I feel like maybe if I had told my professor, or pulled up the screenshots, I would've. Truthfully I don't think I had the screenshots anymore at that point. If I recall correctly I think not only deleted my facebook, but also changed phones and deleted photos for memory purposes. I don't know what exactly the reason was, but I don't think I had them.

-UPDATE PART 2 (after reading more comments)-
I truly don't mean to offend anyone, I'm not trying to downplay the word rape. Again-he said a lot more than this. He did say ""you won't have to say yes"", and things of that nature. Again, it's just uncomfortable to me to talk about or explain. If people really find this post offensive I'll take it down!! I'm not trying to upset anyone.

2018-01-24 05:13:51+00:00,7101,Want Us to Carry the Project? Have Fun Getting Embarrassed in Class!,cheap_peep,"Final year of University, I’m in a Literature class I really need to pass with flying colors. The time comes to do group projects, and imagine my dismay when the girl I affectionately refer to as Airhead, is in our group. 

Airhead spent most of her tutorial lessons on her laptop adding clothes to her wish list, and whenever questioned about something, would say “Ummm, I don’t know?” In a very cutesy way to suggest she could get off the hook. When we did writing homework, she copy and pasted hers from fanfiction websites. We get given quite a big book to study, and I’m very sure Airhead isn’t going to read it. In our group meeting she pretty much says ‘UMmm I’m terrible at group stuff- I’m gonna let you lead and do a lot of the creative work! Just let me do what the book’s definition is, and you can talk about the themes!’ 

I know Airhead is going to just get a synopsis of the book from somewhere, and sure enough, when she sends through the details, it matches to a book review on the first result of Google- nothing changed. 

Feeling petty because I need those grades and worked damn hard, I hit up my English tutor who had been starting to lump me and Airhead together, assuming I was also lazy. I let him know that Airhead was using stolen material, hadn’t read the book at all, and could me and my other group members be marked separately. Delightedly, he agreed. 

The day of the presentation Airhead introduces the book and my teacher listens to her massively stolen speech. Afterwards, just before she passes the info on to me, he suddenly begins to quiz her on the book. On the messages. On the theme. On the side characters. Watching her face change as she at first looked to me to answer it and then the teacher looked to her to make sure she was answering it was priceless. Airhead later lamented to me she had no idea why she failed the class when the rest of us passed.

(He and I have broken up since thank god.) It was supposed to be mutually beneficial but turned into me and my sons grandfather being the only people working and paying bills in the house. 

My ex's mother hated me. She didn't really have a reason to. She just hated any woman that she thought ""showed her up."" Which wasn't really hard since her main job was holding down the couch most of the day to make sure it didn't run away. 

I turned a blind eye to all the shit she talked about me and blamed me for. But one day she took it too far. 

It was my moms 60th birthday. Her friends planned to take her out to eat then to a neighborhood bar for a couple of drinks. They invited me along. 

The morning of her birthday I put on some nicer makeup and clothes then I usually do for work. It was a nicer restaurant and I wanted to look appropriate. I was gone for about 2 hours. When I came home I walked past her and she called me a whore. That was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I was pissed. I quietly plotted my revenge. Pretended everything was fine for about 2 weeks until I had a chance to put my plan into place. 

She had all day plans on a Saturday. And for once I was all alone in the house. She was a larger woman so she really didn't have too many clothes that actually fit and that she would wear. 

I went into her closet. I even took photos of where the clothes were hung and how they were placed. Then I took all those clothes and put them in the washer on the sanitize setting. 

If you don't know the sanitize setting is water that gets up to 220 degrees. Which will shrink just about anything. 

I made sure to dry them on the hottest setting too. Then I very carefully hung them back up exactly as they were using my photos for guidance. 

The next day was glorious. She went to get dressed and absolutely nothing fit. She had a meltdown in her room. Calling her family bawling about how she didn't understand how she could have gained so much weight in a week. (She refused to have a scale in the house. She just went by how her clothes fit.) 

The next few days of watching her pull and tug at her clothes always brought a smile to my lips. I don't know if she ever bought new clothes. I broke up with her son shortly after and never looked back.

My brother was a regular at a nearby pub and had gone in as usual one Friday evening for a few pints. In comes this group of lads about 18-19 years old, so just of legal drinking age in the UK.
After a few drinks, one of the lads decides he wants to try and impress his mates by badmouthing the establishment in front of the landlady.

When the landlady was in earshot he’d come out with things like “Why did we even bother coming here lads? This pub is shit,” which would get a couple of sympathy laughs, but not the attention he was hoping for, so he kept going.

After a few times the landlady started to get pretty annoyed, and finally after the guy mentions how shit the pub is again she turned to him and said “If my pub is so shit, then you can leave. In fact, you’re barred, so get out.”

With an arrogant smirk on his face he says “right, come on then lads; let’s get out of this dump.”

At this point, the landlady smiles and says “Oh no. Your *friends* aren’t barred, they’re more than welcome. In fact, I’m giving them a round on the house. But you need to get out of my pub.”

What these assholes failed to realize is that my coworker ran a grain farm with his dad and brother for 30-odd years just outside the city. When he saw the pile of snow in his driveway he sat there fuming as he smoked a cigarette and finished his XL coffee, then turned around and drove to the family farm, picked up their tractor with bucket, and drove an hour back to his house in the suburbs at a top speed of 30 km/h. 

He pushed all that snow right back into the parking lot where it came from, and made sure to spread it around in the process. Then he took the tractor back to the farm, drove home, parked in his driveway, and settled in to a good night's sleep.

It took him 4 hours altogether, but he says it was worth it to see the contractors back the next day clearing the lot again and hauling away the snow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7qq0h5/dont_piss_off_a_farmer/,pettyrevenge,112,0.0

2018-01-12 16:39:14+00:00,2281,Gummy package,Pokeymonkey,"I flew from O'Hare to Newark. The flight was full and one lady sat behind me was on the phone loudly. She yelled at the old man who sat next to her for coughing. “If you’re sick, you should have canceled your trip.” Then she turned her attention to whomever on her phone. “Speak louder. I can’t hear a word you said. The whole freaking plane is full of sick peopl.” Then she shoved her bag under the seat in front of her (my seat) so forceful it came out from underneath me. I turned to face her and she shot me a look of disdain. I told her about the bag encroaching into my space and she ignored me so I kicked it back under the seat with my heels. “Watch it buddy,” she croaked. “You break my iPad I’ll take you to small claim court.” “Keep your bag in your area,” I said to her. 

The old man continued to cough. He couldn’t help himself. There was no other place for the flight attendants to switch him. To the right a few seats down, a baby cried incessantly. The woman got off her call and said loudly to no one in particular, “JFC, can someone shut that baby up?” The stewardess came over and whispered something in her ear, which settled her down a bit. 

A few minutes later the plane took off. Her bag once again was shoved against my heels. At this point we were playing some kind of “passing the bag” game, back and forth in between us. After awhile she won. Or so she thought. 

I leaned back as far as I could. Between the baby crying, the old man coughing, and that woman’s loud complaints, I had about enough. “You took my arm seat,” she said to the old man. “I can’t help it if your arms are too fat,” he retorted in between his coughing fits. Back and forth, back and forth, a thought entered my head - -  a bad one. 

I reached in my pocket and retrieved my pack of gum. One by one I chewed them until they were drained of the sugary taste. Then I wedged them under the lid of her bag. As the flight progressed, I got more creative. The sticky gum were accompanying with little notes I tore out from the airline magazine. “Drop dead,” said one. “Jerk” said the other. There were more notes but I didn’t remember what the messages were. 

As the plane landed, I was the first one got off. I wonder how long it took for her to discover what I did. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7pxrjh/gummy_package/,pettyrevenge,72,0.0

I got in my car to pick up my girlfriend and my tire pressure light came on.  I have a 12v air compressor in my backseat but it’s loud and fills sort of slowly, so I opted to drive to the local wawa.  (For those who don’t have Wawa, it’s like if 7/11 got sober and went to college.)  Wawa’s air pumps are free to use which usually means there are at least a few cars lined up, but when I pulled in there was only one other car.  Score.  I pulled behind the guy filling his tires and an older gentleman in a BMW pulled in behind me.  After about 3 minutes a woman in a brand new Lexus pulls up directly next to me and puts her window down.  “I only have to fill one tire, do you mind if I go in front of you?”, she asked.  I said, “Actually I do, we’ve been waiting here for a little bit, sorry.”  She muttered something while rolling her window up and I put up mine.  About a minute later the guy at the pump was done. He backs up and before I can even put my car in gear Lexus woman pulls her car in front of mine diagonally, blocking me from pulling into the spot, and then pulls straight in after th first guy has moved.  She climbs out of her car and gives me the MOST INFURIATING little wave.  At this point my anger gives way to a ninja-like calm, and I know exactly what must be done.  I pull my car forward and stop ~6 inches from her rear bumper.  The air pump is in the corner of the lot, so Lexus woman has a curb in front of her, a curb to her right (where the pump is), an open spot to her left, and now my dirty ass car right behind her brand new one.  She is busy filling her tire and doesn’t notice that I’ve pulled right up to her car.  I step out of my car, grab my air compressor from the back seat and start setting it up to fill my tire.  Mr. BMW, who has remained completely still and silent, sees what I’m doing and asks if I can fill his tires too.  I say “of course” and motion for him to park in the empty spot to Lexuslady’s left.  As soon as he pulls in she notices what’s happening and starts yelling.  I flip on my air compressor and begin filling my tire, her cries drowned out by the sound of 250psi of justice.  She comes
and stands in front of me, face beet red and little flecks of spittle popping out from between her cigarette teeth as she calls me all sorts of names.  I calmly say “Ma’am, I only have one tire to fill.  You don’t mind, do you?”.  Mr. BMW is absolutely loving this, and as I finish my tire and move to fill his she starts up again. “You motherfuckers, fucking piece of shit assholes etc.”.  I finish Mr. BMW’s tire and he thanks me for my help, climbs in his car and pulls away grinning.  I wrap my compressor up nicely, pick a good song, and set my climate control to a balmy 82 degrees, all while Lexus lady is trapped in front of me.  I calmly back up, give her a little wave, and drive off into the night.  

tldr lady takes my spot at the air pump, I block her in and fill my tire and the gentleman behind me with my own very slow, very loud compressor. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7po52h/dont_want_to_wait_your_turn_now_you_wait_ten/,pettyrevenge,527,0.0

My job at said grocery store was in the bakery and one of my duties was to get the frozen bread from the back freezer and stock the shelves. One early morning at 6 am a Grouchy Asshat(GA for short) comes up and lets me know that he ordered a certain type of bread a few days ago and that it should be in today. I hadn't seen it in the back freezer, but I go back there and check anyways. I don't see it at first and I search for the next 15 minutes and still don't find it. It is simply not there. Sometimes other departments would grab our pallets on accident so I decide to double check the system. It turns out that although the bread was order, the factory messed up and didn't send any of it. I let GA know what was up and that it should be in the next day, and he just starts yelling.

""I need this bread, we use it for our french toast in xxxx restaurant that I own, you're an incapable bitch, blah blah blah, no  wonder you work in a grocery store, you're never going anywhere with your life!!!"" 

And then he stormed off

I let it go because I understand running a business is tough and I have better things to do. We get the bread in the next day, a co-worker calls him to let him know it's ready for pickup (side note, he doesn't get it until a week after we call him). Also on this day the store manager comes to me with a scathing review made about me, obviously made from GA detailing how horrible of a worker I am. Luckily, this store manager knows me, knows that I am a hard worker, and believed that this guy was a little unhinged. It also didn't hurt that my whole department spoke up for me in this instance. I was let off with a warning by the store manager; however, I was pissed. This man had tried to get me fired, or at the very least in huge trouble at the place I worked and made my lively hood. It was time for some revenge

When I got off of work, around 9 am I walked a mile out of my way just to walk in front of GA's restaurant that just got busy with many tourists wanting to have breakfast. I pulled out my phone as I was walking by and loudly said ""Yeah, I'm almost there, I'm right outside XXXX. I don't understand why people go there with all the rats they have, especially since [other breakfast place] is right down the street,"" and I kept walking. When I got down the street I turned around and saw a few of the people that were lined up outside of XXXX were now going into the other breakfast place to make reservations. I was gleeful.

It didn't stop there. I walked by that resturant and pulled the same pretty much every day I worked. Sometimes I used the rat line, sometimes I would change it up with cockroaches, really, anything worked. I got my friends in on it. If they walked by they would pretend they were talking in their phone too. Sometimes we would talk how disgusting xxxx resturant was while getting breakfast at the other place down the street.

2018-01-10 05:41:03+00:00,3384,Wanna be loud and rude while shopping? Don't stand behind me in line then.,furion13,"So this happened around the holidays this past year. I went to the store to pick up some wrapping paper and a few other things. Once inside I saw that the store was crowded, and there was only one cashier working, so I anticipated a long line and took my time picking out my things. While perusing the store I noticed one particularly agitated man talking loudly on the phone and power walking through the aisles with little to no regard for other shoppers. He bumped into a few without apology or blatantly stood either close or in front of other people to get the things he needed. He did this to me as well, walking directly in front of me causing me to actually take a step back to avoid getting stomped on. All while speaking loudly on the phone about things he would purchase, business, etc., so you can imagine my displeasure in finding this man in line directly behind me. 
Now a side note here about me- I value my personal space. REALLY value it. 
This man is still speaking loudly into his phone, and is standing uncomfortably close to me as if pushing me forward closer to the person in front of me will speed up the line. This is incredibly irritating to me to say the least. So, I being to widen my stance and rock back and forth a little hoping he will get the message to back off. Nothing. Still way too close, and he is irritated about the long line. At this point I realize that the two tubes of wrapping paper would make an excellent tool. I casually being to play with them, swinging them around a little in waiting. Then I put them quickly over my shoulder as if adjusting my position for the things I'm holding and BAM they go right into mister angry man's face. He didn't stand so close after that. :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7pdjmi/wanna_be_loud_and_rude_while_shopping_dont_stand/,pettyrevenge,235,0.0

I’ve been really into this Nextdoor app since I moved to this new neighborhood. There’s always drama going on which keeps me entertained throughout the day. Recently, I’ve been seeing a lot of sales posts from my neighbors. Recently, One of my lovely neighbors posts a particular ad titled exactly, “GET RID OF YOUR CABLE!!!!!!!!”. Now, most of these ads on this app are complete and utter shit, so I prepare for a laugh and click the thread. 


This guy is selling an android box plus a lifetime subscription to a kodi addon. Now, if you know about kodi and it’s legality, you know it’s basically a gray zone because all you’re doing is streaming the content, not downloading. I’m cool with the streaming part but what I’m not cool with is the price and dishonesty. He’s charging $350 for the product and install.... he is also not disclosing the fact that this is a questionably legal product that won’t stay legal for long. So some of my more not so tech savvy neighbors start asking questions about it( one actually asked if this price included WiFi ). So I add a very nice and formal reply to the thread stating that what the product is doing, where to get the FREE software, how to install it, etc. because what the software is basically doing is stealing these streams from legit companies like hbo, nbc, etc. 


So Mr. Seller responded that he would sue me for slandering his company and product.


Okay... if you’re going to threaten me with that then I’ll just go ahead and compete with you. So I started offering similar specd boxes with pre installed kodi addons which are free. The cost of the boxes are $56 shipped and I sell them plus install for $56... I don’t believe in selling something for 4-5 times the cost. 


It’s been about 2 weeks and I’ve been very busy with installs. I’ve also received plenty of messages from his account and his ‘wife(who probably married him to move to this country)’ about how shitty of a person I am and that they will sue me. Okay man!!! Sick your lawyer on me, let’s see how this goes down!!!

2018-01-04 01:37:41+00:00,6034,My Guard Unit Got Activated after 9/11,TheMeatWhistle45,"Not for anything heroic, but to work as security at the checkpoints of an Army base I won’t name. We basically worked the checkpoints (gates) where cars drive into the base and checked ID cards, did random vehicle searches, crap like that.

It was a horrible job that was made worse by the fact that everyone and their mother was in a shit mood by the time they got to us. There was so much activity on the base because it was a mobilization center for Guard and reserve units getting set to deploy overseas and a TON of units were getting mobilized.  

All the people coming in complained because it took them close to two hours from hitting the end of the line until they got to us at the entrance. I understood their frustration, but it wasn’t my fault. I even bent the rules frequently just to speed things along.

Anyway, I was a Corporal, which is pretty low in the military. Nobody that had any significant rank got stuck with gate duty. So I had to take shit from every frustrated asshole that drive in and was looking to take out their anger on someone.  I had to take endless amounts of shit every day for 8 hours with a smile and a “yes sir”. It was truly a thankless and demeaning job.

So, one of the few ways we had to strike back at the assholes was if they asked for directions. Probably 3 out of 5 did because they were all new to the base and usually only stayed for a couple months tops before shipping out. 

If they were assholes to us and then had the gall to ask for directions, we would tell them this: “go a half mile up the road and take your first turn off of the traffic circle.”

Now the thing is that if they followed those directions, they would find themselves exiting the base from a different checkpoint. Once they made that turn, it was the point of no return. The event horizon. There were Jersey barriers on both sides and NOWHERE to turn around. 

It was a straight road where they would have to drive about a mile and try to get into the line of traffic entering the base from that direction.  They would have to wait in line again and deal with the whole mess one more time. I pretty much stole an hour or two of their lives for being an asshole to me. 

I got called on it by my chain of command a couple times, but just denied giving them the wrong directions. I never got in trouble for it. No matter how high your rank, always treat the little guy with respect or he will find a way to fuck you over. 

Thanks for reading!

EDIT: I should clarify that we only did this to extreme cases where the “victim” was a gigantic, gaping asshole. Like when anyone besides a lower ranking soldier or a retail employee would push their teeth in for them.

My grandma told me this story a few years ago. My dad was the oldest out of 3 kids, and apparently there were some complications at the hospital which racked up a pretty hefty medical bill. Well, my grandparents were going through a rough time financially and just couldn't pay those bills at that moment. The bill collectors didn't really care though, and kept calling and hounding my grandmother at all times of the day and night trying to get her to pay the bills.
 After several weeks of her telling them patiently every single time they called that as soon as she came into a little money she would start paying them, (she DID eventually too) she got a little bit irate. Fast forward to about a month after my dad was born. He's screaming his head off and just won't calm down for anything. Who should call right at that moment? Correct... the bill collectors. Understandably, my grandma is pretty fed up at this point and as soon as the collector finisher his/her spiel my grandma simply yelled ""DO YOU HEAR THIS???"" and held the phone next to my screaming dad. ""REPOSSESS IT!!!"" and hung up. She never was bothered by the collectors again, but she still paid the debt off when they weren't hurting so much financially.

2018-01-01 19:28:53+00:00,2986,So you feel you were cheated out of fifteen minutes? Let me fix that.,nightmuzak,"Years ago, my grandfather's cleaning lady either quit or died, I forget which, and he was left all helpless and dirty because in his day, the women cleaned and the men went out and did the real work. (He was retired by this time.) We lived in Bumfuck, NO, so it wasn't easy to find someone to clean. I graciously offered to help save him from wallowing in his own feces.

…I exaggerate. He actually wasn't a naturally messy person, so it wasn't a terrible job. He had been paying the old cleaner $20 for two hours, and I lived about 25 miles away, so this wasn't exactly a cash cow for me. I tried to arrange things so that I got errands done on cleaning days or visited other family so that the trip wouldn't be a total waste. But mostly it was just that I don't mind cleaning and wanted to help him out.

It's semi-important to the story that my grandfather was pretty well off—when he died, I believe the estate before taxes was about $1.5 million. He'd burn money like crazy on certain things, e.g. he had three cars/trucks and would trade in the oldest every year, and had a ton of expensive toys—but he'd drive 10 miles to a gas station that was $0.02 cheaper per gallon, or ""forget his wallet"" if you met him for lunch, so I guess in the end he considered himself quite frugal.

Anyone who's cleaned for money knows that over time, as you establish a routine and work out best practices, the job takes a lot less time to complete. It took me three hours the first time, and he was there to see it, but only paid the two hours' rate he'd been used to with the other person. Whatever, soon I was down to like an hour and a half, and kind of worked out a rotation of ""extra"" projects he never asked for, like Mr. Clean Eraser-ing the fridge (which apparently was white under all the cigarette smoke residue), emptying cabinets and cleaning the shelves, etc.

He was usually gone the whole time I was cleaning, either his bible study or various old-person pursuits. But he did come home a few times that I'd stayed really late, so he was aware that staying late was a thing. Once every *very* so often, I'd finish up about ten or fifteen minutes early and it didn't make sense to start a new project because I had to be somewhere and couldn't go over time. I think this happened, like, four times in three years.

So. One day he was home *the whole time,* which was really a drag since I like to zone out and play music while I work. Time passed like frozen molasses that day. It got to be about quarter of the time I was supposed to leave and I was done, mostly because there were a couple of things I started to do only to have him say, ""Eh, don't bother with that this week."" And it was one of those weeks where I couldn't stay late, so I couldn't start a new project. So I packed up my stuff and left at about ten til.

He would always leave the $20 on the table, so I was already paid. But the next week, there was only $17, plus fifty cents *in dimes*. So, after telling me not to do some of my regular chores that would have brought me up to the hour, knowing how far I drive to get there, *knowing I stayed late a lot to get extra stuff done for no extra money,* and finally knowing that by the time I'd put everything away it was ten til instead of quarter of, he decides he was cheated out of 15 minutes and withheld accordingly.

I was pissed. Like, seriously pissed. There was a whole history with him and his weird economies, not the worst of which was the ""forgetting his wallet"" thing, and yet because he was my grandfather I'd always looked the other way and tried to do nice things for him. Back then I was a lot nicer, or dumber, not sure which.

I guarantee that that was the last time I ever stayed so much as one minute over the hour, though. There were no extra projects. If I finished the usual chores early, I'd sit and watch the clock. This was long before cell phones had internet, so I would usually bring a book. If he happened to be there, I'd move as slowly as possible and polish the absolute shit out of everything in my path so it took ten times as long.

But that's more malicious compliance. The petty revenge was that, the next visit after the one where I found the shorted pay waiting for me, I left 15 minutes early…after setting every clock in the house ahead 15 minutes.

And when I say every clock? I mean every. Fucking. Clock.

Alarm clock? Check. Grandfather clock? Check. VCR? Check. TV? Big CRT TV where the system clock was five menus deep in white Nintendo font? Check. Stove? Check. Anniversary clock? Check. Watch that he left on the dresser? Check. Silver fish novelty clock in spare room? Check. Cuckoo clock? Check. Clock attached to outside thermometer? Check. Little snowman clock mixed in with all the crap in the curio cabinet? Check. He didn't have a computer or I'd have changed that, too.
He was home again for whatever reason, so I had to be pretty sneaky. I even changed the clocks in his cars (he never locked them since they were in a garage) when I went to take the garbage out.

He was early to whatever old-person activity he'd scheduled for that day, and was complaining that every clock he owned was wrong. I really don't think he suspected, not because he didn't have a massive persecution complex (he did), but because I am female and I honestly don't think he believed I knew how to work all that fancy machinery.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7nh0ef/so_you_feel_you_were_cheated_out_of_fifteen/,pettyrevenge,167,0.0
2017-12-31 21:53:13+00:00,3910,"No more maximum volume movies for you, mate",IlexAquafolium,"This has just happened and I'm still buzzing from it. I moved in to this flat (apartment for y'all 'muricans) in October. The very first evening, a sudden wall of noise engulfs the entire building. The neighbours are watching a film on full blast. I can hear it as clear as day. I can make out every word of this Fast and Furious instalment. It's not the most compelling dialogue I've ever heard, but the revving cars really do speak for themselves. It's frustrating, but I'm not about to kill anyone's buzz. I had recently acquired a nice pair of noise-cancelling bluetooth headphones, so I popped them on and watched my own garbage entertainment on my own TV. 

The next night, the same thing happens. Four or five nights a week these people crank the volume up to 11 and settle in for a night of noise. One evening I snapped, and left a note outside their door. Within a few minutes my engrained fear of confrontation (I'm from England, strangers are our kryptonite) overtook me and I destroyed the note. A few weeks later I had reached breaking point. I penned a savage message, and slid it under their door. I reminded them that other people live in the building, and implored them to have some respect. I felt that surge of adrenaline one experiences when the doorbell rings at 11pm or somebody speaks to you on the street. I couldn't take it back. I closed my front door with the silent speed of a barn owl in flight. My heart was pounding. I turned off the hall light and resumed my intake of visual crack when I could no longer hear my own pulse.

Later, I visited the toilet. I immediately noticed the note. My neighbour had put it under my door. It was at this point I had my epiphany. I was in the clear. If Señor Soundwave ever confronted me about the note, I could play dumb and put him off the scent. A few weeks ago, the fateful moment arrived. On the way out of my front door, I locked eyes with Lord Loud himself. ""Has the noise been any better?"" He inquired. I forced my face to remain blank. ""You put a note under our door, didn't you?"" It was my line. I feigned shock. ""What? Someone put a note under *my* door!"" It was Dr. Decibel's turn to look shocked. I continued. ""I thought it was from the people upstairs. I think they have kids, and I sometimes watch TV pretty late at night."" The kids part is true. I hear those tiny bastards running around quite often, but I'm not going to stoop so low as to ask children to stop playing. Give me 10 years and I'll be there.

Reverend Ruckus thought on this for a second. ""Well, I guess it must have been them. Sorry about that. Have you heard much noise from us?"" I replied with a strategic piece of truth. ""Not really. My bedroom's all the way at the back of the flat."" I pointed away from him to emphasise this point. My trickery was successful. He went inside, and when I returned home with my food I heard nothing. It was quiet from the night of the note. But the story did not conclude until this very evening.

It seems Captain Commotion got a fancy new TV for Christmas. His fingers must have been itching to touch that volume dial. The blaring sound returned. I decided to leave it, and just don my headphones again. In my bluetooth settings, I saw a new device with which to pair. You've guessed it - Sergeant Speakers' TV. I clicked it, and silence fell. I began to perspire with delight. The headphones didn't connect, but I'm guessing a prompt appeared on the TV screen, pausing the film. Within a few seconds, the soundtrack kicked back in. Click, silence, sound. Click, silence, sound. Click. Long silence. Barely audible sound. If smiles made noise, he would have been deafened. I am overjoyed. I'll let him crank his volume once in a while, but I know exactly what to do if he starts pushing his luck.

TL;DR - I am a petty loser who doesn't want the neighbours to have more fun than me.

Edit - For those calling me a 'pussy' and telling me to 'be an adult' about the issue, may I please refer you to the name of the sub. 

Edit 2 - True TL;DR - I stopped the neighbour's loud TV with my bluetooth headphones. Happy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7nb9kr/no_more_maximum_volume_movies_for_you_mate/,pettyrevenge,199,0.0
2017-12-30 18:12:11+00:00,3010,Steal Electricity? Good luck getting home!,nickmerulla,"So let me begin by saying, this is a story of revenge on the part of our strip mall's landlord. A little backstory first. I work for a company that is part of a small strip mall. Located in the strip mall to our immediate left is a Pho restaurant and to the right we have a dental office. Located on the rear of the building between us and the dental office is a maintenance room for the building. Each store manager has a key to this room. Here's the problem:

The Pho place moved in back in May or so, and since day 1 the manager has been plugging his Nissan [Leaf](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4092/5050935331_0205049817_b.jpg) into an outlet in the maintenance room to charge. The car only has a range of about 90 miles and he drives over an hour to work so he has to charge it during the day. This wouldn't be a problem if he was using the electricity they pay for, but he isn't. This has gone mostly unnoticed by our landlord because she's rarely around. That is, however, until last night. To plug his car in, the Pho manager had to prop open the door to the maintenance room, and in Iowa, our winters can get fairly brisk. For instance, today the wind chill is a balmy -20. Some equipment in the maintenance room is temperature controlled and last night the temperature dipped below the acceptable threshold. When our landlord made here way here, however, the car was gone and the door closed. So  when she received another temperature warning this morning, she decided to come back. 

Mr. Pho Manager parks his car directly outside our back door so the cord can reach to the maintenance room. So naturally my day begins with our landlord pounding on our back door and demanding to know who the car belongs to. I kindly informed her that it belongs to the manager of the Pho restaurant. When asked why nobody had mentioned it to her I told her I had just assumed she had approved it. I was told in no uncertain terms that she had NOT. She then proceeded to ask one of my associates how long this had been going on to which he responded it had been occurring since they set up shop in May. As you can imagine, she was less than thrilled with this news. She proceeded to thank us for our time and storm toward the Pho restaurant. Now for the revenge.

Our landlord proceeded to call me after approximately 20 minutes to inform me she had spoken with the Pho employees and manager and nobody seemed to remember who drove the car. To solve to problem she came up with a simple solution and unfortunately for them, her pettiness levels are over 9,000. She took their maintenance room key back and proceeded to unplug the charger from his car, finally locking it in her maintenance room. She was kind enough to leave a note telling the owner if they would like to get home, to give her a call. 

The best part is, since the car takes approximately 8 hours for a full charge, Pho Manager plugs it in all day. But since it had been unplugged less than an hour after being plugged in, when he goes to leave this evening, he'll not only have to call her to get his charger back, but will have to wait the remaining 7 hours or so for an adequate charge to get home. 

Hope he didn't have plans!

Edit: Will keep everyone updated as more unfolds!

Edit 2: UPDATE! He (Pho manager) knocked on our back door and asked if he could borrow our key to the maintenance room. Told him, ""*landlord came by and said she was taking everyone's. Not sure what that was all about, but I don't think anybody has one anymore. Do you want her number?""

2017-12-29 15:39:08+00:00,4119,Think I can't understand you? Thanks for the seat!,Greggybread,"For background: My degree was in Mandarin and I'd learned it for 5 years by the time of this revenge. Unless you look Asian, most Chinese people never expect that you could speak Mandarin, as was the case on this particular day.

This happened a few years ago as I was on the plane waiting for it to take off. 

It was a big plane with the 3 - 4 - 3 seat structure, and I was sat in the right-middle seat of the central section. I'd been sat there for about 20 minutes and nobody had sat down by me yet, so I was getting excited that I would be able to have the row to myself. Sadly it was not to be. A team of Chinese university basketball players get on the plane wearing identical tracksuits and one of them sits by me. Oh well, my 4 seat dream is gone but never mind.

""Don't you guys think lao wai* (*Mandarin for gringo/farang/foreigner. See full definition below*) smell like lamb kebabs?"" says the guy as his teammates snicker. Let's call him OT, for obnoxious twat. My ears prick up at this point and I'm a little bit annoyed. 

""You should be careful talking like that"" says a middle aged man who I assume is their coach. I start to feel a bit better - he's giving the guy a warning... but nope. 

""some lao wai can understand Mandarin.""

An obnoxious little git making fun of me to my right, and a coach who thinks it's completely fine sat in front. Now I'm really starting to get annoyed.

Another minute or two passes and OT mouths off again. ""Hey, have you ever noticed how lao wai always take their shoes off on flights?""

*'Right.'* I think *'Well I'm definitely taking mine off then.'* 

I start unlacing my shoes and just as I take the first one off OT excitedly says ""Guys! The lao wai next to me is taking his shoes off right now! Just like I said!""

I sit back up, give this guy my best death stare and say to him in Chinese ""'What did you say?"" Cue a look of sheer panic on OT's face. Without a word, he stands up and finds another seat, leaving me the entire 4 seat section to myself for the whole flight. That'll serve you right for talking shit about people you don't think can understand you!

EDIT - Differing opinions on definition of the word lao wai.

*Lao wai is not necessarily derogatory. It depends on context, however it is almost ALWAYS used when something bad is being said about you instead of other words for foreigner. As a foreign resident of China for 8 years and a learner of Mandarin for 10, this is my interpretation as somebody who this word has been used against multiple times. Some people don't agree.

Her mother is generally very nice and tends to have a great attitude and be very enjoyable, a bit of a prude but generally enjoyable, however can be a bit of a major snoop. If my wife leaves her phone sitting around she will just pick it up and start going through it. My wife has kind of laughed this off as a remnant of her mom being controlling when she was a kid. 

I'm not a fan of this because my wife and I will sometimes text about thing that simply don't involve her mother and I don't feel are hee business at all.

I sent this text from the bathroom. And maybe it was my imagination but I could swear I could hear an audible ghasp shortly after her phone went off.

When I went out her mother absolutely would not look me in the eye. Then not-so-discreetly asked her daughter to come talk to her in the other room. 

When my wife came back into the living room I thought she had been crying, however upon closer inspection she was laughing. Her mother had questioned her about me sexually abusing her and if I always talk down to her like that.

Enjoy a decidedly non-vegan meal when you get home.",jewyouevenlift,"I never really believed in the stereotype of the condescending, holier-than-thou vegan. I figured it was an invention of omnivores that like to make fun of vegans and project some kind of judgmental attitude on them. And then I met her. She came into this really solid Asian fusion restaurant that does carry-out. She was talking to her friend, and the gist of the conversation was that she was appalled that she was even in this restaurant - the food didn’t even count as vegan, since they also served meat. In fact, for the ten minutes that I knew her she basically had nothing nice to say about anyone or anything. It was pretty spectacular, listening to one person manage to say nothing nice for ten minutes. She could win Gold in the AsshOlympics.

I’d been standing in line patiently waiting to place an order, with one person in front of me. As she walked in, that person finished ordering, at which point she breezed by me like I didn’t even exist. “I’d like a tofu lo mein.” The woman behind the counter looked at me, and I coughed politely. “I’m sorry, I was here first.” This elicited the biggest, most “how dare you waste MY time” eye roll I’ve ever seen, and she wordlessly stepped back. I ordered a chicken fried rice. Then she ordered her tofu lo mein, and we stepped back to wait for our food.

Ten minutes later the first order popped up at which point this woman, mindlessly chatting with her friend about how much someone they both knew is a total bitch, swiped the order without thinking and without a thank you, and stormed for the door, in a desperate hurry to ruin other people’s evenings somewhere. My first thought was “um, isn’t it likely that my order finished before yours?” And I almost said it. And then I realized she was storming out with a meal she really, really didn’t want.

The next meal popped up about two minutes later. I grabbed it knowing there was a solid chance it was tofu, thanked the very nice woman behind the counter, and left without stopping to open it, afraid that if I wasted a second’s time that angry shrew might have stormed back in and corrected her oversight.

I triumphantly ate a tofu lo mein back at home that night. Well, I ate the lo mein and picked around the tofu. I don’t know if that harpy returned demanding her correct meal or if she just got home, realized it was chicken fried rice, and threw it away dejectedly.

We have a machine that customers are able to use to scan their lotto tickets themselves however he would always get us to scan his lotto tickets (anywhere between 15-20 separate tickets) which pretty much wastes our time and prevents us serving other customers. Once we'd finish scanning his tickets, he would stand at the counter for a few minutes deciding which lotto tickets he would like to buy again (even though he pretty much bought the same ones every week). He would stand there humming and hawing for minutes while we had to wait for him. Then he would ask for his magazine subscription. Each week he would ask for his magazine under a different name just to fuck with us but we all knew who he was so we just grabbed his magazine to get him out of the store as soon as possible.

One Saturday afternoon he lined up at the counter for me to check his lotto tickets. After I was done checking his tickets and giving him new ones (after he spent AGES deciding which ones he wanted) he smirked and asked for his magazine subscription under the name of George Clooney. I told him I would be right back (we kept our subscriptions in the store room at the rear of the store) and I went into the store room to grab his subscription. I grabbed a snack from my bag, sat on a bundle of newspapers and had a 5 minute break whilst I was ""looking"" for his magazine. I could hear him complaining to the girls out the front asking what was taking me so long. When one of the girls came into the store room and asked what was going on, I told her what I was doing and she laughed then spent a few minutes just chilling with me in the store room.

We both went back up to the counter and I could see he was really annoyed with having to wait and even more annoyed that I didn't have his magazine. I apologised to him: ""I'm sorry sir, we couldn't find any subscription under the name of George Clooney. Let me search our orders book for one moment"". He rolled his eyes and told me the real name his subscription was under so I happily trotted back to the store room and found it straight away.

I showed up to a hair cutting place. It was one of the typical chains. I walk in and there is one hair dresser and one guy getting his hair cut by her. The lady told me to sign a paper and she would cut my hair next. About 5 mins later she's finished and the guy pays for his haircut. 

Just as i'm about to get called to get my haircut, apparently one of her good friends walks in and she tells him she can cut his hair before mine! I was kinda pissed, but wasn't going to bother making a fuss of it. 

So i'm waiting probably another 10 mins before another co-worker comes out of the back and says she can cut my hair. I get a super simple haircut probably takes no longer than 10 mins and I finish my haircut about 30 seconds after the other guy. 

We both go to the counter and the lady rings up her friends haircut, $15, i'm guessing a special rate or something. He doesn't tip her anything. I go next and the same lady is ringing up my haircut, with my hairdresser standing behind her. $20. I make sure she sees me hand a $50 to my hairdresser and say how i'm glad she's such an amazing hairdresser and everyone else i've had at the store pales in comparison. 

My hairdresser was stoked! The lady that let her friend cut me tried to play it off like she was happy for her co-worker, but you could definitely see the jealousy!

2017-12-18 15:08:11+00:00,3789,Be shitty to the airline ticket agent over your mistake?...enjoy your wait,DLS3141,"I was not the vengeful airline gate agent, nor was I the asshole, I was just a witness, but it was beautiful to behold.

This happened in the late 1980's, before the internet was everywhere, before cell phones and before the post 9/11 hyper security when you could arrive at a smaller airport an hour before your flight and be on time. 

My parents lived in SW Michigan in the eastern time zone and at the time, the cheapest airport nearby was South Bend, Indiana, which is in the central time zone...sometimes, but does not observe daylight savings time, so for part of the year, the clocks in Indiana are the same as the clocks in MI. Confused? I was.

So I'm flying back to LA through Chicago and show up at the South Bend airport for my flight to Chicago at 7:00 am with what I thought was an hour to spare. Typical of a small airport, there was only one agent checking people in, so I wait, but I have an hour. The guy in front of me is at the counter and starts speaking loudly and angrily at the agent, who explains that he's not an hour early, but the flight he's supposed to be on is on the runway taking off. He completely loses his mind and starts yelling at this poor woman, venting his rage on her as she tells him the next flight to Chicago with an available seat is at 9:00 pm that night. He's cursing her, the airline, the state of Indiana and really just throwing an asshole tantrum. 

As I'm watching this, I realize that I've made the exact same mistake and missed my flight just like this clown. 

After he storms off in his dark rage-cloud of shit, I approach the counter and tell the agent, ""Look, I made the same mistake as that guy, but I know it's my mistake, I'm not going to throw a fit about it."" 

""OK, Mr DLS3141.""

She starts typing stuff into the computer and prints out boarding passes, hands them to me, giving me directions to the bus terminal in the airport.

""This ticket is for the bus to the Chicago airport, it leaves in 20 minutes. When you get there, these are your boarding passes for your flight to LA, you should have plenty of time to make that flight.""

I thanked her profusely and went on my way. I was across the country and home before that guy even boarded his flight to Chicago.

EDIT: I forgot to add that for the flight to LA, she had bumped me up to first/business class. 

TL;DR - Guy is late for flight, acts like an asshole, gets to spend all day in the airport.

2017-12-15 15:50:19+00:00,4132,Apparently I look like a sucker,algy888,"Happened a couple of years ago.
I got a nail in my tire on a Sunday. Not too many places open for flat repair so I head over to Walmart. Now, I’m not saying all Walmarts are like this but I am just relating my personal experience. 
The Sunday manager must have been behind on his numbers or something (like being a lying sack of crap) because our exchange goes like this.

Him: “Yeah, sorry but the nail is too close to the edge you have to get a new tire. And, new government regulations say we can’t sell you just one because then your car would be imbalanced. So, you will need two and that will be $250 ish plus tax (can remember exact numbers but in that range).”

Me: “ Wow, that sounds odd how about you just throw on the little spare and I’ll deal with it tomorrow.”

Him: “Ok but that will be about $10.50 for that service.”

Me: “No problem.”

Next day I take it to a Kal tire and they have never heard of this “new” tire regulation (really?) but yeah I will need to replace the tire and it will cost about $140. At this point I’m thinking didn’t we used to actually fix tires? So I head off to place three after work Tuesday. Went to a Tirecraft last place and they asked if the other two places even took the tire off the rim to see if the sidewall was damaged. I said no. They checked said it’s fine fixed it and didn’t want to charge me due to the stuff I had gone through. I was so relieved to have found an honest person I gave him $20 to buy the crew doughnuts.

Where’s the petty revenge?
Remember Walmart and their $10.50 “service” fee? Well,so did I. Wednesday morning on my way to work I stop by the customer service desk to return my service fee.

Me: “Hi I would like to have my $10.50 back.”

Friendly customer service rep: “Why?”

Me: “ Well, you have a liar and a crook running the auto service on the weekend and I am taking you up on your satisfaction guarantee.”

Friendly csr: “Ok,let me check with my supervisor”

Me: “No problem.” 

Now, I get to share my saga with both of them. They get to hear it all and I use the auto shop guy’s name several times and get my money back. I felt good knowing that the story probably made the rounds of the staff that day. Also, I challenged myself to a year long personal boycott of Walmart which allowed me to tell the story to anyone when that came up in conversation.

2017-12-13 18:26:49+00:00,2057,"You’re not special, you should have paid for the seat you wanted.",Trolivia,"So this literally just happened/is still happening. I love for poetic justice and honest people. But I’m still petty af. So is my sister. We just boarded a plane to California, and it’s a Delta flight. So they have the first class section, then the “Comfort +”, then the regular (and honestly not THAT different) coach seats. Our flight is far from full and a lot of the empty seats are the Comfort + seats. My sister and I are sitting just two rows behind the empty “better” seats. Behind us, a middle-aged woman (she looks like you’d expect, like she’s entitled to everything) asks a flight attendant if she can move forward to one of the empty seats. The flight attendant says “After everyone’s on board, certainly. Just not past row 10 because beyond that is a different section.

A few minutes later, she gets up and moves to row 10. Right away my sister says “she was supposed to wait till everyone’s boarded. Why are people so impatient? I already don’t like her.” Now, before you dive into commentary that we overreact etc, I know. We’re by no means perfect citizens. In fact, we’re both assholes and are quick to judge complete strangers. But, this is r/pettyrevenge so I’m not the least bit sorry.

A few more minutes pass and we see that she is peeking up and down the aisle like some shady hooligan, and she grabs her belongings and moves forward another row to the section she definitely did not pay for. We’re not okay with this. They say snitches get stitches, well sew me the fuck up then because I have no problem calling someone out. 

I subtly flag down the flight attendant so my sister can proudly point out the shady twat in row 9. The flight attendant gives us a wink of approval and flawlessly squats down next to her to say “so this is actually the section I told you you couldn’t move up to so I’m gonna need you to stay in row 10 or further back mmmmkay? Thanks :)))))”. Obviously the woman couldn’t argue about it since she had been caught being naughty, so instead she returned to row 10 and began rambling to herself about how “if no ones using it why does it matter blah blah...” guess what bitch here’s why it matters: you did not pay for the upgraded seat. You don’t deserve a free upgrade more than anyone else. FURTHERmore you’re literally sleeping with headphones in and STILL have the whole row to yourself. I find that stereotypical middle-aged-falsely-entitled-white-woman absolutely infuriating.

To make things even better, some other dude snuck up and tried to do the same thing but again we weren’t having it. I think we’ve developed a pretty good system with the staff. If we see that the woman is being rude to the staff we’re fully prepared to publicly shame her.

TL;DR: last on my flight tried to sneak up to a fancier section and we alerted the flight crew. I have  a zero tolerance policy towards dishonesty and shady behaviour, especially from grown-ass adults. Set a better example for younger generations.

2017-12-11 22:59:08+00:00,7818,"Neighbor threatens to sue me for something ridiculous, so I take action first",alwaysmyfault,"Little backstory, but I own a twinhome by myself. The other side of the twin home is rented by 3 guys in their early 30s.  Earlier this year, there was an incident where one of the roommates ruined my basement carpet by leaving his sump pump hose laid against my house. It was an honest mistake, but he refuses to pay for the damages, so a court case is ultimately upcoming, but I have yet to file the paperwork for it.  So as you can imagine, things are a little tense between us at the moment. 

Now that that's out of the way, on to the story.  This past weekend, a friend of mine ran into one of the roommates that lives next to me. Neither of them realized that they knew me, but after a while, they found out that they both knew me. My neighbor then went off, saying I'm the ""neighbor from hell"" because I plan on taking the other roommate to court to recover my costs for the basement. 

He said that if I do go through with the lawsuit, that the Homeowner they rent from is going to sue me back, claiming the deck on my house is not up to code. 

To the best of my knowledge, you can't sue someone for that since it's not causing you any financial harm, and they're not the building police.  However, just in case something did come about, I checked property records and verified that all permits and inspections were properly done for my deck, so I'm covered..... 

But this got me thinking.... Last summer, my neighbors built their deck. So I checked with the city, and discovered that no permits were filed for it. 

So guess who's going to be getting a visit from the city building inspector later this week?   Ultimately, it may result in them having to tear it down completely, but more likely is that they'll just have to pay a fine.

So the professor gave out different test versions but the only thing different about the two tests was the color. Questions and order were the same and so were the answers.

Anyway, I decided to mark all the wrong answers on the scantron while making notes for myself of the right answer on the actual exam. And he took the bait.

Some questions were so easy and should of given him a hint that either im a complete retard or something’s up but I don’t think he even read the questions.

2017-12-09 12:03:37+00:00,4385,Trash the local smoke spot over and over again? Get fake narced,GandalfDaWhite1,"Back when I was in high school there was a smoke spot in the forest adjacent to a neighborhood. The area was awesome— deep enough into the woods to be hidden from people walking on the path nearby but expansive enough on the inside to sit with bunch of buddies and smoke. After a couple of visits, though, I noticed the place had built up a fair amount of litter from other inconsiderate stoners. So the next time I returned to the spot I came with trash bags and gloves in hand, spending my afternoon cleaning up the place. I grew up valuing the environment and ascribing to the mantra of “leave no trace of your presence in nature,” so picking up litter wasn’t too much of a bother for me, just a minor inconvenience. 

Flash forward to a couple weeks or so later and I return to the spot. To my dismay, the place is absolutely trashed again and requires cleaning up. So I come back with trash bags and gloves, repeat the process of cleaning, then hope for the best.

Another couple weeks or so pass by, I return to the spot, and yet again the place is trashed. This is when I start to get angry. I can’t just creepily lurk in the trees, waiting for someone to litter in order to verbally teach them a lesson. Not only would that be incredibly weird, but probably ineffective. So I devise a plan to use the #1 thing high teenagers are scared of— cops— in order to get people to respect nature or gtfo. 

I, of course, didn’t actually want to call the cops and ruin some 16 year old’s life. So instead I created one of those “Area under surveillance” signs and nailed it to a tree (I know this goes against my own mantra but it was a necessary breach of principle). After a few weeks I came back and success! The place was totally fine, no litter whatsoever. And to whoever was littering, I’m sorry you couldn’t smoke anymore but wow you truly suck.

I realize that my pants are riding a little low, so I stand up and pull them up. Keep in mind I'm still directly in front of the chair, less than 3 inches from it, and my wallet is in the chair. This chair is right next to a vending machine. The woman who was getting something from said vending machine, turns the chair away from me and plops down. She then tells me to get my ass out of her face. I tell her I wasn't done sitting there, she says I got up so it's fair game. I pointed that my wallet is still in said chair. Not even kidding, she reaches under her massive ass, grabs the wallet, and tosses it so that it hits the wall next to the vending machine.

I did something super petty...I was still in between her and the foot stool so I sort of just picked it up and grabbed my wallet and took said foot stool to one of the couches. She tried to tell me to bring it back so I pointed out that her feet weren't up, so it's fair game.

2017-12-04 18:13:42+00:00,3836,Artful fast-food petty revenge. Nothing gross.,GortSmith,"Way back in my struggling to get through college days of yore, I worked part time at the Burger King near my apartment for some extra scratch. This BK was in a pretty sketchy part of town, and neither the facilities, nor the employees, nor the clientele was exactly upper crust. 

Now this is not going to be a story of spitting/pissing in someone’s soda or putting their bun down my pants. I would NEVER do something unhealthy or gross to someone’s food. Nobody deserves that, plus, where is the art? The finesse?

All my co-workers were lazy people with shitty attitudes. The exception (other than me) was this mousy high school girl who worked the drive through on weekends. She was one of those wide-eyed, meek girls who looked barely old enough to work, and really should have been at a kiosk in the mall or something, but for whatever reason she worked at this BK.

All drive-throughs have their share of crap to deal with, but the drive-through at this BK was particularly nasty. It was a never-ending parade of vicious and strangely demanding customer orders. For example, individual cars would often want to order separately for all 6 people in the car during the busy times. If you told them “no” you would get cussed by the entire car, and if they actually stuck around to get their order, one of the drinks would end up blasting into the drive-through window as they sped away cussing. 

People would bang on the windows, yell, throw stuff, and if it wasn’t stuff like that, it was just people frequently being really mean and threatening. Like I said, it was a sketchy part of town. 

Also, for some reason, a lot of people who came to this BK had especially picky and specific orders. A very common thing was to order the original chicken sandwich (the one that is long, not a regular circle-shaped sandwich), load it up with extra toppings, and ask for it cut in half - turning it into a mini-submarine sandwich. I don’t know why this was such a thing at that BK, but it was very common. The order usually went like this:

“I want the original chicken sandwich with extra lettuce, extra mayo, extra pickles, extra tomato, and extra ketchup. And when I say extra ketchup I mean extra ketchup, because ya’ll never put enough ketchup on anything. And make sure it’s HOT! Ya’ll never heat up the sandwich enough. And I want that sandwich cut in half. You hear me? Last time ya’ll didn’t cut it in half! How am I supposed to eat a sandwich that big if ya’ll don’t cut it in half? Don’t make me come in there…shit. Better get it right.”

Typically this didn’t bother me, as I only worked in the kitchen making all the orders and was just focused on getting through the shift. But on days when that nice girl worked, it made my blood boil listening to all the crap she had to endure through her entire shift. If people asked for crazy stuff nicely, I didn’t care. But when the assholes would bark and be mean to her, I would look for especially petty ways to mess with their order.

If someone was yelling about their food not being hot enough, it got microwaved for 2 minutes instead of 15 seconds. Anything with cheese came out like lava. Berating her for 5 minutes about making sure there was enough ketchup? Enjoy your ketchup sandwich, wrapped in 4 wrappers to keep it from leaking everywhere. “Make sure that bacon is crispy, I don’t want no soft bacon!” Into the fryers your bacon goes, until every strip is as hard, brittle, and dark as your soul.

But my masterpiece was when the “load up the original chicken sandwich and cut it in half” people acted like assholes. I would load that sandwich up just like they demanded, with every damn topping they screamed for. Lettuce piled up to the sky. Gobs of ketchup and mayo, oozing through the mountain of tomatoes and pickles that were expertly stacked between the two stalest buns I could find. Nuked for 2 minutes in the microwave.

“And don’t forget to cut it in half! How am I supposed to eat a sandwich if ya’ll don’t cut it in half?!”

Oh I didn’t forget. I always remember to cut it in half. 

THE LONG WAY.


TL,DR:
Act like a jerk in the drive through, I will cut your sandwich in half the long way.


EDIT: Damn that is a lot of love for this story. Glad I could make some folks chuckle.

Enjoy not being able to park there for two weeks.",Zanekay,"Where I live is on a street that has plenty of on street parking. My neighbor however, always parks on this one spot. The spot can easily fit two cars but he always parks in the middle to stop others from parking there. Doesnt really concern me as I just park 10 meters down the road. 

When ever guests come over and hes not there they park in that same spot. Leaving enough room for him to park there aswell ofcourse, theyre not ass holes. Anyway, when ever this happens and he arives home while theyre still over he will either come and knock on the door and explain that hes lived there for 10 years, theres not enough room for two cars, thats where hes always parked and blah blah blah, or wait for the guests to leave and go explain to them the same crap. Everytime he does this I just explain to him that he doesnt own the spot regardless of how long hes lived there. 

About two years ago I moved from the other side of Australia out of home and away from my parents for work. I see them once twice a year when i go to visit. This time Im away for two weeks. As im leaving yesterday I go outside to my uber who is waiting outside and I notice something, hes not home. The evil in me awoke. As the driver was putting my bags in the boot I told him i just had to move my real quick. So i ran inside and moved the car. I obvioulsy parked it right in the middle so there is no way he can park there at all. As i got into the Uber i explained the whole thing to the driver and we had a good laugh about it. 

Can wait to get home and see the look in his face. 

TL;DR Neighbor complains when people park in ""his spot"" so i parked there for two weeks while i went on holidays. 

Edit; The car is parked legally and it is registerd. The car would have to be there for a long time for it to be towed. Thanks for your concern though!

Edit 2; I have security cameras out the front of the house which can see the car. The cars only worth about $3000, dont really care if he damages it. He can pay for it. 

Edit 3 (for the people who cant read); The car in no way is parked illegally. If the property line were to run out onto the road it would pass half through my car. The car is half out the front of his house and half out the front of mine. There is plenty of on street parking so no one is being affected. There is parking on the otherside of his driveway. In australia a car can be parked as long as it wants were it wants providing its parked legally, and is registerd. Its not going to get towed as it is registerd and parked legally.

So a long while ago I worked at a popular fast food restaurant, in a town that’s mixed with travelers and locals. I had worked for this chain for close to three years and had just transferred to a new location because of a better pay scale. 

About a month after this change, I’m getting in the swing of things and getting used to how this new location works, I was learning the regular dinner customers orders during the evening as I was often the closing manager. One week I was put in charge of a random 12:30-21:00 shift, nothing I haven’t done at other locations but a nice change for this new store. 

Things are going as the lunch rush is progressing, sales are on track but my drive thru is moving a little slower than my lobby. I ask the person running orders in drive thru how I can help, she tells me that this customer refuses to move his truck to a waiting spot even though he has a two minute wait on his fries. 

Me, being my very calm, cool, and collected self proceeds to try and ask the customer my self if he would move, to which he responds “my truck is too big for your tiny parking lot, I don’t have insurance that would cover getting hit... besides it’s not my fault you’re so slow.” 

Once again keeping a very calm demeanor, I try to explain that there are orders ready behind his that are smaller, and by him not moving it’s messing with other people getting their food. 

This is the point where he rolled up his window on me mid sentence. 

I had three orders ready behind him, and had already explained to him that he had a two minute wait regardless, if he refused to move then there was no reason the customers behind him had to wait for their meals. I took each order out that was ready behind his, four total, explained why they had such a long wait, and gave them free meal coupons for their next visit. 

Once I was done Mister I-won’t-move’s fries were up and I happily handed him his ordered. He angrily asked why the other customers got their food before him, to which I told him I already explained their orders behind his were smaller, that he had to wait regardless, and to have a nice day.

2017-11-30 21:18:38+00:00,14534,I had a neighbor that always called the cops on me.,TheMeatWhistle45,"She lived right above me and may have not been playing with a full deck. She would call in noise complaints on me all the time. Like at least twice a week for a couple months. The funny thing is that I was not being loud. A couple times she did it when I was asleep.

The cops were always dicks about it when they showed up so I just stopped answering my door. I worked two jobs and was rarely home, so when I was, I just wanted to sleep for a few hours.

Anyway, I had a computer with a surround system (that I never used because I’m a polite neighbor) so I set it up in my bedroom which was right under hers. When I worked an overnight shift, I would crank up the volume on the computer and log into AoL. My instant message alert was a squealing pig. I would wait until about 2am and start sending myself messages from my work computer for a minute or so. 

I would listen to my police scanner until the police were called. I would giggle like a school girl and knock it off for the night. Eventually the landlord kicked her out because of the complaints from both myself and the police. 

After she moved out, the landlord stopped by to chat and said “the crazy broad told me you had pigs living in your apartment!”  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7gppdp/i_had_a_neighbor_that_always_called_the_cops_on_me/,pettyrevenge,433,0.0
2017-11-30 03:32:50+00:00,8390,Abuse your dog and threaten my girlfriend? Enjoy never sleeping again.,mystical_croissant,"About 2 years ago my girlfriend and I lived in a corner townhome next to some particularly trashy neighbors. Lets call them “Joey” and “Jamie” since I hate them and don't care about using their real names. 

At first we all got along but over time our relationship with them deteriorated. He was an obvious drug dealer, ex-con piece of garbage and she was just as bad if not worse. We would always hear their fights through the walls and it wasn't uncommon to see him leaving the house with a black eye every couple of weeks.

The worst part was their dog. He was a huge 150+ lb bulldog that was mean as hell. I never once saw that dog leave the house and any time I was in there they had to tie him up or restrain him from jumping at people and tearing them up. He never went on a walk in 3 yrs that we lived there. He had to shit in a tiny 8x8 square of concrete that never got cleaned, so it was basically a tiny rectangle of piss and feces that stunk up the whole area. No wonder he was nasty and aggressive. 

And he cried. As soon as they left until the second they got home which was normally 12 hrs a day. Long drawn out baying howls that you could hear across the whole complex. At the time I was working night shifts and it became unbearable because even with ear plugs and white noise it was all I could hear. 

I had talked to him about it a few times and every time it went nowhere, with just a ""well thats the way he is"" resolution.

One day I snapped. I ran downstairs and slapped the wall next to where his kennel was as hard as I could to shut him up and get some sleep. Little did I know Jamie had been home the whole time letting him howl. 

She flew into a fury and started screaming through the walls and slapping back. I knew there was going to be trouble. Later that night Joey came home high as hell with his eyes bugged out and we had a regrettable screaming match on the front stoop where they screamed at us, insulted us, and threatened my girlfriend when she said she was going to call the cops. 

7 days later we moved out. Now, we always had a big jar of dead batteries that we collected for no real reason at all in the basement. And once the last box was packed I went and put one dead AA battery in each of the smoke alarms in every room of the house. 

Our landlords were close friends who had told us that we would be their last tenants before they sold, so the house sat vacant for 7 months. And for 6 of those long months, our house beeped from every room. 

We ran into our old landlord last year at the grocery store. She told us when they finally went back to tear up the carpets and fix up the place Joey and Jamie had pounded on the door begging for them to change the smoke alarms, the HOA wouldn't respond to their complaints and they were going absolutely crazy. 

Revenge at its absolute pettiest

**********************************


Edit: hey everyone just woke up. What a response. Let's address some things.

First, yes [American bulldogs can get pretty heavy](https://imgur.com/O4BToKI), add in no exercise for years on top of a poor diet and it's entirely plausible this dog pushed 150 lbs.

Edit 2- yes they do make AA [smoke detectors](https://imgur.com/F7NRJ9o) come on guys

Second, you are all correct that a call to animal control was justified. We had multiple letters and complaints in to the HOA. But someone on the board was telling their landlord exactly who was submitting the ""anonymous"" complaints and every time they got a letter it was escalating the situation. I feel like this is illegal for the HOA to disclose? We probably could have pushed that issue deeper as well if we wanted. 

At the end we just didn't feel safe living next to them, and i have no idea what he would have done if I got his dog taken away. we were so sick of the drama that we just wanted to be done and move on. Anyone who has ever known what it's like to not feel safe in your own home knows how awful it can be. 

I still feel terrible for that dog and reading everyone's responses made me realize he probably suffered from the noise more than they did. 

Our landlord told us they had moved out not long after her place sold. Hopefully the dog is being taken care of better now.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7gjd8a/abuse_your_dog_and_threaten_my_girlfriend_enjoy/,pettyrevenge,329,0.0

Well, I guess I better make sure I know when I work.",pangeathepanda,"I spent four years working weekends at a large deli chain restaurant. I worked FOH since day 1, and was the most experienced server and cashier that worked there. In my last year, we got a new district manager, had 3 different GMs, and had about a 2 month turnover for the new hourly employees.

The newest GM was AWFUL. Our branch was in a mall and was busy constantly, but she forced us to stick to the other branches’ staffing maximums (like 1 cashier from 5-11 a.m.  and 2-4 p.m.) and said that since we should be ready to close 15 minutes after the restaurant did, employees who worked within 5 hours of close did not need a break. She was also bitchy, rude to the staff, and made it clear that as a GM of a deli she was SO MUCH BETTER than us low-life servers. I was close to my breaking point, but decided to stick it out since I knew they’d be screwed without me. Under her management, seasoned employees were leaving almost as quickly as new ones.

One Saturday morning, after staying out until 3 a.m., I was awakened by a phone call at 4:30 in the goddamn morning from my GM, demanding to know where I was. I told her I worked at noon, and she said I was supposed to be there to open at 4, and threatened to fire me if I didn’t show in 15.

I called her bluff and said I’d be in at 7. At 7 I walked in and was met by an angry GM and the apologetic shift lead. The GM grabbed me by the shoulder and marched me to the back, spun me around, and shoved me almost face-first into the schedule. She pointed to my name, and sure enough, I was scheduled for 4 a.m. as the only cashier until lunch. 

Confused and seeing red, I pulled out my phone with the picture of the schedule I’d taken the previous Sunday, which showed me as scheduled from 12-8. She looked at the picture and rolled her eyes, then said “Well duh, I changed the schedule on Tuesday.”

I reminded her I only worked weekends, and she told me that it was my responsibility to know the schedule (which was only available from the print-out in the BOH) and gave me my first ever write-up for being “lazy, irresponsible and unreliable.”

Two days later I handed in 4 weeks notice. I apologized to my gloating GM for my behavior on Saturday, and promised to be on time for the rest of my shifts.

So, every week day from 5 a.m. - 9 p.m. for the next 4 weeks, I called the restaurant’s customer line every 2 hours, asking about the schedule. Every 2 hours I held up the phone, made someone stop ringing/running orders to answer it, and had them leave the FOH to go look at the schedule. Every time the GM told me to stop, I told her I was just too afraid of being late to risk it. The day before my last scheduled day, I called the restaurant and asked for the GM. She angrily told me that just like the schedule said, I worked at 4 a.m. the next morning, and as the only cashier in the busy restaurant until lunch (which was her decision to schedule), I had better be there “or else.”

I apologized and told her that I wasn’t actually calling about the schedule, but to call in sick. I hope she had fun opening as the cashier the next day!

TLDR: Manager changed the schedule without telling me and wrote me up for being late. I called the restaurant asking about it every 2 hours until I quit, then called in sick for my last day when I was the only scheduled cashier, forcing her to work my 4 a.m. shift.

_________________

When I rented my first house with my then girlfriend we had this neighbor who for this story we will call A for asshole. A had a dog, Theo. Theo was a big dog so he made huge shits, like the kind you would expect to get from a small cow. 

The first time I mowed the lawn (huge yard, the house was in the left side of the lot with a big yard to the left of the lot) I got dog shit all over my jeans, it was so bad I had to trow the jeans in the trash. At first I thought it was the previous tenant’s  dog so I left it at that. 

Until one day I see A throwing Theo’s shit over my fence, I go confront him about it and he just said “I’ve always done that, never had a complaint. You have a huge yard so its not a problem, right?” 

I just stood there dumbfounded, like im there confronting him about it and the guy said theres no problem. I repeated my request and went home. 

But A kept tossing Theo’s shits over the fence. One day I had enough and decided that it was fair to give a taste of his own medicine. Every Sunday, right before mowing the lawn, I would scoop up Theo’s shit then deposited said shit in a container. I did this for over a year. 

Then once I decided that I had enough I went over to A’s house and emptied the container by his front door and left a note, “I think this belongs to you”. 

Just sat there at my porch waiting for him to come home with a cooler and a few beers by my side. When he got home he held his shirt over his nose and looked at the note, then at me. 

I just waved, like a happy neighbor. He never threw another of Theo’s shits over my fence again. 

Edit: Obligatory RIP inbox. 

Also to clear up a few things. Search how to make compost with dog poop, it’s basically what I did. 

I no longer live at the rental, moved between places a bit then signed a contract with the devil a few years ago. 

Stop asking for pictures of something that happened a long time ago. Don’t have any. 

He didn’t retaliate, just didn’t talk to me after that and gave me the stink eye every time he saw me from that moment forward.

2017-11-25 14:09:28+00:00,4581,A kid called my girlfriend a bitch after my girlfriend let them go ahead of us in a crosswalk.,Pikachu5555,"Someone posted a story on here that made me think of something that happened to me about 4 years ago. My girlfriend and I were passing through a school zone one day and a bunch of kids that lived around the school were walking home. 

We were driving through and came to a crosswalk so my girlfriend stops and waves these 3 younger looking girls on to go ahead of us. There were 2 blondes and a brunette. The brunette hits the sidewalk and turns towards our car and yells ""thanks bitch!"" And flips us off and runs away with the 2 blondes.

They cut through some yards but we could see what street they ended up on. I told my gf to pull over there. I was fired up haha no one calls my girl a bitch and gets away with it! So after some coaxing I finally talk her into driving over to that street.

They all there are facing away from the road walking up to a house. I thought oh this is too good I'm gonna go up to them and ask who is home so they will feel scared I'm gonna tell their parents. At least that was the plan walking up.

They are almost to the door so my gf pulls over in front and I walk up after them and say ""why is the world would you call my girlfriend that when she's trying to be nice to y'all??!"" They turn around like they've seen a ghost. I immediately notice one of the blondes is younger than the other 2. I ask them how old they are and if their parents allow them to cuss. I also notice is that these 2 blondes are scared as heck but the brunette that called her bitch has an attitude and seems mad. She says ""I can say whatever the fuck I want, they don't care..."" 

This pissed me off so I ask how old they are. The 2 older girls are 12 and the younger is 10. I ask whose house this is and the blondes both immediately point at the brunette. I say okay let's see how your parents feel about this then and walk up to the screen door like I'm gonna knock. The brunette laughs and says my parents aren't here. I say that's fine I'll just wait here for them. It's about 3:30 at this point and the brunette says they won't even be here until 5. 

I say good that's when I'll come back over then so we can talk about what you said to my girlfriend. Now the brunette looks scared. I ask the blondes are you guys gonna be here at 5? They shake their heads yes. I say when her parents get here will you let them know what's going on and that I'll be back by to talk to them? They kinda look like they feel bad for having to snitch but I tell them as long as they tell the brunettes parents ill make sure their parents don't find out. They promise and the brunette starts crying and finally seems sorry. She walked up my girlfriends car and apologized before running in the house with her friends. 

I never went back or even had any intention of telling anyones parents haha. Hell I remember being that age and trying anything to be cool in front of my friends. I just wanted to teach them a lesson about consequences and the power of calling someone a name when they don't deserve it in the real world.

2017-11-24 16:12:38+00:00,4208,Try and bully me in school? Come meet my older brother.,mollypop94,"Wow so this happened *way* back. I'm talking almost 10 years ago when I was 13/14. Long story short, this boy in my year showed interest in me, he was this loud mouthed, cocky, obnoxious arsehole and I was quiet asf. It took me a long time to even pick up on the fact that he fancied me, and when I realized, I knew I didn't find him attractive in any way.

So, it seemed he picked up on this, and instantly turned from showing interest, to being an absolute, 100% bully towards me. Picking up on how quiet he was, for months he ripped into the way I dressed (early teens goth phase ftw), that I was stupid, and it eventually got into darker territory.

(long story short, he picked up on the fact that I self harmed and mocked me badly about it, getting his follower, spinless mates to join in. Trying to pull my sleeves up during class etc. Rough time.)

Anyway, I never thought about the fact that I have two older, HUGE brothers. I never told anyone about this issue, let alone them. Deep down I knew they'd throttle the scrawny fuck, so maybe that's why.

Well, one day, months into this daily shit, my second oldest brother visited from uni, picked me up and drove me around, catching up. He used to go to my school but left just as I began. He asked what was up, noticed I seemed quiet than usual. I broke down *slightly* mentioning about this arsehole I was dealing with. Kind of gave him the light version, as not to anger him too much.

...Too late.

My brother was silent, and just nodded. He said, ""I'll take care of it."" and we enjoyed the rest of the day as if nothing happened, I felt comforted.

That night, my bro says, ""Ha, guess who I had a talk with on the phone?"" Turns out, he *somehow* found the boy's home number. He called him up, threatened to break his jaw. The scared little rat started to get ballsey, shouting back in his barely-broken voice. He even tried to make fun of my brother for having a prothestic leg, he must've heard about it through school. (something that's never held him back or even bothered him for a second.)

Did I mention my brother was/is a gym freak? Despite his prosthetic, he was huge. Very largely built, big beard, aggressive-looking, the lot. Bully had never actually seen him before.


So, the next day, brother says, ""Forget the bus, I'll drive you into school, we'll get a Mcdonalds on the way."" (he was very good to me)

We drive up, and he jumps out as he spots his old gym teacher. I'm standing beside them both as they catch up over old time's sake. Two HUGE guys, arms folded, chatting away. As I'm standing next to my bro, who walks out from the bus? 

The scrawny little loud mouth fuck. He struts down the path toward school, sees me and smirks. His eyes then lifts towards my brother and I see him skip in his step, his eyes bulging with fucking shit-scared fear when he realizes that *this* was the dude he tried to shit-talk on the phone. 

I remember smiling at the boy, feeling my eyes glistening with glee. I lifted my arm to tap my brother's shoulder, and I saw the boy pause in actual fear. 

I let my brother know I'm heading in now, he gives me a gentle shoulder punch and tells me to have a good day.

That split second of pure dread and terror on that little cunt's face was more than enough for me. If i'd let my brother know who he was, there'd be chaos. He'd have actually had him up against the wall by the scruff, no doubt. And I didn't want my brother in trouble.

Since that day...he stayed the ever loving fuck away from me. No eye contact, head down to the ground. Beautiful.

He starts making excuses that he was in a rush, and didnt realise he needed a ticket blah blah blah. I ask if he has money for a ticket, he does. A £20 note. Noooo problem!

I’m at the end of my shift nearly, so I print his ticket (cost like £5 or so). And give him all of the change in literal change. No notes, and very few pound coins, I’m talking all silvers here, 20p coins and 5p’s.

* My grandmother in law loves my cooking and begs me to make something for every holiday. I was due to bring some baked mac and cheese over for Thanksgiving tomorrow, and she was super excited as it's one of my best dishes.
* My kids' dad is autistic. So is our oldest child (3yo).
* GIL is very into conspiracy theories and we just had a big fight about vaccines a couple of weeks ago when she found out that I was getting the kids their flu shots.
* GIL also does not believe that my son or his dad are autistic because they ""seem so normal.""

Okay, so here's the story and petty revenge:

Yesterday, GIL posted an article talking about how vaccines cause autism that was basically ""hurrdurr big pharma, hurrdurr autism."" The typical antivaxx shit. This being right after our argument about getting the kids their vaccines.

My petty revenge is that I wrote a very long, very angry comment on her post about how idiotic it is that she believes such incredible sources and how even if it were true, the fact that she thinks people dying of smallpox and measles is preferable to having a child like mine is dangerous, ridiculous, and offensive.

I then told her our side of the family wouldn't be making it to Thanksgiving, so we'll be chilling out at home and eating an entire pan of baked mac and cheese between the four of us alongside my signature rosemary garlic pork loin.

2017-11-22 13:45:47+00:00,2894,Airplane seatback punishment,lolwtfomgbbq7,"So I was just on a plane ride with United, so the leg room was extremely tight. It's early morning and I'm not in the mood to fuck around. Then, at the start of the flight the guy in front of me started trying to push his seat back. I have very long legs, so he gets it pushed back about half way and it pushed up against my legs, making me very uncomfortable. The guy starts pushing repeatedly against his seat, which won't go all the way back because he keeps hitting my knees. He subsides for a few minutes, and I think he has given up, but no, he starts pushing again. He pushes against his seat and then turns around and looks back, making eye contact with me, and then tried pushing again.

Now from this extremely awkward eye contact I know this guy knows he is pushing my knees, and I decide I've had enough. I wait for the next time he tries to push his seat back and I slowly inch my knees up a little bit, so that his final seat position is slightly higher than it was before but not enough that he would realize. He tries pushing back again and I move his seat upward again. Ten minutes of this, and he has a fully upright seat on our early morning flight, and he is probably terribly inconvenienced. 

Edit: Wow this is a hotly contested issue!

2017-11-20 18:02:41+00:00,2490,Oh you “just” had a baby and use that as an excuse to fuck up MY grade...,DrJanekyll,"FTP, on mobile apologies for format, blah blah blah. 

We’ve all been here. 

Group projects still happen at the college level, for me it was once every term, as each class required a team or group project to determine how we were able to work with a group...we were graded on that and evaluated. I got fucked twice before this and picked up the slack bc gpa, both times before and I was over it. The third group project comes up and it was looking like I was about to be fucked again, but by half of our group. There’s six of us this time, and two of the six shirked it the week before the start of the project already, with the third already making excuses bc she “just” had a baby. So, I convinced the rest of my group to leave the two other team members’ names off of our project header, and to give the third person another shot as she “just” had a baby (turns out baby was actually 8 months old) and she was still adjusting. 

There were rules to this project, the first was that we could only communicate through the public forum within the class, so the prof could see that all groups members were participating and all members had access to the forum, we had to elect a person (Team Leader) to do final editing and turn in the final project, and we had to turn in a form with our own personal recommendations for grades for the other members of our group of which we had to each turn in ourselves. We were given our group members names and the actual project a week prior, to give us extra time to get it done and to communicate within the forum, and assign slides. 

Well after that first week of initial set up and passing out slide assignments within the group, we realized what I have already stated, two of the six of us were out, and the third was wishy washy at best. I opted to do an extra set of slides as well as Team Leader. We decided to utilize google docs (technically not against the rules bc all members had access) and get our stuff done together, offer help and all that. Our elected team leader sent an invite to all six members, and four of the six are there, including PostPartum, we exchanged phone numbers to communicate via mass txt, and we were all set to start. 

We decided to give each member four days to complete their slides and then the next two, to let team leader edit and format so there are all the same font, back ground, etc. Four days pass, and three of us posted our slides within the public forum, so Team Leader and the Prof had access to our slides, team leader for editing. After a day Team Leader was overwhelmed with the editing and formatting, which we understood as there were 20+ slides, so we decided to work together and all logged in to google docs to get it done. 

But someone was missing, PostPartum, our wishy washy teammate wasn’t there. We each spent the next hour editing and all that, while calling PostPartum and txt’ing her to get her to log in to google docs to help. Finally PostPartum logged in to google docs with us to format all of our slides and suchety such, but after about 30 mins, through out little side bar chat, we realized she wasn’t actually doing anything. As you know, in google docs, you can see where each person is, which slide they’re on, and what they are changing or adjusting. We sat there and watched, and she changed the font a couple of times, changed the color of the font a couple of times, and then just stayed on that slide, doing nothing. We realized what was happening...we are about to be fucked again. So we prompted her to action. 

We asked her through chat to add her slides in so we could format those too. That is when the excuses came, “I don’t know how to do it, I must have mislabeled my file bc I can’t find them,” blah blah blah. So we all said ok, well since all of the others are done, and we just need yours, why don’t you just add them by the end of tonight, and DrJaneKyll will format them in the morning and Team Leader will edit for any spelling mistakes and turn it in. PostPartum agreed to txt when her slides were added to our google doc. 

The next day comes and no one has gotten a txt, so we called PostPartum, no answer, no return txts. We scramble and decide that we would each take one slide from her required 5 slides, and who ever finished first would move on to a second slide, and same with who finished second. Well I finished first, and then second, and ended up doing three of her five slides. I was pissed. I have kids too, I have other obligations that needed my attention, and I had to adjust, just like the other two women on our team, but this lady was milking the baby angle. So I decided to remind the other women on the team that we are graded 80% of our grade on our slides, and 10% on the project as a whole (meaning we had to hit the amount of slides required) and 10% based off of the other teammates grading us. So then I decided to let it slip that PostPartum wasn’t exactly a “new” Mom, but a mother of a nearly 1 year old. Aghast at this new info, we decided to let PostPartum know we opted to do her slides for her, to help her out like we did with the other two teammates who fucked us. Also, that bc she “just had a baby” we would add her name to the project cover page. She was happy, needless to say, bc she was getting her slides done and didn’t have to do shit. 

After we finished her slides, but before we were left google docs, we txt her to go look at the slides and make sure she was okay with them and to let us knowif she was good with them. Remember, we could see who was logged on and where they were working in the doc. She never logged in, she never went over her slides, less than two mins later she said they were “great” and thanked us for helping her out and tried to relate to us on a maternal level. So now that she approved her slides, I went in and changed her slides, the font to different fonts from slide to slide and even bullet point to bullet point, including comic sans. I used different colors of font throughout the slides, purposely misspelled a lot of the medical terms, and then copied and pasted bullet points off a few of our other slides (left the font and colors the same from the copied slides) to show that she obviously copied and pasted from our slides. Then added her name to the cover. The Prof knew, from the public forum, who was assigned which set of slides, so she knew who these slides belonged to. 

Her slides were all over the place, she couldn’t blame us either bc she went on the class forum saying her slides were emailed to Team Leader, but she also never posted her actual slides to the class forum. 

Needless to say she got called out and given a talking to (our prof was nice and opted to talk to her instead of turn her in) for plagiarizing, and was given a barely passing grade for her slides, a zero from us, as we continued to post on our forum where the teacher could see, about PostPartum being late on turning in her slides, leaving us unable to edit, and a lot of back and forth showing our many attempts to include her and offer help. She txt me bc apparently she related to me the most, asking what happened to her slides. I told her she saw what was turned in, and approved them. She was only given a full score on the 10% that counted for amount of slides. Needless to say, we didn’t see her in any of our psych 200 classes in any of the following terms. Don’t fuck with my grades bitch and use “just” having a baby as an excuse. 

Tl;dr: Had group project, one group member used being a new mom as an excuse not to do her work. So I messed up her slides and passed them off as hers. She got in trouble. 

Edit: Just for anyone thinking I’m a heartless bitch, and that being a parent is so overwhelming that it’s okay you screw people over. I too was going through things, but I made and paid for this commitment to school, and nothing short of being in a coma, would have stopped me from finishing this group project, if not for me, but for the other people in my group. 

Edit 2: Just an fyi, I was going through my own shit, of which I can’t say, bc then I’d out myself. Trust me though, everything that could shake your life up, I was going through.

2017-11-19 17:01:11+00:00,3495,Take out your own trash,heinzliketchup57,"One day I get to work and look in the bed of my truck to see a bag of trash. First thing I think is my girlfriend was too lazy to walk it to the dumpster of our apartment, no big deal I'll toss it away. As I'm walking to the dumpster at work it hits me that this is a black trash bag and we have white, hmmm.

Little backstory, we live in a rather nice apartment complex and there are pretty strict rules governing the outside of your building. One rule in particular is that no trash is allowed in the hallway, we learned this the hard way our first week in the new place. $25.00 fine and a picture on your door of the bag. Turns out my neighbors had called and complained about the bag after about an hour and we opened the door to find the fine. 

Okay back to the bag, I realize this isn't our bag so I open it and right there on top is an envelope with our neighbors address, the same neighbor that complained about our trash and got us fined. ""Ryan"". Jokes on you buddy. So I'm on nightshift and finish my shift and stay a little extra late in the morning until about 7:30-8 am. When I got to the house I set the trash in front of his door and wrote on the envelope ""Ryan, you may have forgotten this in my truck.."" and called the main office to complain about the trash. 

I go to sleep and wake up around 3 pm and head out to take my dog for a walk. On their door is a picture of the trash and the note which you can still clearly read and a notice of $25.00 fine. 

Man that put a little smile on my face, and no one leaves trash in my truck anymore.

TLDR: someone put their trash in my truck. A little detective work and I put in front of their door. They got fined by the apartment complex.

2017-11-17 08:08:15+00:00,3078,Thought it was cool to be a racist little punk? Think again!,small_goose,"It was a gorgeous summer day. For one reason or another I was home in the middle of the day and decided to take my dog out for a nice long walk.

The first thing I notice is that there is this incessant, loud, cacophonous...noise happening. Get outside, see that it's my neighbour's kid having band practice in the garage. Sure, no worries. It's the middle of the day, who am I to complain about excessive noise at this hour? No problem. No worries either about the fact that the house LITERALLY had kids all over it. On the roof, on the roof of the garage, hanging out, whatever it is kids do.

I walk around the block, and note that you can still clearly hear their ""music"" a full block away. Whatever. I continue walking and have to pass them before it get back home. My sweet little dog and I, we're minding our own business. It's a gorgeous day. I'm telling her how she's the prettiest girl in the world when I'm interrupted by a little punk ass shit yelling this racist crap (I'm Chinese) into the microphone! For the duration of time that it takes me to walk past the house!

Nooooo problem.

Later that evening, it's just after dinner time when I decide to mosey on over and introduce myself. Knock on the door, Dad comes to greet me. ""Hi,"" I say. ""You don't know me but my name is small_goose and I live in that house right over there. I'm not sure if you're aware but when your son has band practice over here it's quite dangerous as these kids are all over your roof. But the most concerning thing to me was that when I walked by this afternoon, your son was shouting racial obscenities at me. I know you didn't raise your son to be that way so I just wanted to let you know.""

At this moment, a bright-faced sweet little cherubic angel  pops out from nowhere and says,"" YES! I was here. I heard it all! "" aw, shucks lil bro. Your timing is perfect.

Dad's mouth sets into a firm line.""Get your brother from the basement,"" he says. Little bro gleefully goes off to retrieve his punk ass brother.

Dad says, ""TOMORROW MORNING. I AM THROWING OUT THAT DRUM SET.""

Guess what was on the curb the next day? :)

Edit: clarity

2017-11-16 13:02:52+00:00,3973,Falsely accuse me of making too much noise .. have some real noise,TheFailSnail,"This was around 20 years ago. I just moved out of my parents house and into my own place. A nice 3-room apartment in an apartment building. This is the moment you grew up and move out, so you can enjoy all the adult stuff, like walking around in your underwear at 3pm and eating 25 breadsticks (TAKE THAT MOM). Anyway, that's beside the story. 

I was on the 4th floor of the apartment and after living there for about 2 years on good terms with basicly all my neighbours, the apartment on the 3rd floor directly beneath me got rented to a new couple. They we're old.. as in... 60+ old and home ALL THE TIME. This wasn't a problem, since I was out most of the days for work and when I got home during evenings I'd sit behind the computer. A couple of weeks after they moved in, the lady from downstairs came at my door on a Saturday. ""Could you stop making so much noise? We're downstairs and it's unbearable."". Ok... I never had complaints from the previous neighbours and I had to go out, so I told them I'd be more considerate. I had no idea what I was doing wrong, since I wasn't home much, but hey. 

A couple of weeks pass and we fast forward to an evening somewhere during the week. I just got home from work and was cooking food when the downstairs neighbour came by again. ""We're going to call the police if you keep this up!"". Right. I just came home from work, I'm tired and I do not handle this well. ""Hey lady. I just got home. There's no way I'm making too much noise. So stop complaining and call the damn police if you want to"". Something along these lines was my political answer. ""If you don't believe it. Come listen yourself.""

Time for a break. I'm the only 1 in my apartment and she just invites me to come listen in their apartment to the noise I should be making. It started dawning on me that this might not be the smartest neighbour ever. ""Ok, let's go"". I went down to their apartment and stepped inside. They had no curtains and hardly any paintings or furniture up, so the apartment was noisey. I stood in the living room with her husband and her telling me how much noise I was making daily. ""Listen!"". I listened and there were indeed sounds, but nothing noisey. ""Listen up. I'm currently in your apartment, so it can't possibly be me making these sounds. They're not even that loud, so stop complaining about it to me"".

""I handled that pretty well"" was my thought as I went back to my apartment. Sadly, they had a different opinion.

Their complaints started escalating from hitting their ceiling with (what I assume) was a broom, to ticking on the radiator. That sound carries through the entire building I assume. I'm pretty good at drowning out my surroundings when I'm playing a computer game, so it didn't bother me that much. Until 1 day, they decide to come to my door AND WAKE ME UP TO TELL ME THAT I AM MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE. I opened the door and there was the husband (who was obvious sent by his wife) and when he saw me he knew that I wasn't in the mood AND that I just got woken up by him. He almost apologetically told me that I was making too much noise. I looked at him and said nothing for 3 seconds. Then said ""ok"" and closed the door.

IT! IS! FUCKING! ON! NOW!

Next morning, 7am. I get out of bed and stomp my way to the living room and kitchen to make my breakfast. Let me just turn on some music aswell. Not too loud, but probably noticeable downstairs. I accidentally drop my knife like 10 times on the kitchen floor (stones that make a nice DINGpingping... pingping sound when you drop a knife on them). I go to work, slam some doors, and forget to turn off my music. I get home after work, slam more doors. Do my stuff behind the computer, but after 11pm I make sure to ocassionally hit the radiatorpipe which is running through my bedroom .. and thus also through their bedroom. Basicly.. I made sure to be the obnoxious neighbour that never was. I kept this up for about a week. After that I returned to my normal behavior again and they never once complained to me again (for the remaining 5 years I've lived there). I assume that either the woman got the point or the man grew a pair and stood up to his nagging wife. I don't care much, cause either way my problem was solved.

TL:DR;

Complaining downstairs neighbour. Woke me up to complain about the noise I was apparently making while sleeping. Gave them the noise they had been complaining about for half a year already. Taught them a valuable lesson (this last bit is dubious :)).",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7dc8bv/falsely_accuse_me_of_making_too_much_noise_have/,pettyrevenge,238,0.0
2017-11-15 15:57:53+00:00,2368,Decided to play video games instead of clean up the kitchen? Have fun disconnecting mid-game.,Sycamori,"So my boyfriend and I have a simple rule. I'll cook the meals if he cleans up afterwards. He's really, really bad at actually doing his side of the chore, though. He's procrastinated on the kitchen so long that I had run out of every single clean dish, pot, and pan even after washing a few myself. It's been at least a week.

I asked him to please, for the love of God, just clean up. The kitchen was disgusting. He told me he was going to play more video games, and maybe clean up if he had time before work. That didn't fly with me. My boyfriend is not very internet or computer savvy, I am the one who repairs his computer or fixes the net.

I decided to log into our router and add his computer to MAC filtered devices, meaning his internet would inexplicably shut off and on at my discretion during his game, which was League of Legends. If I heard him making intense calls on comms, I'd shut off the Internet and then back on seconds later. Hear him clicking more and probably in an intense 1v1? Shut it down for two minutes, then let him back on. 

I wasn't a suspect at all, considering I was innocently laying in the bedroom with our dog and he doesn't even know what MAC Filtering is. He kept screaming in frustration and pacing around waiting for the Internet to come back on, I kept asking him if he wanted me to take a look at his computer but he declined. He decided not to play any more games afterward and finally cleaned the kitchen. Thank fuck.

2017-11-15 02:29:02+00:00,5188,i’ll make sure you never get a date again,advancedcancer,"Over two years ago, I dated a boy for around 5 or 6 months. Let’s call him X. Ultimately, I broke up with X because he routinely sexually assaulted me, cheated on me, threatened to tell my mother horrific and untrue things about me if I left him, and many other things of that sort. We don’t talk regularly, but every time he likes a girl he’ll pretend to text me accidentally and tell me about it in an attempt to make me jealous. I have a friend who X talks to regularly, and this friend will then tell me the name of the girl he’s crushing on. 

Every time this happens, I send the girl a DM. I tell her that I heard that X has been crushing on her, and that she’s free to make her own choices about dating him, but before she should do so she should know the kind of person he really is. I then tell her the truth about what he did to me, sprinkling in some old screenshots I’ve saved just for this occasion. I make sure to include that it’s entirely possible he may have changed, but should they date she should look out for those warning behaviors. I ask her to please not share any of the information I’ve given her, as he could still tell my mother many of the thing she threatened to before (not that she would believe him). 

So far, I’ve done this with 4 girls. None of them have ever said anything, and all of them have unexpectedly stopped talking to him out of nowhere (according to the mutual friend). He posts on social media all the time about how he can never get a date, and occasionally rants about how women are so picky and choosy and always flake out halfway through a flirtatious relationship. 

It may seem over the top, but the sexual abuse I suffered through has deeply affected me, and I fully intend to make sure he can never get a date again. Take that, bitch. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who is responding, and to whoever gave me gold! For those of you who haven’t seen it in the comments: I did report it to the police. I was punished for having sexual intercourse on campus, because according to authorities, I “consented to everything” when i consented to dating. I was 14 when this happened. It was my first relationship that lasted more than a month. For all of you who say I should have left and told my mother everything: I was 14, and just as most 14 year old girls, my relationship with my mother was tumultuous at best. I was scared and alone and didn’t want to lose my only support system. X unfortunately took pictures of me naked without my consent while I was unconscious (from him smashing my head against a wall) and has threatened to show her multiple times. Now that I’m 3 years older, my mother does know all of the details of the situation, but I would still prefer that she doesn’t see my broken, bleeding, naked body. We have a very good relationship, and despite her support the authorities still won’t do anything. Nothing about this has to do with jealousy, as I’m currently blissfully happy in a very healthy and loving relationship. My only reason for this is a desire to prevent the same things from reoccurring and to protect the other girls who could be entering the situation I escaped from.

2017-11-13 08:32:08+00:00,2496,Don't deliver our order? Feel the wrath of redial,Tinyriiiiicckkk,"Edit: i feel i should prefix this story by saying that yes, i know i went over the top. I am aware. I do feel guilty but i was fed up with this person and the shit he was stirring. Take it as you will. 

We get fresh produce deliveries every day for customers to buy in our store. Things like bread, eggs, milk. etc. Edit: for the people who commented about it - it does include grapes and figs, nuts, tea, whatever. It fits under the fresh produce tag at work.
It's supposed to come every day at 9am. Recently the delivery dude has been taking his sweet time, arriving at 1-2pm with no excuse. Boss won't do shit about it and we have to deal with angry customers every day.
We have the delivery driver's mobile number on hand to call but he usually either lies to us or doesn't answer his phone. The latter is more likely.

I hd enough of this shit so I picked up the store phone and dialed him up. No answer. That's fine. I hang up and call again. No answer.
There's no customers and I am bored so I continue this.
I continue for over an hour. I know he has his phone with him so he must be listening to his phone go off nonstop for that hour, or if he has his phone silenced, has to deal with our number pretty much blocking his line and disrupting his phone use.

Eventually he picks up and yells at me to stop. I yell back that I won't till the delivery is here.
Lo and behold it's there 15minutes later. Which means that he was close by. We realise he probably has been stopping off either at his home which is close by or the local pub. The latter is much more likely.

So I continue to do that every day for a week, repeatedly calling him. All it takes if for the phone to be in speaker and for me to hit redial every time it times out. Easy to do when I'm balancing the books and putting through orders/paperwork.

Eventually we notice that the deliveries are coming much more on time. It took 8 days of pure redialling to get this fucker to do his job. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7cltdv/dont_deliver_our_order_feel_the_wrath_of_redial/,pettyrevenge,182,0.0
2017-11-12 18:25:19+00:00,2134,"""You missed a spot""",Potato_Jello,"For preface, this happened yesterday. I work as a busser for a restaurant, we'll call it Olige Varden, a nice Italian returant. Anyway, every year they give away free meals to Veterans who come in on Veterans day. This draws a pretty big crowd. 

The restaurant is packed. Atleast a 20 party wait list. With 4 bussers bussing over 70 tables, my job was very hectic yesterday trying to turn tables fast to get people serviced quickly. The bar area has 6 booths, and these are seat yourself, first-come-first-serve, so you know people are diving into them as soon as the last party stands. 

This older couple (50s 60s) grabs the booth before I can be called on my headset. Whatever, it's happened alot today, no big deal. I get to the bar section, grab my tray and tray stand and hastily move to clear the table. I'm clearing off the table, say some greetings / apologies ""Sorry about that guys"" "" Be done in a sec"" ""Happy Vets day"", grab everything off, wipe it down, get out from kneeling on the booth bench, and then the older woman hits me with it.

""You missed a spot. There's some crumbs over there."" 

I'm fairly certain there weren't any crumbs. But I took her word for it. ""Ok ma'am, lemme wipe it down again for you."" I got back into that booth, and boy did I clean it. Left, right, up, down, semicircles, full circles, wax on, wax off, I cleaned that table like it was my job (which it is). I spent nearly 2 minutes wiping that table down with my rag (It's longer than it sounds). 2 full minutes I made that crone stand there and watch me as I defiled that table's lacquer by the masterful strokes of Olige Vardens finest. That table was my canvas, and I was a petty Bob Ross. 

The table's waitress finally came by and told me that was fine so I got up and went back to helping clear the other 69 tables for the other 200 guests.

2017-11-11 11:44:37+00:00,7678,Busy body neighbour. Thinks she's the parking police.,bare_face,"I have a busy body neighbour that lives across the street from me. We live in small rural English village. The houses are old and quite tightly packed together with a narrow road running through the centre of the village thats just big enough for 2 cars to pass. 

My house has no parking or driveway so I have to park my car on the road, as do a lot of the other residents. Mrs Busy Body has a big house with enough space on her driveway for 3 cars and a fancy electric gate with a remote control. The driveway is quite narrow as it runs down the side of her house. 

In the village we all try to park on the same side of the road so that people going through don't have to weave in and out of the parked cars and it's safer for children. This means I park opposite my house outside Mrs Busy Body's. 

One morning getting into my car and going to work she came out of her house and told me that I wasn't to park there anymore. I asked her why and her response was ""oh, you know how it is you just want to be able to park your own car outside your own house"". I said yes, I did understand that feeling and raised an eyebrow at the irony of me doing exactly that, albeit on the opposite side. I was just trying to be courteous by parking on the same side of the road as everyone else, but she didn't see it that way. 

I have 1 tiny car and she has 2 large 4x4s and a driveway. I spoke to another neighbour and she'd been bad mouthing ""whoever had the little white car parked outside her house"" as she wanted the space outside just in case someone popped round to visit and needed somewhere to park. 

So I parked my car right outside my front door - directly opposite her driveway.  Now there was no way that her or her husband could get in and out their driveway in one manoeuvre due to the narrowness of the road, the narrow drive, their big range rovers and my car opposite. I watched her for months having to shuffle shuffle her car in and out of her driveway. 

She couldn't say anything to me and ask me to move ""because you know how it is, you just want to be able to park your own car outside your own house"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7c7z89/busy_body_neighbour_thinks_shes_the_parking_police/,pettyrevenge,220,0.0
2017-11-09 20:04:11+00:00,3584,Never Shovel The Shared Driveway? Have Fun Digging Out Your Cars!,Winterwolfe,"A few year ago I rented a home with some friends. Two homes shared the same driveway, both homes owned by the same landlord. The driveway had a common entrance, then forked left for my home, right for the other home to the respective parking areas. 

It was a snowy region. Yet after each snowstorm, we failed to ever see a hint of the neighbors. Two people lived in that home. They used their cars, but only after the driveway was cleared by us. We had to clear it to get our own cars out, so we couldn't let the snow sit while we waited for them to act. 

I think our neighbors thought us quite reliable. We knocked on the door when we knew they were home to ask for a hand, the door was never answered. And left a few notes in the mailbox. If they had some invisible disability, to let us know and we'd not ask for help shoveling again. We were ignored. Didn't complain to the landlord with something so trivial. Many snowstorms came and went, without a single shovelful moved by our lazy neighbors. They probably were even fined for not removing snow from the sidewalk in from of their house, while we kept ours clear and salted.

A blizzard rolled in. It took my housemates and I a monumental amount of time to clear the snow, it was deep, the heavy wet snow. Again, we sought assistance from the neighbors, but were ignored. Thus, we went to work with our petty revenge plan. All the snow in the driveway wasn't merely moved out of the way. It was purposefully brought over to our neighbor's parking area. I'm unsure of how much snow we moved. We certainly made more work for ourselves bringing it to the cars. But it was a significant amount of snow in the end. Their vehicles disappeared under the enormous mound. It was beautiful! If only freezing rain had added a nice, iced crust to make it even more radiant and difficult to remove. 

Needless to say, neighbors were pissed. We kindly answered their angry knocks. Listened to the ranting and seething. We merely shrugged our shoulders and said we'd have appreciate help several snowstorms ago, which would have prevented such an act. They left, complained to their landlord (who seemed somewhat impressed we put up with it for so long and merely reminded them snow removal was a tenant responsibility). 

Each snowstorm after that, when our shovels began to scrape the pavement, the neighbor's silently, grudgingly came out to help. We didn't make them do it alone, but having more bodies to move snow made it a much faster, easier job for all. We earned a small, petty victory for the rest of the long, snowy winter!

2017-11-08 20:21:31+00:00,9291,Cut Off and Vaguely Threaten My Wife? Enjoy five years of being slightly delayed from going home.,EQandCivfanatic,"Five years ago, my wife and I started new jobs in a new city, right down the road from each other's offices, employed with the same government agency. Our schedules were roughly similar for several months before she went to a night shift, so we would occasionally encounter the same people or vehicles in our commute. The commute consisted mostly of two lane roads with no passing.

One day, my wife gets cut off by a fancy black sports car with a vanity plate (Let's say DICKLAW). He had been tailgating her for nearly ten minutes already, as she had the nerve to only go five miles per hour over the speed limit on a busy downtown road. So, the moment he could, he cut into the other lane and passed her, giving her maybe only a foot or two of space after doing so, and forcing her to hit the brakes suddenly in response. She honked her horn at him justifiably in response. To her surprise, Dicklaw stopped his car in front of her. Dicklaw gets out of his vehicle and is an older balding male in a fancy tailored suit. He starts marching towards my wife's much cheaper car shouting and ranting with his fists balled up, and he hit her car a couple times. Thankfully, it didn't get worse, because my wife stayed in her car and already had her phone out calling 911. Incidentally, that's also her place of employment at the time, and she was wearing a uniform which bears a bit of a resemblance to a sworn officer's uniform. Dicklaw apparently notices all this (apparently also taking note of her name tag) after putting a crack in her windshield and immediately heads back to his car and drives off.

About a month later, my wife ends up having to talk to Internal Affairs. A prominent member of the legal community made an official complaint against her for ""reckless driving"" and ""aggressive behavior."" IA thankfully is run by some awesome people, and we had the physical damage to her vehicle that we photographed, a partial recording of his shouting from the 911 call, and the responding officer's report. The complaint was dismissed as unfounded. Due to Dicklaw's prominent status as an attorney locally for almost thirty years, nothing more could come of it legally.

My wife moved to night shifts and my own schedule adjusted slightly, and I was working a typical 9-5, heading from an office along mostly the same route that my wife followed. Lo and behold, I soon discover that with my adjusted hours, I was leaving from the same parking garage as Dicklaw every day of the week at the same time. For the past nearly five years, I waited for him almost every day of the week, and made sure to drive home in front of him at *exactly* the speed limit. This easily extended his home commute time by five to ten minutes each day, depending on how much other traffic was on the road. He tried tailgating me, changing his hours that he was at the office, and multiple other ways to escape this delay in getting home, but thanks to an accomplice in his office, I never had a problem learning his schedule or what vehicle he was driving when he sold his old one. During times when I would take a vacation, I had comrades from my department take up the mantle of driving slowly home to inconvenience this guy. I've gone through three cars in the ensuing time frame, but he never seemed to want to make a confrontation of it. 

As of three months ago, I moved to a new office building and Dicklaw retired shortly after. The saga has ended, and I can only assume he's off to enjoy a retirement of kicking babies or whatever it is lawyers do in their free time. It was a good run, and would always fill me with satisfaction at the end of each day, no matter how much crap I may have faced. 

TL;DR: Achieved stress free living by inconveniencing a lawyer for the past five years.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold! Apparently this was deleted at some point while I slept. Not really sure what that was about. So let me address some questions I've received. There's always doubters, but some actually raised some good points that require clarifications.

1. My wife is not a big fan of confrontation. She only agreed to this particular scheme because it seemed petty enough that it couldn't really escalate into other trouble. 

2. I did not have a CIA spy network of co-conspirators. I have a friend at his office who plays DnD with me on some weeknights and two coworkers who love pranks. That's all I needed to get this done.

3. I really don't feel like I wasted my time. My wife sleeps during the day, and every afternoon when I get home I wake her up just by coming in the front door. Spending this extra time each day doing something fun and relaxing just became part of my day to day activity, like brushing my teeth or taking a shower. It became a habit. Also please note the ""almost every day"" of the above. Clearly there were days when he didn't go to work, or when I had to call in sick (at one point I had to take a full month off due to complications from a surgery, and I couldn't get coverage for that). It was not a perfectly executed plan every day for five years, just almost. 

4. In regards to the windshield: Under Florida statute, windshield replacements have zero deductible, and therefore was at no cost to us. I never noticed any further increase in our insurance. Sometimes even Florida does things right, even with Lord Voldemort as governor.

2017-11-07 15:09:25+00:00,5773,About that time off...no.,gfjq23,"It is that time of year for shift changes because the holidays are approaching and everyone wants time off. I have seniority on holidays, but all my family is in town and I don't have kids, so I don't mind trading. The last 8 years I have traded the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and New Years Eve when asked. Plus, I am usually on call because other co-workers leave town. One employee, who  I will call Jerkface, is usually the one I trade with as he goes out of town with his kids to the grandparents house eight hours away. 

Recently, a promotion opportunity came up and Jerkface and I both applied. I got the job. Jerkface has been bad mouthing me behind my back saying I didn't really deserve the job and must have flirted my way to the position, when in reality he wasn't qualified (doesn't have any of the industry certs needed) and he has dropped the ball on so many projects he wasn't even in the running. I get it, you're jealous Jerkface. Whatever. I am happy enough to ignore his rumor mongering. 

Yesterday, our secretary started putting up the shift trades and I noticed Jerkface had traded with me for Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve without asking. I told the secretary there must be some sort of mistake because I didn't authorize a trade and was planning to take those days off. She called Jerkface from his office and he said he always gets those days off, so I must be joking. I said I was not. Jerkface told me I didn't deserve my time off as much as he does because ""family time is more important to him."" So my husband, parents, sister, BIL, and nieces are not important to me? Game on.

We went to talk with boss man. Jerkface was an ass saying how I always switched with him because I don't care about the holidays nor do I need them, so we should make this switch permanent. I said I don't mind covering for people, but i have covered for the last 8 years and was looking forward to a break. Boss man reiterated that by my generosity only, Jerkface has had all holidays he wanted off for all of his five years of employment and that I was due my turn this year. It was also pointed out that Jerkface has never been on call during the holidays and so this year would be his turn for fairness. Boss man smiled at me, said to enjoy my well-deserved time off, asked Jerkface to stay behind, and had me close the door on my way out. 

Point. Set. Match.

TL/DR; Jerkface tries to steal my holidays, but I steal them back and my cold heart grew three times that day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7bdr00/about_that_time_offno/,pettyrevenge,170,0.0
2017-11-06 01:29:11+00:00,3896,Don't Play Your Stereo Too Loud - You Could Blow a Fuse,Renceward,"I moved into a first-floor apartment in a new 8-unit apartment building. Shortly after I moved in, the guy in the apartment above mine acquired a mega stereo.  This was the 80s when stereos were all about huge speakers and massive sub-woofers.  Of course, he wasn’t going to waste all that stereo goodness by playing his music at a reasonable volume.  When he played it, he blasted it.   Since I lived right below his subwoofer, everything in my apartment would rattle and shake.  It was like being in a perpetual earthquake.  

After a couple of days, I went up and asked if he could turn the music down a bit.  He basically told me to go to hell.  The management company was notorious for not getting involved in tenant conflicts, and the police in town, largely ignored noise complaints.  

One night he cranked the volume at 3am.   Sleep was out of the question so as I lay awake, I hatched my plan.  My apartment was right next to the utility room with all the breaker boxes for the building.  I went in, found the box for his apartment, and flipped the breaker for his living room.  Silence.  

I think it took him until the next day to learn where the breaker boxes were.  It was mid-day before his stereo fired up, once again at full volume.  After a few minutes, I flipped the breaker again.  This time he was down resetting it, only he returned to his apartment and played it at a more reasonable volume.  For the next couple of weeks, whenever the volume got excessive, I flipped his breaker.  

I know that a breaker looks different when it has popped as opposed to being manually flipped, but apparently, he didn’t.  It became clear that he thought that playing his stereo too loud was popping the breaker.  Over the next couple of weeks, I was able to train him into what was a reasonable volume level for his stereo but flipping the breaker every time it got too loud.  He soon learned what volume levels would avoid “popping” the breaker and my apartment stopped shaking.

2017-11-03 23:47:33+00:00,2777,Neighbors come together.,BoredsohereIam,"This story involves my house, two  houses on either side, and most of the street behind us. The lady next to me is the aggressor and shall be called Q for QUIET! Im M for me, ... are uninvolved houses, and the neighbors will be labeled as numbers.

..1 2 3 4 5 6....

.......7 Q M 9 10

Q loves to call the cops for noise. ALL THE TIME. 3 has a few friends over, 7 plays guitar, anyone playing music at all, any of the 5 households with dogs barking, poor fucking 4 trying to beat the nuts off a flat tire in a blizzard and she calls the cops. They told her stop, charged her some fine apparently, all this bullshit so she just stands on her poarch and mean mugs people then screams QUIET! if you make eye contact.
 
9 and 3 came over one day to tell me the plan. Every one was fed up with Q and wanted to legally retaliate. They looked up all the sound law bullshit in my area and asked me to be loud at certain times (like 12-1pm and 10-11pm or something I think). With all of us taking 1 or 2 hours we had stuff going the entire time it was allowed. Weekends we added an hour. It was an amusing few days

Then she called again saying we threatened her and vandalized her property. Totally false but it's something the cops would respond to. So they talked to everyone, figured out it was bs, smirked at our retaliation, and left. Another few more days of ""sound shifts"", 3 4 and 7 said Q resorted to throwing small rocks from her yard. 4 had video, 7 had video and a mark where it hit him. Boom.

One detailed police report later we made a deal with Q to not press charges if she would stop freaking out about noise. She agreed, we ended the shifts, and she stopped being as ridiculous (go a second past the allowed time and she's on it though).

2017-11-02 16:40:41+00:00,3655,Revenge is a dish best served spicy hot,cigar_dude,"I work in an office, as do most people, and of course there is one of many break rooms, as found in most offices.  For the past 2 weeks my wonderful girlfriend would slow cook awesome meals to take to work with me.  We have a giant twin door refrigerator in the break room where everyone keeps their food, no surprise.  Well, like a kid going to recess I walk towards the break room and open the refrigerator.  Food is missing.  I scan around the break room and see my plastic food container on the counter next to the sink.  My heart sank and I reluctantly drove in lunch time rush hour to the quick taco restaurant.  

Next day I bring my food to work.  I keep checking the break room to see if my food is still in there.  This time at lunch my food was in the refrigerator.  I felt sort of relieved and thought that it was an isolated incident.  Until the next day when I brought in some chicken tenders from Publix.  Go into the refrigerator and gone.  Looked in the trash can and there was my chicken tenders container.  I was so mad that I talked with security to see if they could play back the footage.  Since it was more of a nuisance than a crime, security just laughed and said ""sucks to be you man all we can say.""

This occurs over the course of two work weeks.  At least I accumulated enough stamps for a free taco at the quick taco restaurant.  Over the weekend while fishing on the beach I couldn't help but thinking about the jerk stealing my food.  Then it hits me, I wanna play a gaaaame.  

On Sunday I purchased a 6 inch chicken tender sandwich from Publix and took it home.  For those of you who don't know I am a chili head.  Basically I love my food extra spicy.  I've built up a tolerance to where tabasco is like table salt for me now.  I mainly enjoy Carolina Reaper and Bhut Jolokia hot sauces.  

At home I opened up my ""medicine cabinet.""  I carefully opened the sandwich and picked my blood.  I needed something slow acting since I didn't want just a one bite ""hey that's spicy.""  NO!  I wanted this to build and then knock him down.  So I picked one sauce containing the Bhut Jolokia and Moruga Scorpion chili peppers.  Both were at one time considered the hottest peppers in the world by Guinness Book.  The sauce is a great sauce, it slowly builds up with a nice peppery flavor almost like chipotle tabasco if you multiply it by like a thousand.  I used a lot of it but it was worth it, but I wasn't done.  HAHA!!!  NO!  I took out some dried reaper and ghost chilis rom the refrigerator which I use for chili and jarring pickles.  I cut them up into fine pieces using latex gloves, eye goggles, and a mask.  Then I sprinkle them onto the sandwich.  I woke up the next morning and took the sandwich with me.  The girlfriend got irritated because she made me lunch and saw me bringing a sub to work.  Didn't matter because I was about to get revenge.  I took extra care to place the sub right at the front of the refrigerator.  I keep checking the break room every so often to see if it is gone or still there.  Finally at around 10:50 I head towards the break room and I hear a heavy breathing like a dog panting loudly and hear the sounds of shoes squeeking almost like somebody was playing basketball.  Then I go in and see Reuben (not his real name but let's call him that) sweating heavily, stumbling down the counter, and breathing up a hurricane.  He resembled a fish out of water on a hot sidewalk.  I point towards him and say ""YOU! You're the mother***er stealing my damn lunch!""

He looks towards me and says ""wa-wa-water water.""  

I was more than happy to bring him water because as any chili head will tell you water only intensifies the burn!  He gulps all of the water down and then hangs his head over the sink with a stream of drool leaving his mouth.  He looked like Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction.  Then the best thing happens.  The chicken tender sandwich comes right up and lands on the break room floor.  Someone comes into the break room and thinks he's choking and then I say ""no no no he's not choking, he's drunk.""

At this point he's literally at a loss for words.  Then I go back to my desk and he comes up to me in a sweat stained shirt and starts cussing me out.  Only thing I said was ""yeah?  Maybe you shouldn't have kept stealing my lunch then this wouldn't have happened.""

Then he tries to get me in trouble with my supervisor!  He tells my supervisor that I tried to poison him!!!!  I explain the situation to my supervisor who didn't necessarily agree with my actions but I could tell that a piece of him thought that it was justified.  I felt satisfied and relieved.  I didn't even mind going to that quick taco restaurant to buy food.  Later at home I went to the beach, cracked open a cold one, and sipped to victory.

2017-11-01 17:19:46+00:00,7757,Stop stealing my assigned parking space.,Jeheh,"I wasn’t sure if this was petty revenge or malicious compliance but put it here as seemed better.  A little long I think. But good I hope.  

I used to work at a large car dealer and everyone was given assigned parking.  The women usually got the first few rows as the lot could be a little dark and scary during the winter so consequently the guys got the rows up against the fence further away.  No big deal.  

Any my spot ended up being way down in the back corner and that was fine with me. 

Every now and then I would show up and there was a car in my spot. The problem being that the used car salesmen were trying to hide a car they had prospects over the weekend and didn’t want it sold out from under them until they could show up on their next shift.  If they worked Sunday they usually had Monday off.  Salesmen being salesmen they would steal a sale from their brother to make a buck but that’s another issue.  

So they would hide cars in employee parking and then the person who’s spot they stole would have to find another spot usually at the last minute and sometimes they would be a dick and just take someone else’s assigned spot. But that’s not the issue.  

For some reason they seemed to take my spot a lot.  The first couple times I went to HR and told them and they said they would pass it on but it still happened 4-5 times a month and I was getting tired of it.  

On a bright and early Monday I came in and sure enough there was a used car in my spot and I was in a particular mood.  So I grabbed the keys to the tow truck and moved the car way out onto the service lot and dumped into the area our body shop used  to store cars waiting for parts.  I put the truck away and then parked my truck, a fine 75 IH Scout in the spot and went to work.  

A few hours later a salesman came looking for the car and after only finding my Scout was asking who owned said Scout and finally found me.  

He wanted to know where his car was and I played stupid.  I asked him where was it parked and made him take me to where he last saw it.   He said right here and pointed to my space with my Scout in it.  I said I don’t know this is employee parking it shouldn’t be here any way someone must have moved it, you should go see HR or your manager and complain to them, and I walked off.  I assume he found it because I didn’t see him again. 

Next Monday the same thing happened but this time I towed the car and parked it across the street on another dealers lot ( I knew the manager there and he said it was fine). I returned the tow truck and went back to work.  

A few hours later another salesman was back in my face looking for his car.  I told him the same thing I have no idea what you are talking about and I went back to work.  

A few hours after that HR, the Used Car Manager and the salesman show up in my bay looking for the same car from earlier.  

So the manager and HR started asking me were the car was and I asked them to show me where it was parked.  We asked down to the lower lot and he pointed to my spot with my Scout sitting it and said it was right here.   

I asked him So it was parked right here in MY ASSIGNED PARKING PLACE and now it’s gone. 

He said it was parked right here. And I added in MY spot, I just want to confirm that.  YES IN Your spot.  Getting annoyed with all of this.     I asked why are you getting pissed at me your “Kids” pointing at the sales guy keep parking  them here, it’s my assigned spot and I’ve been dealing with for months.   He responds I’ll deal with that, Where’s the Fucking car?

I said parked across the street at Friendly Dealers.  WTF. How did it get there. — I towed it. Hilarity and anger ensued and I went back to work.  HR said please don’t do that anymore come see me first.  

All was fine for about the next week until the following Monday and sure enough another car is parked in spot.  Pissed I went to see HR and she said she would talk to the manager as soon as he shows.  

Tuesday and the same car is still there.   I though FUCK this and drove my Scout up front and since it had been raining and my roads were all dirt and mud my Scout looked pretty bad I parked it in the Used car managers spot right outside his office and made a point of parking badly and on the curb with mud clumping on the ground and I went to work.  

About 2 hours later when that manager showed up to work I get paged over the intercom “Jeh, please see UCM in his office”

I thought this is going to be good.  I walked in to his office and he points to my Scout. Is that yours?  Yes.  Why is it parked there ? 

Because even after last weeks incident with the towed car your kids have parked in my spot AGAIN. So every time they park a car there I’ll park here.  

H - Well you need to move your car.  
M - I can’t my spot is occupied.  
H - it can’t stay there.  
M - well it’s going to until your kids move that car.  And every day from now on if there is a car in my spot I’m parking here.  
H - Who the fuck do you think you’re talking to? Move the car or I’ll get it towed.  
M - WTF is your problem? This is all your fault for not dealing with like a manager.  You want to play that way, I’ll move my Scout but before I do look at the rear number on that thing.  
H - so what
M - it’s a nice big steel bumper and what I’ll do is just back into my spot and if there is anything in my way I’ll just push it backwards, how does that sound?
H - you can’t do that 
M - well get off your lazy ass and tell your people to stop hiding cars in my fucking spot I’m tired of doing this.  My car stays until your car moves.    

And I walked out.  

I get back to my bay and about 10 min later, I hear over the loudspeaker “Jeh please see General Manager  In His office immediately”

I walk into the GMs office and the used car manager and HR are both there.  The UCM looks pissed and HR looks amused.  

The GM ask what’s going on.  

I told him. I spoke to the salesmen and asked nicely, I spoke to HR and told her what’s going on and I’ve spoken to Commander douchebag a few times and about his people parking cars in my assigned parking so I started parking in his spot when his people park there.  

He shakes his head, asks the UCM if this is the case and he starts to yammer and the GM just holds his hand up and says stop.  He looks to HR and asks and she said this has happened 

The GM asks can you please move your car and I’ll settle this.  I closed the door and could hear the GM reaming the UCM through a closed door 30 feet away.

He has an ex who is in his group of friends and hangs out with them. Now, she wasn't dating my ex immediately before me. They dated back in high school, dont know what grade but about 3-6 years ago, and they've dated other people afterward.

Apparently she doesn't like me because I'm dating the person she was with in high school, and this threatens her I guess because idfk girls are fucking insane.

I've been planning a Halloween Party since the beginning of the month and invited all of my SO's friends, including her. By OCT 17th, I messaged everyone again to confirm on who is coming to the party. Nobody answered back until my SO's friend, D, messaged me saying that SO's ex just decided to throw a Halloween party herself. Specifically on the same date and time as mine, and specifically invited the people I invited to my party.

This bitch.

I was pretty steamed at first. But then I started plotting. I was planning on making a lot of good food for the party. Lots of Halloween themed foods. I started posting on FB all the goodies I was gonna cook up. Chocolate-covered popcorn balls, Candy Apples, Ribs, Cookies, Cupcakes, all that jazz. That's when people started messaging me that would definitely be there. A lot of people messaged me. I now have pretty much a full house for the party.

Its the day of Halloween, my party, and she messaged SO's friend, D, this morning. She told him she decided to cancel her party for tonight because nobody was gonna show up. She also asked him to ask me if she could still come to my party because for some reason she's too embarrassed or something to ask me after trying to pull that shit. 

I told her sorry, I had way too many people I couldn't possibly invite another.

2017-10-30 02:00:35+00:00,4659,"Slow burn revenge on ex, which I'll sadly never witness.",ChewbaccaTheRookie,"Firstly, a bit of background.  My Ex (I'll call her Diva, since it's both close to her actual name and an accurate description of her personality) broke off our relationship a few months ago.  It was all very amicable at first, until I found out that she'd been cheating on me with another guy for several months.  After that, I told her exactly what I thought of her (at some length) and cut off all contact with her.  Life moves on, better off single, plenty more fish in the sea, etc etc...  
It's important to note at this stage though, that Diva has a MASSIVE ego and makes a point of being condescending and patronising to anyone whom she feels is beneath her (imagined) social status.  Think Narcissistic Personality Disorder level of arrogant. As much as I loved her, she could be insufferably embarrassing to be around at times.  Anyway, I digress.

Fast forward to yesterday.  I'm in Costco, doing a major shopping run to stock up the freezer etc.  I get into the queue for the checkout and realise I've dropped my membership card somewhere in the store.  Without it, I can't pay.  I park my trolley and go to Customer Services, explain the situation to a member of staff and ask if anyone has handed in my card.  She says no, but even if it had been returned, store policy is to destroy the card. However, they can issue a new one on the spot if I have I.D. on me.
Luckily I was carrying my driving licence, so all was well.

As the staff member was sorting out my details, we realised that my address hadn't updated when I moved house earlier in the year.  As she's updating the details, she asks ""And is this the same address for Diva...""?

I'd completely forgotten that my ex had a card on my membership.  In the back of my mind I remembered that we could save money when I renewed my membership details by putting her on my account and cancelling her own account. Oh, happy days...

With a bright, happy smile I asked the very helpful young lady to cancel Diva's card, as she won't be needing it any more.

Next time she goes to Costco, she'll stick to her usual routine and spend a MINIMUM of two hours stocking up everything for months in advance, only for her card to be declined when she gets to the checkout.  In front of lots of people.

I'm only sorry that I won't be there to see it happen in person, and I preemptively apologise to the poor staff member who will inevitably bear the brunt of Diva's embarrassment.  However, the thought of her standing at the checkout in enraged impotence will keep me warm at night for weeks to come.

2017-10-29 13:36:47+00:00,3029,Think price is too high - have some more,big_j_400,"I worked as a project manager for an IT company supporting and improving customer software.  

Special snowflake customers have a few tricks when they don't like prices for the improvements they request (which require high level design, then pricing).  Mostly they just say ""That seems a bit expensive, can you check to see if it can be reduced by &lt;some percentage&gt; then we can proceed"".  (The other common one is to remove requirements from the design, then raise faults on the delivered system that it doesn't do whatever it was that was removed, and management often gets it added in under warranty).   Account managment would let them get away with this, making the people doing the design and pricing look like we are not effective at our jobs.

One particular customer got so bad that we started padding the quotes by their usual percentage, so that when their ""please remove"" was applied it came to the estimated amount.  (not the revenge bit).

Eventually, I made it to the Account Management level for this particular customer.  First piece of product pricing comes through to me, I ask the PM if it has been padded (which it has). I remove it, to their concern. 

Customer asks if it can be checked to see if it can be done cheaper.  I wait a day, and present the design back, with an INCREASE of the requested reduction.  When they queried the increase, I explained that the ""recheck of the design and pricing"" was additional effort that now needs to be covered by the project work, so that has been rolled into the reviewed price.  If they weren't happy, i could get it checked again, but that would require additional effort that would need to be recovered.  They stopped asking for discounts after a couple of rounds of that.

In the city in which I worked, my partner and I staffed one of 3 ambulances. The majority of the people I worked with were cool, but there was one girl, also a paramedic, who was just awful. We shall call her Bertha. Besides being a disgusting person, Bertha had a repulsive personality and dog shit paramedic skills. I routinely heard stories about how she was deragatory and even abusive toward her partners, and how many people refused to work with her because they didn’t want their names associated with her patient care reports. Bertha was a compulsive liar and also seemed to think she was everyone’s supervisor. Of the 3 ambulances, she worked on #1, and I worked on #3 - opposite sides of town. So I fortunately didn’t have to cross paths with her often. 

One day, Bertha picked up a shift on ambulance #3. I came into work the next morning to relieve her. At shift change, she explains to me that the supervisors are cracking down on crews for not maintaining appropriate par levels of inventory on the rigs. I’m like okay, whatever, I don’t see how this affects my station or the crews that work here because we are very diligent on making sure our ambulance is appropriately stocked. She tells me she did a top to bottom thorough inventory of the rig, and adjusted the par levels according to the inventory sheet issued by supervisors. She then holds out a black plastic trash bag with medical supplies in it, and says “your ambulance was overstocked, so I took off the surplus inventory for you because I would hate for you to get in trouble with a supervisor.” I look in the bag, and there’s gauze and band aids and rolls of tape, some oxygen tubing and IV tubing. I looked at her like umm seriously? And she says “well the inventory list says there should be 5 bandaids in the trauma cabinet. You had 8, so I had to take the extra inventory off. I mean, I don’t make the rules around here. I just don’t want you to get in trouble for having extra tape and gauze...” I’m thinking to myself, this bitch is unreal and she has some nerve to come into my station and pull shit like this. But whatever. She leaves for her shift on ambulance #1, I get to work checking my rig.

As I’m checking out my equipment, I notice she has switched around the location of supplies in the medical bag and the EKG monitor. I had to do some digging to find certain equipment that was important, and should be readily available in an emergent situation, like our BVM and 12 lead cables. This made me even more irritated with Bertha’s controlling and manipulative crap. Then, that afternoon, the icing on the cake was a phone call from a supervisor, asking if everything was alright. He said he had gotten a phone call from Bertha saying there was an issue with the inventory on the ambulance and she had followed it up with documentation writing up the crews of ambulance #3 for inappropriate par levels. At this point, I’m fucking fuming. The supervisor laughed at the write up, knowing what a piece of shit employee Bertha is, and said he just wanted to give me a heads up on what a snake she was being. 

Several weeks go by, and things are per usual around the station. Then one day I get an overtime shift on ambulance #1 - Bertha’s station. I relieve her in the morning. She’s not friendly in the least bit toward me. After she leaves, I do my rig check. And in the med bag, I find a dirty/used IV catheter, a dirty IV needle, and a dirty lancet. The catheter is a 22g - the tell tale sign of Bertha’s handiwork, since her skills are so shitty she is unable to start IVs with a larger gauge. Just to clarify, the same bitch who sneakily wrote me up for having extra bandaids on my ambulance left dirty sharps floating around the medical bag, free to stick any unassuming person reaching into it. I snapped pictures of it right away and cleaned up her mess. 

The next morning she comes on shift to relieve me. I don’t give her the time of day. She starts checking out her equipment and is all smiles and chirpy with her partner. As I get ready to leave, I said to her “oh hey by the way, when I was going through the bag yesterday morning, I found dirty sharps in there.” She gives me this surprised face and shrugs her shoulders, like ‘oh really? Couldn’t have been me’. I said “there was a 22g cath, needle, and a lancet. And well, you know, I figured I would just tell you about it instead of reporting it to a supervisor because I would hate for you to get in trouble for it.” For a millisecond she relaxes and has this look of relief wash over her. Then I said “just kidding, I wrote that shit up” and walked away. Deuces bitch ✌🏼

So drawing on our faces while we slept was one of their favorites. After they did it for the tenth time my mom got really mad and yelled at them, putting a stop to the markings. But they would find other ways to prank us, like putting duct tape on our legs. 

I wake up one morning and find duct tape around my ankles for the 3rd time and my brother fell out of bed from it. This was starting to get old so we came up with a devious plan. We waited for the next time my sister had her pranking friend over and stayed up all night so they couldn't do anything. Next, just before everyone got up, me and my brother got black markers and scribbled all over our own faces. Fast forward an hour or two and my parents are up with their coffee. We come out with marked up faces and show our mom. Instant anger, she goes to yell at them all while they claim to have not done it.

They barely got punished in the end but the yelling was enough for us and with that the pranking stopped.

I'm 23 now and this came up at a family dinner. My sister brought it up and my mom still didn't believe her! She looked at me like my sister was crazy and I decided to tell her the truth.

2017-10-26 07:46:30+00:00,2929,Taking 2 parking spaces are we .... not TODAY!,TheFailSnail,"I assume we've all seen them before; the cars that are parked in such a way that they take 2 (or something more) parking spaces. This is a little story about this scenario and me in a 'not today' mood.

So, at my last workplace we had a shared parking lot for the 6 or so companies that worked on the property. Sadly, the amount of parking spaces on the terrain wasn't suitable for the amount of people that arrived by car. This meant that if arrived late, you we're out of luck and had to park of property, meaning you had to have a 3 minute (or so) walk to get to the building. The day this 'incident' took place was a rainy day, which probably cause the 'not today' attitude, and when I drove onto the parking lot there was 1 spot left... but not really. The person next to the spot had parked his car over the line dividing the 2 parking spaces, basicly taking up 2 parking spots. I looked at the car, I looked at the weather and I looked at my own car. My own car was a small Volkswagen and was around 127 years old and looked like it was the sole survivor (albeit just) of a destruction derby. ""Ok, you got nothing to lose, just don't hit the car""... I might have actually said that out loud in my car. 

I made the decision to not go for the 3 minute walk and that space left was enough for my car to fit in. It was... barely. I think I've done the best parking I've ever done in that moment, because I managed to fit my car right next to the other car... and by just I mean, I had to turn the rearview mirror on the right side in so it wouldn't hit the car I parked next to. I think I left the generous space of 3 centimeters (approx 1.2 inches) between our cars, which allowed me JUST enough room on the other side to get out on my drivers side. I had to squeeze and all, but I managed.

Now, the good thing about my work spot was that I had an overview of the parking lot and was always one of the later leavers. I didn't know whose car it was that parked like an ass, but I knew I'd find out that day.. and I did :). Apparently the car was from a client of one of the other companies, who happened to leave about 3 hours after I parked my car. When I say, I mean.. ""wanted to leave"". He came out of the building and walked up to his car only to stop around 2 meters from it (odd how people tend to notice stuff like this only when they're close). He walked closer to see if my car had hit his car (I hadn't) and stepped back again. He looked back to the building and back to his car again. There was no way he was going to get into his car the normal way.

It was satisfying to see him consider all options and I think he briefly considered coming back into the building to ask whose car was parked next to him (since he took a step or 2 back towards the building), but then decide there was no other option than to get in from the passengers side. Yea... you don't look so fancy in your 3-piece suit trying to get over to the drivers side while avoiding to have your virginity taken by the handbrake/gearshift. That'll teach you proper parking.. I hope.

Back in the day my dad used to run his business from home. One day, while he was out on a meeting, the phone rang and my mother picked it up. On the phone was a man, asking to talk to my father.

Man: Is *dad* here ? 
Mom: Goodmorning. I'm sorry, I'm afraid he's left. Can I help you? 
Man: No, I just wanted to ask him something, I'll call back.
Mom: Well, you can but I'm sure he would prefer to have me pass along the message, so he can call you back when it's more convenient for him. 
Man: Listen little lady, what I have to talk to him about is quite important, so I'd rather not rely on some secretary. I'll call back. *hangs up*

Later that day, the gentleman called back. My dad had been filled in by my mother, and we were all waiting for that call with excitement. 

Man: Is this *dad*? 
Dad: Hello. Yes, it is him. What can I do for you ?
Man: Hello, I called earlier today, I'm looking to work for your company. Do you hire interns?
Dad: Actually, we do. You called earlier ? When ?
Man: This morning. Your secretary picked up but you were out. 
Dad: Oh, I didn't get any message.
Man: Well, I told her I'd rather deal with the boss. I don't trust secretaries, you see? 
Dad: Oh, I see. Did she tell you she was my secretary ?
Man: Well... No, but I guessed she was. 
Dad: Ah. You see that's funny, because I don't have a secretary. I do, however, have a wife. 
Man: Oh.
Dad: You see, my wife and I talked about it, and realised that we really need to hire a secretary. It'll just be easier for us, you know ? However, we can't afford both a secretary and an intern. Especially an intern who doesn't trust secretaries, it would just be too complicated.
Man: No but I mean I could... 
Dad: No; no don't worry ! I'm sure you'll find something. My wife wishes you the best of luck. So do I. Goodbye now.


And that was the best phonecall I've ever had the chance to listen to. We may have lost the possibility of getting an intern, but it was so worth it. 

**tl;dr** Don't assume any woman you talk to is the secretary. She might just be the boss' wife.

***********
Back when he was a child in 6th or 7th grade, my dad had one of *those* teachers. We all know the one. The teacher whose classroom policy is **""MY WAY. NO HIGHWAY OPTIONS""** (of course this was around 1970, so things were a little different; still, this woman was a piece of work even then), and makes the life of any who dare displease her a living hell. This woman had it through her head that my dad's first name was Ronald. It is not. His legal first name is Ronnie, but he goes by Ron. Anyway, this woman *knew* his name was Ronald, but he was being a smart ass about it.

So my dad eventually started ignoring her when she would call attendance for ""Ronald."" And when she would ask if she had missed anyone, he would quietly raise his hand and announce that she had neglected his name. Inevitably she would ask him why he hadn't responded when she called out Ronald, to which he would reply, in some form or another: ""That's not my name. My name is Ronnie."" She wasn't having this and eventually grew tired of his repeated ""infractions"" and sent him to the principal. The principal was also a hard ass, but once he heard the whole story, just told my dad to answer to Ronald in class so as not to cause any more disruption.

This displeased my dad; he was - and still is - a strong-headed man. So he went home and asked to see his birth certificate. The next day when he went in and the teacher called for Ronald, he did as always and ignored this until the end. Once the teacher finally rounded on him, he stood up and said loudly enough to get everyone's attention (something to the effect of, ""I've told you every day now and you still don't believe me. That's. Not. My. Name. My name is Ronnie, and here is my birth certificate as proof.

Silence. No one had dared stand up to this woman before.

She strutted over and snatched the document out of his hand and her frown turned into a scowl as she read down to the name line, and further down to the official seal. She handed back his birth certificate and didn't say a word to him for the rest of the day. Funny enough, he never had to correct her after that, though he says she would always pause before reading off his name. He never understood why...

A few people brought their SOs with them. No problem. The more the merrier. However, one friend brought his new girlfriend with him. I'll call her Beth (name changed). This was my first interaction with Beth, though I was warned by others that she can be quite irritating. Those warnings were correct. She complained the entire time we were at the beach (""it's too hot,"" ""it's too sandy,"" etc), responded to jokes with a sarcastic ""I don't get it"" response, and was generally rude to everyone. My friends and I normally have a wonderful time together, but Beth was singlehandedly bringing everyone down and making the event uncomfortable. 

At some point, the group started discussing beer and Beth announced that she was Mormon and doesn't drink (relevant). That's normally completely fine and people can do whatever they want, but she was being incredibly indignant about it and even went so far as to end her statement with ""... because I'm actually a GOOD person."" 

Ugh. 

When it was time to eat lunch, I pulled my sandwich out of the cooler, set it on my paper plate, and set the plate on my towel. Then Beth starts walking towards the food and steps right on my plate with her sandy feet. I looked up at her expecting an apology, but she just kind of rolled her eyes and kept walking. She then pulled out her sandwich and started eating, as I walked over to the cooler to see if there was another sandwich available. Nope. Just drinks. 

I looked over at Beth, and she was just sitting there without an ounce of remorse. RUDE. THAT WAS A PUBLIX SUB. YOU DON'T JUST STEP ON A PUB SUB WITHOUT APOLOGIZING. You made me very sad, Beth. However, I noticed that she didn't have a drink and there was only 1 non-alcoholic beverage left in the cooler. Normally, I would leave that for the non-drinker and have a beer. But, I took it back with me to my towel and sipped while I watched her get up, go to the cooler, search for a drink, and go back empty-handed. She complained the entire afternoon about how thirsty she was.

I have one friend that has my password, but she only used it to cover a few dance classes for me— so she doesn’t actually use it on a normal basis.

When I opened it, a pop up came up saying my music was playing on some random Android phone.  I don’t have an Android phone and neither does the person with my password. So I immediately knew someone had figured out how to get into my account. 

I tried a few times to put my own music on as a, “Hey dude, figured you out. Knock it off.” But they kept switching it back to their music. So I changed my password, and they were still somehow connected. So I had to look up how to delete other devices from being able to connect.

While I did that, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to mess with them a bit. They were playing some awful, pseudo-rap music. I can only hope that this person was playing music at some kind of work site and were playing it for multiple people. I thought for a minute and went into my Kinderdance class music.

Today, I reached out and asked about the status of it. Her reply: She lost it. Now I'm unsure whether she genuinely misplaced it (she could be absentminded at times), threw it away out of revenge (she could be spiteful), or is just keeping it. Honestly, after the next exchange, I couldn't care less what the reality was:

Me: Well can you send me some money to replace it?

5 minutes later. Password changed. TFA was already set up to send a code to my phone. All of her devices were untrusted. Have fun buying and restarting everything on that game you love.

Edit: Game was Sims 4.

First off, no reaction from my ex yet. We've been broken up for months now and don't talk at all. If she ever reacts, I'll let you guys know.

Second, regarding the standalone GPS, my mom had it from the mid-00s. She keeps it for road trips to save her phone battery and for signal reasons. Plus it already has(had) addresses of family members in different cities programmed into it. My ex took it because her phone's GPS had failed on her in the past just from local use. She had a carrier that wasn't one of the big 4 and it showed often with her signal randomly dropping. Since she was going to be driving for 3 days, sometimes though sparsely populated areas, and her phone didn't have unlimited data, she wanted something more reliable, so we got my mom's GPS for the trip.

A bunch of us, bride and groom included, decided we wanted to keep the party going after the reception venue closed.

We arrived to the bar en mass and just took over the dance floor. Everyone was drunk and happy and just having a great time.

I asked her if she got a good look at the guy and she points him out.

 At this point I'm just drunk enough and surrounded by friends enough to inflate my courage. My first reaction was to confront him, but my gf didn't want me to cause a big scene to ""protect her honor"" or whatever. I relented to her wishes and started thinking up a way to get this guy back. 

Then it hit me. I bet this asshat wouldnt go around groping women if he got a taste of his own medicine. So I lead my gf back out on the dance floor, without telling her my plan, I take every opportunity to steer us close to this guy and when he's not looking I grab a hand full of dude butt and then proceed to act completely unaware.

He put a ticket on the window but didn't leave which was odd, so we went down to talk to him. Turns out the BMW has ""Liar Liar"" style ticket list (basically allot of tickets if you don't know that movie) so the city official was waiting for a tow truck. After about 30 minutes the BMW was gone. We then decided to call the tenant board about our landlord and how he did seemingly nothing.

I tend to shop pretty quickly and I wasn't really into high end or luxury products anyway so around lunch time I decided to get a bite to eat.

Since I was alone, I asked a fellow Asian if I could sit with her. She just kind of sneered at me and rolled her eyes but didn't say no to me sitting there so I did.

Her friend looked at me then said something to her friend in their language while the other one laughed and rolled her eyes again.

I don't really mind that they are talking in their language. They were entitled to do that but they were both mean and I had an inkling they were talking about me at the start of their conversation. 

Here's where my revenge comes in... based on what I heard, I knew they were Korean since I watch my fair share of Korean TV shows and could pick out a few words. I'm Asian too but I was very obviously not Korean so they assumed I didn't understand them. They were right about that but since I've been to Seoul a number of times, I learned a few phrases while I was there.

As I stood up, in my best Korean accent, I thanked them and said goodbye in Korean. Now, if they hadn't been talking about me, no harm done, right? But based on how wide their eyes got when they looked at me, I knew I caught them. So I just smiled then left, hoping they learned their lesson not to assume people around them don't understand.

TL;DR: Mean girls didn't think I understood their ""secret"" language. I did not but that didn't stop me from thanking them in their language.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7523gw/dont_be_mean_in_another_language/,pettyrevenge,231,0.0

I used to live on the 3rd floor of an apartment that had its laundry in the basement. Which means 4 flights of stairs for me, no elevator, and I have a newborn so I'm washing quite a bit. So we have cubbies in the laundry room for our soap and stuff. I've lived there a year and never had an issue leaving my soap down there. Apparently, some new people had moved in that were using my soap. When I realized it, I left a note asking that they stop. Nothing. They kept using. Okay. Now I'm pissed.

I got 2 bottles of soap. A blue colored one. And clear colored one. Marked the bottles CLEARLY that they belonged to me (so they couldn't accidentally say they thought they were theirs) filled the blue soap with blue Rit dye. Filled the clear soap with unscented bleach. And waited....

Didn't take long. The next morning I hear screaming coming from the laundry room. 4 floors up I heard it. I waited a while and ventured downstairs. In the laundry room I found a bunch of wet clothes in the garbage that were bleach stained. 4 days later I saw a young man get into a car with a blue stained t-shirt.

Touch my fucking stuff.

2017-10-03 19:15:14+00:00,2898,"Tried to push me so hard into a sale, that he pushed me next door",jhxcb,"Alright, I don't know if this is good petty revenge, but it made me feel better.

A few years ago, when I was a very shy person, still starting to grow into adulthood and doing things on my own, I was in need of a new car.  I was finally working a decently paying job and had a second job just for fun.  I did my research, and I was interested in the Chevy Spark, so I did the only sensible thing and went to the Chevy dealership to test drive one.

My BF and I walked in together, but he went off to do his own looking, as it was my car and my decision.  As soon as I was alone, a salesman comes right up to help me.  I tell him that I was looking to test drive a Spark and he leads me to his desk.  He immediately jumps into what my current car is worth, what my credit is like, how much I want to pay, etc.  About halfway through the production, I stop him.  I tell him that I just wanted to test drive the car, and there was no point in trying to figure out the financing if I didn't even know if I'd like it.  He asked me point-blank if I was looking to buy a car that day, and I said I didn't know.  He then just tells me, ""Well, if you're not looking to buy a car today, I don't really want to help you.""  He tells me to wait as he gets up to greet other customers.

Obviously, I didn't wait.  I just got up, found the BF and told him we had to leave.  I'm a little crushed.  My confidence is shaken, and I relay the story to the BF on the way out.  He's fuming but decides to keep his thought to himself.  He suggests we go to the Mini dealership nearby.  Minis are my dream car, so he knew it would cheer me up.

Well, after a little time looking around the show floor, talking to a very nice and helpful saleswoman who didn't bring up financing at all until I did, I signed for a new Mini.  I wasn't picking it up until the final week, so BF was still driving me home.  He took a weird route, and turned back into the Chevy dealership.  He said, ""One second,"" and grabbed some of the papers out of my hand as he went inside.

Apparently, he went in, stormed into the manager's office and put the contract on the manager's desk.  He relayed what the previous salesman said to me and showed her that they missed out on a sale.  He apparently had a history of these events, and the manager said that ""it wouldn't happen again"".

I guess I don't know if anything came of it, but I hope he at least got a good chewing out.

TL;DR Rude, pushy salesman breaks my spirit, and I buy competing car at twice the price.  BF shows contract to manager and gets original salesman in trouble.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/742o05/tried_to_push_me_so_hard_into_a_sale_that_he/,pettyrevenge,283,0.0
2017-10-02 22:36:13+00:00,7162,Annoying the Head of the HOA,lawilde,"A friend of mine not too long ago painted his house. He lives in a development that has an HOA. He admits that he and his wife made the first mistake by not reading the HOA handbook close enough so they didn't realize they had to get the color approved by the HOA.

On the first day of painting, the head of the HOA stopped by and talked to them, made small talk, talked about ways to make painting the house easier etc. At this time the HOA head knew they hadn't gotten the color approved because he sits on the three-person panel that approves the colors, however, he opted not to say anything to them. Instead, he waited until they had the entire house painted then told them the color was not approved because there too many other houses with a similar color (it was a lighter shade of green).

So, faced with having to spend the time and money to repaint the entire house, he and his wife decided to get a little revenge. They submitted the form and color swatch for the new color and were approved. Knowing the panel had to take time out of their lives to meet every time they submit a color, they decided to submit another color swatch and form saying that they had changed their minds. This color was one they knew would never be approved. As assumed, it was denied. They had to submit again and again they submitted a color they knew would never be approved. Again, they were denied. They repeated this 4 or 5 times before the HOA head contacted them and told them the first swatch they submitted was still approved and not to submit another swatch for approval, they were tired of playing games. He replied telling him that it turns out that color is no longer available and they needed to submit one last swatch, which, of course, was a color that they knew would not be approved. This time the HOA told them if they submitted another un-approvable swatch they would be fined and billed for the panel's time. He submitted another swatch that was a color he knew would never be approved and with it a photocopy of the page from the handbook covering the process of getting a color approved. He pointed out that there was nothing in there that mentioned any limit to a number of swatches a person could submit.

This entire process took a few months. After 8 or 9 swatches that were denied, the head of the HOA was fuming mad and showed up at their door telling them he wasn't leaving until they had decided on a color for the house. My friend pointed out that the handbook says the only way for a color to be approved was with a vote from the full panel. The HOA head called the other two people, they came over, and once they were all sat down he and his wife shuffled through about 10 different swatches of crazy colors before finally showing them one that was a light green color. Frustrated, they approved it and left.

A few weeks later, the head of the HOA contacted him to see when they were going to paint and he told them they already had. The swatch that they had approved was the color the house was already painted. A week later he got an angry letter from the HOA and a bill for their time. He refused to pay and will fight it. A couple weeks after that everyone got a revised handbook in the mail with very detailed rules on how to get a color approved. My friend then called the head of the HOA and told him all of this could have been avoided if he had just said something that day when he came over and talked to them as they started painting, but he decided to be a dick, so they decided to be dicks back to him.

TL;DR - HOA head is a jerk to my friend so he and his wife get petty revenge by driving the HOA head and the paint color approval committee crazy.

Edit - Well, this has blown up unexpectantly. Apparently, HOA's are a point of anger for a lot of people. Just a few follow-ups:

1. I'm no expert on the lien/fine situation and how that all plays out. I was just going off something I was told. Apparently, if he doesn't pay the fine they can file a lien against him and they could foreclose on his house. When I told him this he explained that the handbook actually had a detailed procedure on how fines are to be handed out and collected. There are apparently a few steps the HOA has to take before they will file a lien and none of those have happened yet. The fine is $300 so if it escalates to the next step and they try to collect the money he will take action even if that means swallowing his pride and paying. He is going to double check just to make certain they haven't tried to file the lien on the sly.

2. A lot of people are wondering how an HOA comes to be and why anyone would move into one. To make it short, the idea of an HOA is a good one. They help make sure the community stays nice and property values stay up so you don't have neighbors that move in, never cut their grass, have three broken down cars and a couch in their front yard and constantly throw loud parties, driving down your property values. They also often have community-wide benefits like a pool, workout room, etc. The problem is that some people get the slightest bit of power and it goes to their head and they turn into assholes. Based on the replies I have seen here, that seems to happen quite a bit. There are good HOA's. My brother lives in a place that has one that he has nothing but good things to say about, but it seems like there are many that are bad and go too far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/73wb2j/annoying_the_head_of_the_hoa/,pettyrevenge,855,0.0
2017-09-30 21:33:24+00:00,5652,Be a seat hog on the plane? No lunch for you.,tjd_h,"This is my boyfriend's story of petty revenge that I think belongs here. 

My boyfriend and I live overseas and flew back home to visit our families earlier this month. Since I got more time off work than he did, we flew home separately. 

My bf found cheap flights on a budget airline with notoriously small seats and little legroom. The flight time back home is almost 8 hours. 

Bf's flight wasn't completely full, so at the back of the plane where he was sitting there was a smattering of free seats. Most people at the back either had an aisle or an empty seat beside them. 

Unfortunately, my bf was in a section of 3 with no free seats. He had the aisle seat, with an elderly couple sitting in the middle and window seat. Directly across the aisle in the middle of the plane there were 3 free seats. 

As soon as everyone had boarded the plane, a lady a few rows up called the flight attendant over and complained about how uncomfortable she was, and demanded to move into the 3 free seats. The flight attendant told her that no one was allowed to move seats until after the plane had taken off and the seatbelt sign had been switched off. 

A few minutes after takeoff when the seatbelt sign was off, my bf figured he'd take one of the 3 free seats to give the elderly couple beside him more space to be comfy on the long flight. He had just unbuckled his seat belt and started making a move across the aisle when the disgruntled lady a few rows up flung herself into one of the free seats and spread her bags across the other 2, not even waiting to see if anyone else wanted one of the seats (so that she'd be on an aisle with a free seat in the middle and someone else on the other aisle). She pulled out nail clippers, clipped her fingernails, and then started painting them. After that was done she stretched out across the 3 seats and went to sleep. 

The elderly couple saw this happen and commented on how rude it was that this lady didn't give anyone else the chance to take one of the seats, and the two of them and my bf discussed her rudeness quietly amongst themselves. 

A couple of hours later the flight attendants came down the aisle with hot paninis for lunch. Since Ms. Just Got Mah Nailz Did was passed out with her feet sticking out into the aisle, the flight attendants put her panini on the seat back tray instead of waking her up. 

My bf and the elderly couple shared a knowing look, and then my bf stealthily grabbed the lady's panini off the tray. The three of them took her panini out of the plastic wrap, and then divided it up amongst themselves. 

TL:DR: Lady on a transatlantic flight hogs 3 seats to herself instead of allowing someone else to have one of them. Clips and paints her nails, then passes out, so my bf and the people he was sitting with steal her sandwich and divide it between themselves. 

The sweet, toasty spoils of petty revenge.

2017-09-29 18:22:10+00:00,3112,Want to cut in line? You're going to have a crappy day.,JohnZoidberg3016,"This happened a while back, one day after getting off work in the afternoon i decided to stop and get a bite to eat on the way home.  There is a gas station that has a drive thru where you pull around back and order on a touch screen.  Normally the drive thru is very busy but luckily no one is there so I ordered my meal and went to pull around.

No sooner had I started a busted up Buick cut in front of me and pulled up to the window.  I honk my horn which he responds by flipping me off and I listen as he acts like a complete jackass.  From what I understood he wanted to get a pack of Marlboro's and didn't want to wait in the line inside so he just decided to use the drive thru.

Problem is you can't get things like cigarettes and liquor through it and even if you could he just decided to cut in front of people but seeing how he's driving a Buick with primer for a color and sporting a rat tail he'd be the type not to care.  He goes off on the employee getting the manager involved but she didn't want to cause an issue so she decided to help the guy.

She gets his Marlboro's which he proceeds to pay in a handful of change and she asks him next time to get them inside and not to cut in front of the drive thru.  He replies, ""I don't give a shit!"" and takes off, I pull up and the manager profusely apologized and offered to give me my meal for free for waiting patiently.  I went ahead and paid for it anyway because I know how stressful it can be dealing with idiots.

I go to leave and pull out and notice behind me is the busted up Buick turning in the same direction I was.  Don't know what he had been doing that whole time because I thought by now he'd been miles down the road but when I noticed he was going to be behind me I couldn't help but smile.  There is a stretch of rural road with no passing because of how busy it is and speed limit is 40, well I wanted to get safely home so I decided to go 30.

For the first few miles the guy is going crazy, every time I look in the rear view the guy is screaming and all I could do is laugh and just make me more cautious.  Stopping to let people out, slowing down when I see people walking in their yards, basically just using any excuse to go slower.  Oh look a school bus coming out, sure pull out and your going to drop off kids?  Even better.

During the first drop off I look back and the guy is hitting his dashboard and all I could do is laugh manically.  Apparently it got to the guy when on the third stop after the bus retracted their sign I hear an engine roar and Rat Tail peels out behind me and on the other side and passed me and the bus and just narrowly avoided hitting a car head on.  Horns were blaring and before I could react I hear *Woop Woop*.  My eyes widen and I turn to a side road to see a Sheriff's Deputy pull out.

Needless to say I laughed like a hyena and while this was going on I had a call on my phone.  I pulled over into a parking lot and talked to a friend of mine for about 30 minutes.  About 20 minutes into our conversation I noticed a tow truck going down the road but didn't think anything about it, after my phone call I continue my way home.  A few miles down the road I noticed the traffic slowing and saw lights flashing.

I get closer and notice the Buick being pulled up on the back of the wrecker and when traffic stops for a moment I look over into the cruiser and see Rat Tail, in the back in handcuffs.  I couldn't help but smile and as he turned to see me smiling I waved bye to him and continued my way home.

2017-09-27 20:15:36+00:00,3668,Make me walk a mile in the rain? Don’t mind me while I get you fired from your job.,shmatelyn,"Last week my fiancé came to my bar after work and had a few drinks, so he left his car in the parking lot and I drove him home in mine. We have amazing public transportation where we live so we decided to take the express bus back into town where the Operations Center and end of the line of the bus route stops right next to the parking lot of my bar. I took this bus five days a week this last winter when the roads were bad and made friends with all of the drivers. A few of them were nice enough to drop me off right in front of the door to the bar so I didn’t have to walk across a snowy parking lot. They said it was okay because the busses have to refuel after their route and they have to pull a u-turn at the Operations Center anyway, so this way they could just keep driving past the bar and continue on their way to the refueling station. 

So we’re on this bus back into town and there is a new driver I haven’t seen before, but it’s been a few months since I’ve taken the bus so I didn’t think anything of it. I just got on the bus and said “hello!” Before dropping my money in the slot. We make it down into town and we make a routine stop at a transit center when the driver tells us that this is the end of her route and she is now out of service. 

There’s still about two miles left between where we are and the Operations Center, where the actual end of the line should be, and where we need to go. She tells us we can take a different bus to a crosswalk about a mile from the OC and then walk. I got this really big whiff of bullshit, but I didn’t say anything at that point, I just got off the bus and waited fifteen minutes in the rain for another bus. 

A few people who were also on my bus and waiting for the next told me this was the third time she did this to them this last week. Kicked them off her bus and then made them pay another bus fare to go up the street for one mile and then walk. I remembered what the other bus drivers told me about having to pull a u-turn and then go refuel, but if there’s no one on the bus, they can just go directly to the refueling center and avoid the last ten minutes of their route.

This lazy bitch was just kicking people off her bus and making them pay more money and walk so she could get off work ten minutes early!!!!

Here’s the revenge: So as I’m getting on the second bus, I see the phone number for the Operations Center printed on the side of the bus route picture so I call it. I tell them I was one of five people this bus driver let off the bus at the transit center and were told she was out of service. I ask in an innocent voice, “is it because they have to go refuel or something?” 

I hear the dispatch guy let out a very annoyed “UGHHHH!!” then saying to someone in the background, “She knows she’s not supposed to do this, this is the last time!!” Apparently she had been told not to do it quite a few times and this was the final straw. We talk for a few minutes and I tell him I wasn’t trying to get anyone in trouble, but it was kind of shitty, and if I hadn’t had the day off and were trying to get to work, the conversation would’ve been completely different. He assured me this was going to be her last route, which I kind of felt bad about until I stepped off the bus and had to start walking the mile in the rain. 

TL;DR Bus driver kicks people off bus in the rain so she can get off work ten minutes early, so I got her fired. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/72uzp8/make_me_walk_a_mile_in_the_rain_dont_mind_me/,pettyrevenge,136,0.0

The last stop light on my way home from school is a left hand turn that has two lanes turning left.  The right hand lane is intended for people turning into the corner gas station and ends abruptly after the gas station.  As I was waiting in the left hand lane on my motorcycle, a florescent orange BMW (one I recognize from my school parking lot btw) pulls up besides me in the right.

When the light changes we start to pull out and he guns it!  Tires screeching engine revving... right next to me!  He whips around the corner like crazy, and cuts me off inches ^^(ok, ^^it ^^was ^^probably ^^a ^^few ^^feet) and zooms right up-- to the bumper to bumper traffic.  

So here I am, stuck behind this guy that decided to say ""fuck my safety"" because his dick has a napoleon complex, for about 5 miles in bumper to bumper back-road traffic.  It's while I'm behind him that I notice he has the same parking sticker as my apartment complex... lo and behold he pulls into my apartment complex right in front of me.

Now, my apartment has a gate that requires a NFC card to get in, or you can use the keypad to call someone.  Usually, there is enough traffic going through at any one time (especially mid afternoon like this) that if you forget your card you can squeeze over and let someone who has their card through.  Well guess what Mr. Attention Whore does, pulls over to let me up to the gate ahead of him.

So... I swiped my card, the gate opened, and I moved up about 5 feet about an inch past the gate.  He pulls up to my back tire waiting but I just sit there... I turn around and lift my visor and just look at him as realization slowly dawns on his face.  He starts  yelling and honking but I just sit there dead pan.  I waited till the gate was completely closed before I turned back around, flipped him the bird, and rode off to my building.

Fuck you too, prick.

TL;DR-  Asshole cuts me off tires screeching around an intersection, then needs my help getting home.

edit:  Wow front page!  I should clarify (since a lot of people seemed to miss it) that the guy in the shiny orange BMW didn't just ""pass"" me.  He gunned it around me during a turn while burning out his tires in the middle of the street!  I seriously feared for my safety, scared the hell out of me.

2017-09-24 12:48:52+00:00,3390,"Teacher ""Lost"" My Returned Textbook",QueenLorne,"I'm not sure if this is the case for all schools, but where I went to high school, you were responsible for paying for any lost or damaged textbooks. 

About a month before my graduation, I received a notice from the school that I apparently had never turned in a Psychology textbook from the previous semester. Coincidentally (or not), my psychology teacher, Mr. W, was my only instructor from all my years in school that I knew absolutely despised me.

I'll be honest; I kinda deserved him hating me. I had a major case of senioritus and I wasn't trying to hide it. Mr. W taught his class exclusively via lectures and slideshows gathered from the textbook; ergo, reading the textbook on my own schedule at home gave me the same information that I could have learned if I payed attention during his boring as hell monologues. Coupled with my psychology class being held directly after lunch plus a part-time job and extracurriculars, I used Mr. W's class as nap-time. 

I easily passed out during psych 3 times a week, every week, and there were weeks where I slept all 5 days. I even started carrying a big fuzzy jacket to use as a pillow. He fucking hated it. 

I don't exactly blame him, but there was literally no consequence for me. School policy only allowed for a student to be removed from class if they were causing a distraction. I did all my homework and got As and Bs on all my tests, ended the class with an A. I totally understand that he must have been irritated that a student could literally sleep in his class all the time and still receive an A, but I attribute it to his monotonous yet easy class structure. 

 I could never conclusively prove that he maliciously marked my textbook as missing as opposed to sheer incompetence, but I know I turned it in. It was during lunch with some students retaking a test and he was a real tool about it because I interrupted some phone call he was having on his lunch break to give it to him. 

In order to graduate, I had to fork over $70 bucks for an ancient textbook that I absolutely turned in. I was pretty damn pissed, but I thought there was nothing I could really do about it. 

About a week after I sent the money in, I tell this whole saga to one of my friend's mom, a librarian at the local fancy-schmansy private school. When she hears Mr. W's name, she immediately bursts out laughing. 

Turns out Mr. W was in the middle of a pretty nasty divorce. and his soon to be ex wife was a teacher at the fancy-schmansy school and a rather close work-friend of my friend's mom. 

They were getting a divorce because she wanted children, and he didn't, and the kicker; instead of, you know, talking to his wife about it he went a got a secret vasectomy. 

I spent the last 3 weeks of high school spreading that story around the best I could, figuring it was the least I could do considering I had to pay 70 fucking dollars for absolutely nothing. I ended up graduating and feeling like I had at least created somewhat of a hassle for him while I was there. 

I didn't think about this textbook drama for a couple years (I graduated in 2014), but the other day I was talking to kid who is a current freshman at my high school; we were talking about the teachers and when Mr. W was mentioned in passing, she said ""I heard he had a secret vasectomy"". Y'all, a (true) rumor that I started in 2014 is still being passed around. I feel like this is the epitome of petty and I feel quite accomplished.

I have no idea if Mr. W is even aware that this rumor is being discussed, but I like to think he does and is aware that it originated with me. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/724uo0/teacher_lost_my_returned_textbook/,pettyrevenge,168,0.0

Then he signs the paper, leaving the rest of it blank, takes the food, and closes the door.

2017-09-20 23:26:58+00:00,4279,Petty revenge on my law school,scordatura,"I live in Ontario, Canada, and I went to law school many years ago.  So long ago, that it was in the days when the government heavily subsidized post-secondary education.  This little fact is important, as you will see.

I had been able to pay for my undergrad degree by working during the summers.  But law school was a bit more expensive.  My summer earnings did not cover rent, tuition, books and food.  So I applied for and received a student loan from the government.  The funds arrived, and I deposited them to my bank.  The bank, being dicks, placed a long and quite unnecessary hold on the cheque (I later got my revenge on that bank, but that’s another story).  So anyway, I wrote a cheque for my tuition fees for my very first semester at law school. Gave to admin.  Started classes.

The cheque bounced, because of the long and unnecessary hold on my student loan cheque.

That was bad enough.  But the law school wanted to punish me.  And so they charged me a $70 NSF fee.  That was long ago.  In today’s money, that would be about $150.  That’s right: a $150 fee for a bounced cheque.  And if I didn’t pay out, I would be out of the school.  A direct threat to that effect accompanied the letter.

This was the days before email and internet, so I wrote a letter to the admin people, enclosing a cheque for $70, and saying that if they cashed it, then after I graduated and was earning an income as a lawyer, I would never, ever donate a goddamn penny to their university.  

The law school cashed the cheque, of course.  I expected that.  But I actually got a reply to my letter.  In it, a university flunkie explained to me that they got the vast majority of their funding from the government, and so they didn’t go looking for alumni contributions.  They told me in polite and Canadian terms, to go fuck myself.

I was really irritated.  So irritated, in fact, that I ceased any contact with the law school other than what was the bare minimum to complete my degree.  When it was time for us to show up for the graduation photo, I didn’t appear.  And so the group graduation picture for my year, is missing me.  I did show up for my graduation, but I stole the graduation robe they gave me to graduate in.  It’s still in my closet.  But that, of course, was not real revenge.

Decades passed, and then an opportunity for real revenge occurred.

I got a letter from the law school.  I won’t reveal it’s name.  We’ll call it, “Wazgood Law School.”  Any Canadian lawyer will know what I mean.  Anyways, so Wazgood Law School sends me this “dear alumnus” letter, talking about how great it would be if I’d send them money.  I was their alma mater, and I must have happy memories of my time there, and wouldn’t it be great to help the next generation of law students blah fucking blah.  This was in 2003, by which point the government cutbacks in education were really starting to bite.  They’d obviously gone to at least a bit of trouble to track me down and find my address, because believe me, I hadn’t kept in touch.  They’d looked me up, and seen the law firm I was in. 

That night after I got home, I went to my boxes of old law school stuff in the basement.  And amongst my notes from contract class, property 1 and 2, torts, admin law and so on, I found a folder, and in it, the letter from the law school flunky years before telling me that they were cashing my cheque for the NSF fees, and that they didn’t really need alumni donations blah blah blah.  I brought the letter in, photocopied it, and mailed it back to Wazgood Law School, with a short letter setting out how I’d made them an offer (i.e. cash my cheque and I’ll never donate a penny to you ever), that they’d accepted the offer (because they cashed the cheque), and that I was holding them to the bargain we’d reached, assuring them that I would never, ever give them a goddamn nickel so long as I lived, adding that if they contacted me again, I would see to it that they regretted it.

That was the last I heard from Wazgood, at least so far as donations go.  I still get the alumni magazine, but it hits the garbage without me opening it.

As you can imagine, doing laundry was a pain (as was most shopping as well). Come time to do laundry, I went down to the basement and loaded up my clothes. 

I make my best attempts to practice good etiquette, by not hogging machines. Loaded my clothes and started the cycle and returned upstairs (the machine estimated an hour and a half but depending on what the sensors read, it takes up to 15 minutes longer or shorter), so I came back an hour and 15 minutes later to see my clothes on the floor next to the machine-barely wet-which meant someone knew I just started the load and wanted to do theirs for free. I sprinted back upstairs and grabbed my gallon of bleach and tossed in a half cup into this person's laundry and changed the cycle to ""cotton/sturdy"", which really worked the bleach into her clothes and had to mangle her underwired bras.

 I never saw this woman, nor did I know who she was, but I hope she's enjoying all the bleach spots and messed up bras.

She apparently did not learn her lesson the first time, since another time-later, the same thing happened (I could tell because it was the same clothing as previously). On that particular day I didn't have any bleach handy, but I had a pair of scissors. Same situation; my clothes were barely wet, so not only was she stealing my wash time, but also my detergent and fabric softener! So I took a few of her shirts and pants and made several snips here and there (okay, I got a little carried away and took an entire sleeve off of one shirt) and set the machine to ""cotton/sturdy"" yet again. Bitch, have fun looking like Raggedy Ann with bleach spots.

At the time, I was taking a bus regularly to a hospital for chemotherapy, which left me extremely weak and nauseous. So, when possible, I sat in the handicapped section near the front of the bus. Occasionally people would ask me to move. It's a bus to a hospital, so a lot of people need the disabled seats, and I am young and outwardly looked healthy, after my hair had started growing back. Of course, they'd understand when I explained that I needed the seat. 

Enter Bitchy Lady: a smartly dressed woman in her 60s. She asks me for my seat, and I explain that I just had chemotherapy and I need the seat. She calls me lazy, calls me a liar, and tells me that I ""don't look sick"". 

I am too exhausted and nauseous to deal with this bullshit. I've been trying to not throw up for the last half hour. ""Fuck it,"" I decide, and aim.

I puke all over her nice shoes. She screams and jumps back. I wish I'd said something witty right then but I was busy just puking. 

She stood quitely, redfaced, at the other end of the bus, and left me alone after that.

In retrospect, I feel like an asshole for making the bus driver clean up my puke. I was too much of a wreck to help--I could barely stand up--though I did apologize to him. It was a spur of the moment decision and I didn't really think that consequence through. But damn it was satisfying to puke all over that bitch.

edit: Thanks for all the kind words everyone &lt;3 I have been cancer free for 6 months now and getting stronger. I'm going to take this brief moment in the spotlight to plug donating blood. It really helps cancer patients (and all sorts of other patients). I received several blood donations per month and each time it felt like coming back from the dead.

Bit of background, I'm an avid cyclist so I ride a lot and in full gear. I was riding a 40km loop around where I live which is also very popular with other cyclists. 

Anyhow, I was passing through a residential area when I spotted a group of kids kicking a ball around in a yard. I've grown naturally wary of everything around me when I ride so I was keeping them in the back of my mind. Will they run out into the street? Will the ball escape? etc. etc. 

When I was about to pass their house however one of them points me out to his friend/brother, rears up and kicks the ball straight at me. 

It got some air and would have been a direct hit to my side. Instead however I managed to catch it, trapping it between my arm and body. 

They started yelling at me as I turned the corner and continued to ride off...with the ball. 

After about 500m I tossed it into a fenced yard. Oops. 

It had children's toys and was just grass so I didn't damage anything (could see through the fence).

(Think Hallmark, but not that brand name.) As anyone that's worked one can tell you, a good 50% of the customers are clearly enroute to the event they're buying the card for, and a good 50% of those people think that their lack of planning is your problem.

So I'm in the middle of assisting a customer when I see a Very Expensive Car pull up and park in the fire lane outside the store. A man in a Very Expensive Suit gets out of the car and walks in. Upon entering, he heads to the back without breaking stride and shouts ""WEDDING CARDS?"" I don't think he even saw me, he just figured that since he's the most important person in the world, there must be *someone* at his beck and call.

I'm mid-sentence with my customer, so I finish it before addressing him. Before I can, he actually used a little effort to find the clearly-labelled cards himself, which he politely informed me of with a ""GOT IT!""

About 4 seconds later, he arrives at the counter, having obviously picked out the first card he saw. Maintaining volume, he respectfully requests to borrow a pen to fill out the card while he's in the process of reaching over the counter to grab one from my pen cup.

While he's filling it out, as I ring up my next customer around the space he's taking up on my counter, I look down and notice that he's adressed the card to at least one male name. I also notice that he's picked out the one wedding card we sell that is unambiguously for a lesbian couple.

It was going through a couple of changes and as a result, we had a new CEO maybe 3 months after I started. He wasn't a bad bloke, just a little vague. But he did get a couple of his mates in key positions... Including the newly created *Engineering Executive* role.


EE shows up and I dish him out a suite of new toys for him to play with.. Windows laptop, Google phone, etc. EE isn't happy with this at all, he wants Apple. I told him that Apple products are unfortunately not supported, because 1) we don't have budget for them; 2) our apps won't run on them; and 3) the IT team can't support them. So no, you can't have Apple products.


He takes them, but is still clearly unhappy. A week later, and he is bitching for all he's worth about the gear, and starts complaining to his CEO mate. CEO comes to me and asks what the problem is - and I gave him the same response: 1) we don't have budget for them; 2) our apps won't run on them; and 3) the IT team can't support them. Fair enough he says. That seems sensible.


Another week later, EE comes by and chucks his now broken phone at me. He demanded that I make his newly purchased iPhone work. The conversation deteriorated at that point, and CEO got involved. In the end, EE wasn't going to expense the phone to the company, and he had to support himself. But I had to put in place a BYOD policy and allow the phone on our network. And so I did.


12 months pass by, and our relationship hasn't improved. He wins some, I win some, and occasionally we come out even. Other people start using their own phones, and I let them - as long as they follow the BYOD policy and have a device capable of supporting it. People come and go, and the leavers with their own devices stop by on their last couple of days for me to supervise the removal of the company account (and of course I block them in MS Exchange anyway), and tick the box on their leaving form.


And now for unrelated reasons, it's EE's turn to go. I send him an alert - ""hey, make sure you drop by in the next few days so we can go through the procedure"". No response, no visit.


And now it's his last day. I send him an alert again first thing in the morning - ""hey, it's your last day. Make sure to drop by so we can go through the procedure"". No response, no visit.


By lunch time, no response or visit.


By 3pm, no response or visit. I found out that he was having a lunch party with his friends at the local bar and would be a while longer - 4 - 5pm.


I typically finish at 6pm, but today, I decide to have an early mark.. You know, to play with the kids, or whatever other excuse you want to hear. And by early mark, I mean right now. So I mark his exit form as ""failed to attend"", disabled his swipe card access, locked his accounts and reviewed the section on the BYOD policy I wrote about not being able to verify that company data had been removed.... And so I remotely wiped his phone.


I got a message later on that he was absolutely incensed that his phone got wiped - which of course made that Friday beer all the more tasty.

The hard part is that my girlfriend is a very attractive hispanic woman. The owners of this restaurant as I have heard are from Sicily.

When she goes in to order our meatball subs they load up her order. Each sandwich has 5 of these wonderful mixed meats with parmesan cheese. Flirtatious happy Italian men ogling to fulfil her order.

Now if I go in to order the same (white man , blonde hair blue eyes) they are short with me, don't offer options and tell me the x amount. Wanted to charge me extra for parmesan cheese. I literally get 4 meatballs per sandwich. When I get my food each sandwich is short a wonderful spicy meatball.

I went on to ask him several questions about their foods, menu and the pricing. At the end I told him that I had sent both female and male critics to judge their menu. When I explained that our female critic was was being hit upon and offered more than our male critic he went into full out damage control.

I said I would publish my report in the next week. Of course that never happened because I wasn't a food critic.

Intentionally. 

Too close.

So close that there would only be enough room for her to barely squeeze inside her car - but would absolutely prompt anyone to look over and give the wtf/fuck you glare.

When she did, she saw a guy by himself in his car, dick fully exposed, staring at her &amp; going to town on himself.

Instead of giving him any kind of shocked reaction, she ignored him, but did write down his license plate number, and went right back to work unbothered. (this had actually already happened to her once prior, for some reason.)

It was after that that she had a colleague look into the license plate info, for any relevant details, and to their surprise, it was registered to a woman.

My mom then wrote a simple, anonymous letter, and mailed it to the woman at their address - letting her know that while she is out, her husband is using their family car to expose himself to women.

2017-09-11 16:52:33+00:00,4836,You Really Want That Mini Fridge?,sparklehorseys,"I work in an office where we have a small budget set aside for random purchases, it's basically like a petty cash account that we can use for expenses related to our projects and productivity. There are 5 of us who share that account. My team is also on the second floor, where there happens to be a full kitchen (fridge, oven, dishwasher, popcorn machine,  4 coffee makers, etc) RIGHT next door. 

I was given an assignment that involves using a creative mathematical technique. I could build a script for it and spend hours upon hours on it, or I could just get an add-on for the software I currently use and get it done in about 5 minutes. The add-on cost about $200. 

I was talking to one of my co-workers, and told her that I was about to go ask the boss to buy me the software add-on with the petty cash account. No biggie. He'd do it no problem.  Then my coworker started telling me that she was upset people were stealing her coffee creamer from the kitchen, so she was going to ask the boss to buy her a mini fridge for her desk. That  fridge also cost about $200. I didn't think much of it, then left to go to lunch. When I came back, I went to my boss's office and asked him if I could use some of the petty cash funds. He said no because they had just been exhausted, and I would have to wait two weeks. I explained how I needed the add-on to do my job more efficiently, but he told me ""Sorry we don't have any money until the 15th... I'm sure you can figure something out.""  My project was due before then, so I was going to have to make a script. Shit.

It took me hours to build a script to do this because I've never done it before. I had to come in twice overnight, as well. I'm salary, so I don't get paid more for coming in extra hours. Sure enough, a few days later while I was sweating over the script, in walks a delivery man with my co-worker's new mini fridge. I learned through the grapevine that my coworker knew the petty cash funds were low, so purposefully tried to beat me to the punch. 

Okay. You want to play this game. 

I started unplugging her fridge a few months ago. Not every day, but occasionally. I'll unplug it and let it sit for a few days, then sneak back there and plug it back in right before she gets to the office. Every time I do this, everything in that fridge (including her precious creamer) goes bad. She has to clean out the fridge with disinfectant constantly, and sometimes her cubicle smells vaguely of sour milk. The fridge has been exchanged 4 times because ""it's broken."" Every time she asked to exchange the refrige, my boss has to deal with it because he's the one in charge of the account that made the purchase. He's not happy about it. Yesterday, after the cheese and broccoli incident, they removed her mini fridge permanently from the office.

The boss also sent out a memo this morning that says we aren't allowed to make any appliance purchases with the petty cash funds from this point forward, and included a reminder that a full kitchen is right next door. Hmmm... I wonder why he would say that...

Nurse graduated from nursing school and decided with her friend to move to one of the cities that was listed as having ""the most eligible bachelors"" from some publication. She moves and starts dating her future husband. 

Future Husband's mother is a viper and decides Nurse is not good enough for her family.  The  happy couple eventually get engaged and future mother-in-law is having none of it.   Tries for several months to break them up; tries to convince Nurse to go back where she came from and simultaneously tries to gently convince her precious son that Nurse may not be good for him.

To add some more context to this situation, this MIL is pretty nasty to Nurse but hides it well to other people, always making sure she's super (fake) sweet to everyone when others are around. 

Finally wedding plans are set so MIL gets desperate.  She gets Nurse alone with a ""generous"" offer: leave fiance and never come back in exchange for $10,000 (note: this was almost 30 years ago so I guess it was kind of a shitload of money for most). 

Nurse is so sick of this woman's shit and is incredibly insulted. However, she's intelligent and maintains her composure.  Nurse accepts the offer. 

Nurse takes the money, does not leave, and gets married anyway. Nobody else knows about this. 

MIL cannot say or do anything about it without exposing herself to her family as a horrible person. 

Nurse and husband are still happily married; their kids are grown; husband still has no idea this went down. 

MIL has suffered silently for almost 30 years.

For instance I see something as taking an hour and not being so major, but when they ask us in group meetings for his opinion he'll be like ""ermmmm, I think that's being optimistic, it's a real big issue"" etc. I also told him how I found a bug in something coded by a previous developer, he went straight to management and told them I done it and that I hadn't tested it correctly before signing it off 3 years ago, I've been in my job for a year...

But anyway, I'm working on a project now and coded it the way I wanted to - which was exactly to specification. Now, he's higher than me so he ultimately has to sign off the project before I can hand it over. We went through it and he suggested I change things, to which I said it's not in my documentation so I'm going to leave as is. He got real shitty with me over Skype for business and insisted I do this because it ""looks better and feels cleaner"". So I obliged... they took me around 2 days, so the project was late. He didn't mention why it was late so I got a shitty email from my boss for handing a project in over the deadline.

When we get on site to hand it over, they start bringing up things that had been changed saying they weren't happy and didn't sign off or ask for this. He then proceeded to call my manager and tell him all of this saying he needs to have a word with me about it because they're going to be in complaint. My boss calls me in to a meeting and I tell him it was his idea and that's why it was late, point blank the guy says he never and he'd never suggest changes without the go ahead. So I was then on course to get a written warning, I asked him after why he declined and he said he never said anything nor did he mention it. 

Soon as we get back to my office, I printed off the conversations and sent them to HR saying I wasn't happy with how I've been spoken to for doing something my senior told me to do. She's spoken to my manager and they've called a meeting with us to which he says he forgot about the conversation, boss and HR didn't agree and are disciplining him and giving me a few days off for wasted time. 

Tl;dr - guy in work makes me change project work and then denies it when the client complains about changes. Nearly gets me a written warning until I print off the conversations in which he pretty much made me make said changes, now he's getting a written warning and I'm getting some additional paid leave...

At this point I'm about 50 feet or so from my turn, already swinging wide so I can make the turn, and he's about halfway into the intersection. I'm going slow enough that I'm in no danger of hitting him, but I give him a blast from my air horn, and he finishes going through the intersection. I finish making my turn and see him pulled up to the employee parking gate, so I stop behind him after rolling down my window, and ask him if he knows how to read a stop sign, to which he replies, ""No I don't."" Now, I'm not someone who likes arguing over petty stuff, so I just say whatever and proceed to park in line at the truck entrance, and walk up to the intercom, and then after checking in, I tell the person on the other end about the incident, and he says that the company uses a third party company to handle stuff like this and that it will be handled.

Eventually I am assigned a dock door and after I finish backing in, two of the third party employees approach my truck, I tell them about the pickup driver's comment, and they tell me that they know his manager and will be talking to him.

2017-09-05 17:38:36+00:00,9387,You're going to bully a little girl and spit water in her face at the water park? Prepare for the tempest.,SparkyMountain,"So I took my two young sons to the local water park yesterday. They had a blast. I stayed in the lazy river most of the time with them. I tend to stay about 10 to 20 yards behind them. Close enough to keep an eye on them, far enough for them to have fun. 

I'm minding my own business, floating in the lazy river when suddenly a wild bully appears. Cue 10 year oldish husky boy who's following around a much smaller girl. I'm observing over the course of a few laps of the river as this little turd boy is constantly teasing and intimidating this little girl that's like half his size. 

I lap them. I'm now right behind victim and bully, my own sons constantly in my view and I get close enough to hear bully talking trash to his victim, trying to get her to leave the pool.  She's visibly scared and trying to get away from him. There are no accompanying adults with these children. This is when I see the bully take a mouthful of water and flat out spit in the girl's face.

At this point I'm like YOU DID NOT and I go into action. Things are crazy and hectic because we're surrounded by people in a loud water park so I know I can get away with this. 

Just loud enough for him to hear me, I say to the bully from behind him, ""Hey!"" Bully turd turns around I proceed to go full E. Honda palm splashing right in his face. After about 6 seconds of spashin blastoise level water in his face, bully is coughing and girl is 10 yards ahead near my sons. My work here is done. 

I proceed to say nothing and pretend nothing has happened. Bully stands shocked, catching his breath in the lazy river as the hapless watergoing masses float past, oblivious. Ten minutes later bully is gone and victim has returned to merriment. 

I think the life guards saw me and just didn't care. 

TLDR: Grown ass man sees boy kid bully spitting water in a little girls face. Grown ass man spashes bully in the face until bully is coughing.

10/10 Would recommend.

A few years ago, she was at a busy grocery store. She had about a third of a cart... Lady (I'll call her AW for Awesome Woman) in front of her had a full cart.

Note, this was a normal lane, not an express one.

Some idiotic woman (IW for short) cut in front of AW.

AW- What do you think you are doing?!

IW- I only have a few things. I'm in a rush.

AW- I don't care. There's a line.

AW - Sweety, you have less than  me. Why don't you go ahead of me?

Mom- Oh, Um... I don't...

AW- Oh no honey, you're fine. - giggles- I would have let her go ahead if she would have just asked instead of cutting in like an entitled bitch.

So, today my mother and I were grabbing some wood stain from a particular home improvement store that quite likes the color orange. We're looking for a parking space when a Entitled Bitch (EB) pushes a cart out of a parking space and into the main road that you drive up to find a parking space, almost hitting our car (mom had to brake pretty hard) and almost rolling into another. Mom told me to go grab it and put it in the basket return spot (about one row down). Now, this wouldn't be a petty revenge story if I did simply that.

I proceeded to grab the cart and, while staring directly into EB's eyes, push it in front of her truck and leave it there, blocking her in (How horrible!). Of course, she starts honking, yelling and cursing like an Entitled Bitch. 

EB: ""Why can't you go put it up?""

Me: ""Why can't YOU go put it up?""

We walked in, grabbed our stain, and while we walked back out to our car, I saw EB's truck parked with EB nowhere in sight. So what do I do?

I take 7 carts, put 1 in front of each door, and 3 in front of her truck. Maybe she can put them up this time.

P.S. as we were pulling out, I noticed there was a basket return TWO SPACES TO HER LEFT. Jesus.

2017-09-01 15:02:30+00:00,4527,Dirtbag College Kids,Jewfros,"Growing up my parents lived in a Townhouse. We lived on the end of a set of 5. The middle house was a good friend who also happened to be a cop. 

The house next to us was a renter, normally the renters were college kids, not too noisy or rude, just did their thing so it wasn't a bad deal. Well one year we get these 4-5 kids staying in a 2 bedroom house, and all of them had a car. 

So whenever we got snow, my dad and I would go out and shovel out 2 spots for our family's cars, and 1 spot for the cop neighbor for his police cruiser as he worked nights and didn't want him to have to shovel when he got back home at ~5 in the morning. So we finished shoveling and not 10 minutes later, all 3 spots we shoveled are parked in by College Neighbors. My dad and I, rightfully pissed off, go knock on the door to tell them to move and of course they don't answer. So of course we spent the next 3 hours shoveling every bit of snow from the yard, the road, the driveways, every flake we could find, right onto their cars. The only thing you could see at the end was mounds of snow. No evidence of a car whatsoever. The next morning when I woke up I peaked outside to find all 4 college neighbors trying to dig out their buried cars with just their hands, as they were trying to leave for class. After that they bought shovels and didn't take a spot they didn't shovel. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6xf2zu/dirtbag_college_kids/,pettyrevenge,263,0.0
2017-08-31 22:10:54+00:00,2083,Garbage-ass neighbor again,biliogna,"My jerkwad neighbor who loves parking in my driveway parked there again this winter. He apparently didn't learn. We had several snow storms this winter and there were advisories to not park your car in the street, for plowing purposes. Of course shit nugget still doesn't want to pay $270 for a parking pass, where he lives. My parents were visiting, so all of our cars were in my driveway. We were having dinner, and here it is in the middle of the fucking night he doesn't call-first, nor does he ring on the door bell. He bangs on the door [not knock, there's a difference] interrupting dinner with my family. I ask what his problem is

 ""I can't park on the street, let me park in your driveway.""

 Ex-fucking-cuse me?? No ""May I?"" let alone a ""please?"" I, politely said ""No, you can't"" and especially since my driveway was full and it's MY FUCKING DRIVEWAY, I'm not going to move my parents' cars nor mine just for him to park. He left and went to demand parking in other neighbors' driveways. They too-know he's a piece of shit and are long fed up with him as well, so they said no. 

He comes back later after hearing him swear up and down the block. He knocks again and I tell him that he can park if he gave me $60 bucks; I wager that's the price if he wants to take my time out from having dinner with my family to move all the cars out of my driveway and have him at the end of the driveway [so he wouldn't be blocking us in]. He starts cursing and walks away. I didn't care; finished dinner with my family. 

The next day came about and it's when the advisory is in effect. My parents took my dad's car and they went to get groceries, only to come back and find that asshole parked in the driveway, AGAIN! Okay. Now you wanna play? I tried calling a truck, but they were in a delay what with getting people out of their cars and the tow-truck companies are fully booked during the winter, so I wasn't going to wait hours. I didn't ring his doorbell or anything because I knew his response [he pretends to not be home when it's times to alert him of his shitdickness]. 

Having some warm cider in my living room, I see him leave with a friend and they go out, but he rides with his friend and leaves his car in my driveway. Lightbulbs turned on. My driveway is mostly flat, thankfully, so my dad and I jacked the rear end if his car and pivoted it out of the way, and there was barely enough to wiggle my dad's car back into the driveway. But we got it out of the way enough that we could get cars in and out of the driveway with careful maneuvering. Now he's still gone, and so I took the jack back under his car, and jacked the car up right on its catalytic converter. Its bent and has left a slight opening in the exhaust-work. 

Also left a scratch at the bases of his door, have fun with rust, in some time. It's pretty freaking cold out and I had brought in my garden hose for the winter, but I hooked it up to my basement sink and set it on mist and thoroughly showered his car with water, giving it a decent coating of ice over the door handles, on the windshield, and windows. 

The snow gets heavy and we haven't noticed him return yet [we figure he would return because he'd have to be flumoxed about his car being covered in ice]. We got an idea, though. The snow stopped a bit and we began some shoveling and packed mounds of snow around his car, thus making it inaccessible. 

He returns and asks what happened to his car. I ask him why he parked where people shovel snow into piles. He knew damn well he parked there, but it was fun watching him take an entire day trying to melt the ice and free his car. He said he was going to call the cops, and so I told him to, he didn't since he probably knew he would get fined and I can charge him with trespassing. Dumbass also thought it was a good idea to try and melt ice with hot water; cracked his windshield. Have fun with rust and an exhaust leak. Try it again. Play stupid ass games, win fucking stupid-ass prizes.

Some of my roomies had guests over one weekend when I was out of town and when I got back on Sunday night, I noticed that my razor had hair stubble in it. I didn't think much about it, but it was one of those expensive refill razors, and later on one of the guests ""asked"" me if it was okay if they had used my razor. I was kinda miffed about what this lazy asshole had done, so I told him I was okay with it, but that he should probably get checked for Hepatitis B, since I was infected since age twelve (**I wasn't**) when I had a bad blood transfusion in Vietnam when my family was on vacation.


The entire group hearing this dropped silent and the offending asshole turned white. I told him ""sorry man, I didn't expect you to use my razor, otherwise, I would have given you a new blade or disinfected it for you. You better get a blood test."" The guy asked me if I was serious, and I said ""as serious as a heart attack and two kidney failures"".
A few hours later, my roomie asked if it was true and I said ""yes"". I am guessing his friend must have shit his pants. I let the lie go for about a week and then I fessed up, evil fuck that I am.

2017-08-23 23:43:22+00:00,6850,Office-mate who loves CNN but doesn't understand how televisions work is destroyed by that which she loves most,ashushu,"Hi! Long time lurker, first time poster. I told this story to my friend and she suggested I post it here, so here it is for your judgement/enjoyment!

I work in a small office with only 6 people. The way the office is broken up I share my office with another person, so we're essentially facing each other. It's away from the other offices, so we're kind of left to our own devices. I've been working here for about three years now, and have always gotten along with my office-mate. My old office-mate left to start a family, so I've been alone for a bit before they hired Marge. 

Marge is what you'd find if you googled ""worst office-mate."" She brings in smelly food she eats at her desk, she plays loud music in our shared space (even after being asked not to), she fights with the boss on every little thing, she's nosy (always asking me where I've been when I walk back into the office, and I've literally caught her listening in at the bosses door). She asks me invasive questions, and when I finally snapped at her to mind her own business she acted like I'd personally assaulted her. 

She *HATES* Trump, which, I mean, everyone in this office does, but she feels the need to CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT HIM. She is CONSTANTLY relating headlines and giving her commentary, it's like we have CNN on at the office. I honestly wouldn't find this so irksome if she didn't call him a racist in one breath, and in the next lament that there ""are not enough white doctors"" in America. Whatever. I only bring this up because of what happens next. 

Since she loves to be outraged by Trump she needs to watch CNN as much as possible. And again, I just want to point out that we're ALL outraged by Trump, we just don't talk about him constantly - and gleefully. It seems like she enjoys hating him. While WE are all sick about the racist shit happening across the country, it seems like SHE is enjoying the unrest, like she loves to be outraged. It seems inauthentic to me, and for whatever reason her attitude offends me.

Anyway, she *needs* to watch CNN. So, on her break she heads to the office break room which is shared by everyone in the building (like 300 companies). The TV is set by default to CNN but sometimes someone will change it. I noticed that, since she is electronic illiterate, she cannot figure out how to change the channels on the flat screen TV (she asked me for help but I told her I didn't know how lol). I noticed that she got really upset one day when the TV wasn't turned to CNN, and complained to the front desk reception (lol wut?) who dutifully sent the maintenance man up to *change the damn channel.*

Seriously. 

So, since I am a petty person, I downloaded an app that can work as a universal remote. I synced it to the break room TV and, since I take my lunch before her, I'd switch it away from CNN from the comfort of my chair. No one is in the break room while I'm on lunch, so it's not disruptive. 

Every day I'd take my lunch, relax in the break room, and watch the nature channel. Every day Marge would demand that the maintenance man go up and switch the channel for her. I don't know if they offered to ""teach"" her to change the channel, or if she's just too stupid to figure it out from watching, or what, but every day she is upset, and every day she comes back from lunch complaining that ""this whole office is against me.""

Heh. 

This went on for a while. BUT, one fateful day I was heading to the bathroom when I heard a commotion coming from the first floor lobby. I wander over and look over the railing to see Marge squaring off with the girls at reception, yelling at the top of her lungs. 

""I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE. CNN SHOULD BE ON AT ALL TIMES! THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!!!""

(Side note: she totally has the ""I want to speak to your manager"" haircut)

The poor girl at reception says something back, I can't really hear since she spoke at a normal volume, but I think it was along the lines of ""our maintenance person is busy"" because Marge continues with:

""THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! HE CAN'T GO UP FOR *ONE SECOND* TO TURN IT TO CNN?!?! THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. YOU PEOPLE ARE INCOMPETENT AND RUDE!!""

She was yelling all sorts of things, some of which I can't even remember. The gist of it was that Marge felt the staff of the office building was personally attacking her by not switching it to CNN on demand. 

I get an idea and sprint back towards our office. I vault over a desk, skid around a corner, fling open our door, and compose myself before calmly walking by the bosses office, stopping in his doorway and tilting my head. 

""Do you hear that?"" I ask, innocently. 

""What?"" He asks, looking up from his work. 

""That yelling - do you hear that?"" 

The boss gets up with a curious look on his face and I shrug and walk away. He walks out of the office and out onto the landing, just in time to witness Marge call a tearful receptionist an ""incompetent idiot."" and ""a stupid Mexican"" (I know, she's a racist pig, that's part of why I've been messing with her). 

Boss watches quietly for a minute before going back into his office. I sit down at my desk and get back to work. Soon, Marge storms in, still angry. She's grumbling and visibly upset. 

Boss calls her into his office. Meanwhile, the clock strikes 6 and I pack up to leave. I can hear muffled yelling coming from bosses office but it's time to leave so I grab my stuff and head out. 

The next morning I head to work and notice something is different right away. I walk into my office and see that everything that belonged to Marge has been cleared away. 

She'd been fired. My boss bought the receptionist a bouquet of flowers to apologize and fired Marge. I'm told that she didn't do much work anyway and they probably won't replace her. 

Now I not only am rid of the most hateful bitch I've ever know, but I have my office all to myself now. 

I'm pretty pleased with myself, honestly. And my boss. 

**Edit: Maybe I shouldn't have added the bit about Trump, but I thought it was important to show her hypocrisy as one of the reasons she's deserving of petty justice. I didn't mean for the comment section to focus on the politics of it or devolve into name-calling, though I probably should have guessed it.**

**Look, bottom line: There are shitty people who are democrats, and shitty people who are republicans. There are also great people who are democrats, and great people who are republicans. Marge was a shitty person who happened to be a democrat - this says nothing about anything other than that *she* is an awful, hypocritical person. If you're using this to justify hating on democrats, or republicans, blindly, then you're likely just as bad as Marge herself.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6vmzyd/officemate_who_loves_cnn_but_doesnt_understand/,pettyrevenge,564,0.0
2017-08-23 11:44:35+00:00,2415,The Revenge Nudge,betrayalatitsfinest,"Background: My supervisor has been a bitch to me for no reason for several months. I don't know why, and neither do my coworkers, who generally like me. She criticises my work even though it is average, never gives me credit for my ideas but instead waits and then pretends it was her idea, and other bullshit. I usually don't care but after s few months of this she got under my skin.  Note for later, I pass her house on the way to work, she lives alone in a condo. 

Revenge: it was yesterday, I was heading home for the day. Tired, bored, moseying towards my car. I hear the familiar brisk click-click of her shoes behind me. She passes me on the sidewalk, even slightly shoving me. Instead of apologising, she gives some remark along the lines that I walk even slower than I think. 

I stopped dead in my tracks, dumbfounded by her rudenes while she walked on. Her phone rang, so she clawed it out of her purse and started talking loudly and laughing. She went on towards her car. That's when I saw them. Her hasty phone answering had swept her keys out of her purse. House, office, car all in one bunch. There on the curb. 

I acted on my lust for vengeance. I took three small steps. Neck suddenly sweating, heart pounding, split second decision. I did it. With my foot I gave the keys the little Nudge of Revenge that they needed... to slide off the curb and down a storm drain. As I pulled out of our lot with my blood rushing in my ears she was still on her phone, her purse rummaging getting more flustered. 

I've been at the office a few hours. Her car was still in the lot when I got here this morning. She came in late with murder in her eyes. She doesn't seem to suspect me. I'm thrilled and super nervous at the same time. 

UPDATE: this is what I've overheard so far. As for new keys, a friend of hers across town had a spare for her condo, and she had a spare for the car at home,  so minor hassle. But it is her last spare for the car, risky... and dealerships around here charge $100-200 depending on make and year for an extra key. Heh! 

Now, the office key is a horse of a different color. Rumor around the coffee pot is that she might be on the hook for replacing every lock for the exterior doors. Property manager is going to talk to the insurance company today. If they say this violates the liability, oh man... certified locksmiths, heavy-duty security locks, new keys for entire staff... looks like your vacation will be in-state this year, bitch!

This woman was a patronizing, condescending, and miserable piece of shit with whom I detested from the start - she was the type who woke up with the intention of fucking over as many people as possible and cried herself a river when she didn't get her way - you know the type.

She blamed me for anything and everything from office equipment malfunctioning, to a smudge on the window, to her beautifully organized colored ink pens being out of order, to stealing her parking spot (I was working there WAY before her, and had it reserved until she had parking change the numbers.), etc, etc, etc.    Real fuckin' bitch.

I was fortunate enough to know of a law office with an opening and was immediately offered a position, as I knew the managing partner.  Gave in me two weeks, and was happy as a clown.

On my last day there, I snuck in to her office at lunch and microwaved the whole damn Atlantic Ocean in her own private microwave - salmon, tilapia, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies in one big mixing bowl.  Not a large amount as I don't like to waste food, but just enough to create an essence of a fish market. The smell was soon overwhelming and I felt like a Goddess.  I then closed her door, walked out of the office, and ended my last day of work at 1 PM.

When she first started, I heard her telling our receptionist that she HATED fish and that even the faintest smell made her throw up.

Fuck you, Christina.

2017-08-21 14:46:31+00:00,3721,Next time you won't spoil a TV show for me...,mutemutecitybitch,"Years ago, when Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead were still in their infancy, I worked at a small delivery company as a driver. I was generally only in the office for a few minutes a day, as I was out in my truck making deliveries. There was this disgusting receptionist working there. When I say disgusting, I mean that she was both a disgusting human being and looked like the bulbous guy from 300 that wanted to join the army. She was racist, homophobic, rude, and just generally a mean person. Since she sat at the front of the office, she decided that yelling conversations across the room was the best way to communicate with anyone more than 3 feet away from her.



So one morning after The Walking Dead had aired, I walked into the office and headed straight for her. I knew she'd be spouting out spoilers about the show, so I thought I'd let her know that I hadn't seen it and asked if she could wait 2 minutes until I left for the day until she had any spoiler heavy conversations about it. I wasn't the biggest fan of the show by any means and, like most people I know, stopped watching it after a few season. But early on in the show's run, I was still pretty into it. 



I approached her and asked if she was ok waiting to ""converse"" about the show, but she just stared at me. A dirty, bent smile spread across her wrinkly face, her meth head teeth dancing in the fluorescent light like broken little rocks on the sea shore. 



""I guess you should have watched it last night.""



She then turned to one of our coworkers and asked how they felt about a character dying in the episode last night, continuing to spout out any spoiler she could possibly muster. She looked back to make sure I was still standing there listening. I froze in anger, wondering how any could be such an ass and plotting my revenge. I stood by her desk, staring at her as the folds in her Hutt-like face flab about like the wings of an overweight bird. 



I thought about how much she loved Game of Thrones. It was her favorite. She talked about it all the time. I asked her once if she had read the books, and she laughed at me like I was an idiot for having read a book. At this point, Game of Thrones was still following the plot of the book for the most part and I decided that this was how my revenge would be unfolded. After making sure everyone else was out of earshot, I tapped her shoulder and stared her dead in her lazy eye. 



I then dropped every Game of Thrones spoiler I could possibly imagine, surely ruining the next couple seasons for this woman that hated spoilers more than anything. She finally stopped smiling, a blank, unintelligent look on her face. She forced a smile and said, ""That's ok, I don't care."" I could see the pain behind her eyes. She cared. She's yelled at someone once when they spoiled a minor Game of Thrones plot point. She cared. 



I shrugged my shoulders and turned to leave, but before I did, I looked back and said, ""I guess you should have read the books.""



The resident bog monster of my office never spoiled a television show for me ever again. 


Edit: Apparently it's important that I point out that most people didn't stop watching The Walking Dead after the first few seasons, as the numbers rose over time. However, most people I knew and, arguably, a lot of hardcore fans that were disappointed by the direction the show took stopped watching.

2017-08-18 13:28:22+00:00,2995,Accidental but...potent...revenge on a cock-blocker 'BFF'. [Long but worth],Mister_Valentine,"This happened 3 years ago. 

I used to be a big time MMO nerd. I picked up playing a little known MMO called ArcheAge, with which I fell absolutely in love. Open world, go wherever, do whatever, level however you'd like. Form groups, commit 'acts of piracy' and crime, it had something for everyone.

After a year of playing I had made a name for myself on my servers active community as the notorious bad guy pirate, which of course drew positive attention from players of the same 'MURDER EVERYONE' style, leading to the creation of a large group of merry pirate fuckboys and fangirls. 

After a couple months of recruitment I crossed paths with a gorgeous British-Chinese girl who lived very close! We'll call her Christy. 

After talking and getting pretty deep in to it for a while we ended up meeting. We got together with a couple of other Britain based members of our group of toxic nincompoops and went to Comicon in Manchester.

She brought her best friend along. David. 

David did not like me. Not one bit. It was obvious at the time that he wanted to be more than friends with Christy, probably for a long time. As we roamed around, sat to eat, drank a couple of pints and would get closer and closer throughout the day, he'd be sure to pop in between us and try to slow it all down.

Without success. After our day she invited me back to her place to stay for a weekend to hang out and game together. David, being her very best of male friends, was also invited.

Throughout my stay this gentleman would do anything he could to deny my safe and steady passage to the Gates of The Orient. 

Late at night, she invited me to her room to watch netflix on her Laptop in bed while David and Christy's (pretty chill) roommate were watching Anime and playing videogames. Fifteen minutes in to Tokyo Ghoul S1E1 this guy comes walking in asking what we're doing, without knocking. He sees we're watching tv fully clothed and slinks away.

An hour later he comes in, we're less clothed, but still just watching Anime and talking, but significantly closer. He asks if we need a shower because he's about to use it.

Twenty minutes later, he comes in again to tell us he's done in the shower. Without knocking. This time, we were not just watching anime. He did not enjoy this sight at all and stormed off down stairs and out of the front door. Christy says 'for gods sake' and we get back to it. 

Wake up later that AM. Christy is crying. I'm thinking I must have been an awful lay, but she shows me that David called and sent texts multiple times between 4am and 10am fundamentally declaring that he is no longer her best friend, with classics like ""How could you do this to me?"",""You barely know him"",""he's an absolute cunt"". Note that I was never rude or even remotely impolite to this guy throughout the duration of my knowing him. Even paid for his drinks and food!

Sensing some real bullshit I don't need to be getting involved with, I tell her I'll catch the train home and we can talk tomorrow after she's dealt with the drama on her end. 

We shower together, fool around a little, and I head out the door. Before I'm out the door she kisses me, and goes down on me stood in the closed doorway. I finish, she swallows, hooray - my first blowjob.

As I leave I notice David on the corner heading back to Christys place. I yelled after him asking if he's okay and wants to talk about it, his exact response was ""I don't have words for you. I'd rather speak with fists"". David was about 6'4 but weighed less than my baby sister. I said 'alright' and off I trot to my train.

Later that day I give Christy a call and ask what happened after I left, if she was alright, what's the situation etc. 

She told me David barged in to her front door seconds after I passed him in the street, grabbed her and kissed her hard, wet and deep, professing his unending love. Christy had barely left the hallway yet. Christy didn't get a chance to brush her teeth, get a drink of water. David essentially sucked my leftovers from her mouth after threatening me in the street. She didn't tell him.

**I did.**

edit: end credits in comments

edit2: People say they can't see my comment on their phone so here:

As is the nature of all good things, it came to a swift end.

Christy turned him down, stating they've been friends too long and there's no attraction on her side.

I found David on facebook and shot him a quick message asking how I taste, and gave him my number in case he wanted seconds, shortly after Christy told me about the exceptionally dramatic smooch (I was a brutal asshole)

He blocked me immediately. She told me that despite our obvious chemistry and similar interests there's way too much going on her end.

For the sake of her friendship she cut things off with me. I can respect that, bros before hoes etc. Now, she's engaged to be wed to a much older gentleman I assume her very strict parents introduced her to. No chance for her and myself to become anything more. David and her don't talk anymore, last I saw was a screencap from her roommate of David going on a niceguy rant on facebook.

Shame really, I did like her a lot. Can't help but feel like the stars aligned to deny us a relationship. No regrets though, one hell of a way to pop a few cherries!

I was just walking back from the cafeteria to my desk. There's a courtyard that connects the cafeteria building to the building I spend 8 hours in as cal center slave. Between the cafe a day my cubicle are a total of 6 doors. 

I was exiting the cafeteria with my burger and drink when I found myself behind a slightly heavy set lady with nothing in her hands. She turns slightly as she sees me walking behind her and continues to exit to the courtyard. 

There are two doors leading to the courtyard and she pushes through both not even trying to hold them for the person 2 steps behind her. It's okay, I'm an adult, even if prone to childish displays of pettiness, and I can open my own doors. 

As would befit her heavy set stature she was slower than me. So I walk around ​her and open the next two doors with just enough room for me to walk through. And I continue to my desk without a backwards glance.

This is my overly petty revenge story that I still can’t believe happened as it’s so stupid. This is early 2000’s when World of Warcraft you could only lvl to 60. (Before tokens, this is important)
 
My longtime live in boyfriend and I have ended it when he put me in the hospital, no second chances; we were done, I was out. When dividing up the stuff he didn’t want anything as he was moving into his sleaze ball of a friend and I was moving into my own apartment so I needed almost everything. This is why I think this whole thing is stupid, I wanted the furniture he wanted my WOW lvl 60 Druid healer that was used in most of the guilds raids.
 
Yes, I am a girl and in the early 2000’s I was a total geek chick that loved WOW and was the best healer in the guild. But he wanted my account, I wanted to move on with my life. Whatever here is my password.
 
6 months later my life is great, new circle of friends, new boyfriend, and new WOW account on new server.
One night I go to watch one of my DVD’s and its empty.
Now, how often do you actually watch one of the DVD’s that you own? Well for me, I end up watching my favorite movies on TV with commercial breaks rather then walk 3 feet to put the DVD in, but I degress… I look in another DVD case its empty.. I used to have a friend that worked at Blockbuster so I owned over 350 DVD’s and over half of them were empty!?!?
 
In my get the F out of there quick move.. I never noticed the DVD cases were light.. All my action movies, my stupid movies, the CHICK FLICKS!! Were empty! I was pissed!
 
I called the X and told him I wanted my DVD’s back, he laughed and hung up on me.
 
After being pissed for a couple of days, it popped in my head that my X wasn’t the brightest bulb in the box.. I wonder if he changed the password on the WOW account..
 
He didn’t
 
He was into football, so I knew that was the only time he 100% wouldn’t be in the account for a while. Was during a game, so I logged in and looked at my beautiful Druid and went to Town.
 
I spent all of the gold. ALL OF IT. Then I permanently destroyed everything I could. What I couldn’t, I sold and mailed the Gold to another toon on the account and deleted it. The only thing I left was the little white kitten which was a gift he gave me when I started playing the game.
 
During this time I opened a service request with Blizzard letting them know I was the owner of the account and I was quitting the game. So that I wouldn’t be tempted to play anymore I am deleting all of my legendary equipment so it would be too hard to start over.
 
I also mailed the guild leader to let them know what X did and they kicked all of the toons out of the guild.
 
Right before I logged out I looked at my poor druid in her underwear..
 
I got a call from him when the football game was over like clockwork.. I laughed and hung up

---  

Edit: Thank you for the gold fellow gamer. 

My X took a lot from me, stole a good chunk of my life only leaving me with a scar and a stupid story that fellow gamers truly understand. 

A lot of comments asked why I didn't change the password and take the account back, well the toon was on his server with his jerk friends and his guild. I couldn't play on that server anymore without running into that guild they would have made my gaming life hell. 

Second most popular question: Asking for the DVDs back after I changed the password  I.e. Blackmail oh his cop buddies would have loved that. No thank you. 

Third: What exact items did I have on my Raid Healing Druid from 13 years ago that I lvl'd from Beta to 60, back when you walked to lvl 40 to get a slow ass mount, and when 5 gold might as well been a million. A pink tutu for all I care at this point. I can only tell you what I remember. 

I would think the most important question is what was the white kittens name: Midnight ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6tuezv/steal_from_me_i_will_delete_you/,pettyrevenge,236,
2017-08-11 11:54:11+00:00,5197,I started a huge fight between my ex-wife and her boyfriend.,SpartanDoubleZero,"So some back story as any good revenge story requires.

I deployed in mid 2014, returned the first week of 2015, a super short easy deoloyment. I came home to an empty home, actually, someone else was living there. Check my email after finally getting cell signal turned back on, and see an email from south west with a plane ticket. I catch a ride to the airport, and fly back to my home town. I finally get home almost 13 hours later dying to see my daughter. 

That night is when I found out my ex had been cheating on my for the 6 of the 7 months i was gone.

So I asked her, what do you want to do, do you want to work through this or stay here, and she couldn't make up her mind which meant it's gonna happen again and I left back for my duty station.

So I looked into how to make those glitter cards and just dump glitter everywhere.

I sat down and started making them, about 50 or so. And I printed out my Ex wife's address and had to do some digging to get her boy friends address. So I printed the addresses on stickers so it couldn't be identified by hand writing. And began mailing, 1 every day for the next 25 days to each, with each Other being the return address. 

When I would Skype my daughter I would be hearing my ex bitch to her mom about the glitter. And how it's really pissing her off that ""boy friend"" is doing this.

2017-08-08 17:36:24+00:00,2065,Poop return,TheBellaBubbles,"I sometimes pet sit to help out friend's of my parents or friends of our family, it also helps me earn a little bit of extra money, but generally I don't do it for the money because I like dogs. 

My dad's sig other's friend was going on a yoga retreat for 7 days and needed someone to take care of her cat at her house and have her dog taken care of at mine. She said to just come and take care of her cat every other day by cleaning out his litter box, giving food, and water. I told her that would be fine as long as I got $20 a day which is very cheap for pet care. Usually I charge 30 a day for each animal but since my dad's sig other has helped me alot in my life I was doing it as a favor to her. 

When I get the dog I notice the dog is infested with fleas and is covered in bites. I don't text her anything cause I feel bad for the dog and now my service dog is also infested with fleas. So I buy flea medicine and wash the dogs. Her dog Max still isn't cured of the fleas so I have to clean the entire house every day with flea medicine and wake up covered in flea bites. 

I still didn't say anything to the owner because this is the best friend of the woman who helped me when my own mother didn't want me. 

The cat I visited and took care of filling up it's bowls with food and water every other day like she instructed. I even made sure that the dog's bowls that were there had water too. 

The cat was a giant cat, the biggest I had ever seen and took dog poop sized shits in the litter box enough to fill a grocery bag every time i visited. 

Also I watered her plants like she wanted me to every time I came over except for yesterday because it was raining. I can over every other morning before work at 7 am because I work from 8 am-9pm almost every day. So since the owner told me she would be back today this morning I wasn't going to take care of the cat today. 

When the owner gets back she is angry and tells me she will not be paying me 11 dollars for the cat or at all because the litter box had poop in it and there was cat throw up on the rug. I tell her to check her outside trash because there is a trash bag full of poop in it from the cat box. She sends a photo of her cat poop in a bag that's in a grocery bag.


 I tell her that she owes me 20 a day for the service. That her dog was infested with fleas and infested my house and my dog, and that she will reimburse me for the flea medicine as well, and pay me for watering the plants. I tell her to check her trash cans outside because there is a trash bag full of poop out there. 

She replies she doesn't need my attitude and lip, that I am a young child who needs a better business etiquette. And that it's been raining so she won't be paying me for the plants, and there is throw up on the floor so she won't be paying for the cat, and that she isn't going to pay for the dog because he has fleas. 

The young child remark was funny because I'm 2 years older than her 18 year old boyfriend, and she's a 45 year old lady. 

I tell her to take the money she ""would"" have paid me and get her dog professional help and that I'm sorry her yoga retreat didn't teach her how to respect people. And that if she had paid a kennel to house both her pets for a week it would have been close to $500 and that I was only doing this as a favor. And that calling me a young child is not going to make her right. 


 I tell her to get her dog out of my house and never talk to me again. I tell her again to check her garbage cans and I hope she finds another college student to take advantage of. 

She tells me to bring her dog over when she isn't home so she doesn't have to look at my face. 


So while I am at her house I take the white trash bag out of her garbage can that is filled with poop and dump it back into the litter box. It's over flowing and is falling onto the carpet and onto her clothes that she left all around the house. I also make sure that when I return her dog's things I chuck them onto the floor. 

I know I may have acted rash, I am usually a calm person but after being bitten by fleas for a week and getting paid nothing I think that this was justified. I hope she enjoys her poop return. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6sf35s/poop_return/,pettyrevenge,107,
2017-08-07 18:51:02+00:00,3780,Make me live in unlivable conditions? Let's see how that works out for you.,Caliblair,"I have been living in my current apartment for about 11 months and a week. My roommate and I were prepared to renew our lease but in this last month the quality of our apartment has fallen off a cliff.

There are several three foot holes cut in the walls of the hallway dripping water filled with black, white and green mold that have been open with no additional repairs for almost a week. Then our hot water went out and after three days of submitting service requests online and calling the front office I finally threatened legal action. Then when the repair guys finally came (at 5pm on a Friday after I had been calling it in since Wednesday morning) the repairman kept bitching and moaning how I was ruining his weekend. And for the week proceeding and following my water heater repair my pipes have intermittently been pumping up brown and yellow water.

I went to my leasing office to complain and tell them about the issues. I brought photos and videos of all the issues and told her about the repair staffs rudeness. Her responses were ""My repair guys wouldn't say that, you're making it up."" , ""It's just mold it's not going to kill you and we don't have to tell you anything about repairs not inside your apartment so why don't you just mind your buisness?"" and ""Yeah, repairs take time, you couldn't be patient."" and my favorite, ""It's just rust, you'll be fine.""

She then had the GALL to tell me if we were renewing our rent would be going up. I canceled my lease right then and there. But here is where my true revenge begins. 

After signing a new lease at a new apartment building I wrote a six paragraph, scathing account of the incidents including, photo and video. These then went on Yelp, Google, Rent, ApartmentGuide, ApartmentList and every other realty website I could find. I sent copies to their corporate headquarters, the Fair Housing Agency, the Code Enforcement Agency and a lawyer. I've already been told that what I went through constitutes 'inhospitable living conditions' and that I am not obligated to pay rent while living on these terms.

If they'd just done the repairs, apologized for the delay and left my rent alone they would have had us for another whole year. 

Now (thanks to AdWords) every time you google my apartment complex, the first result is my scathing review and pages of photos of brown water, rotting wood and mold.

TL:DR : My shitty apartment bitched about repairs and now I've wrecked their reputation, am taking them to court and having them investigated by multiple government agencies.

This just happened yesterday. Recently, my brother passed away due to leukemia. We just had his funeral and it was a great to officially say good bye to him. We both bonded over a lot of things, video games, music, etc. I'm very protective of him, so when someone fucks with him, they'll get it.

So after the funeral, I heard my best cousin make a cancer joke about my brother.  I was enraged, but stood off to see if he said anything else. Of course, that dick decides to play the Misha cancer song. That's the part where I felt my blood boil. Worse timing, especially when all my relatives were there, so I decided to set up a plan.

He's one of my favorite cousins (not anymore lmao), and I lent him a bunch of stuff such as a gamecube, couple Xbox accessories, and a bunch more during the times when we used to hang out. We were going back to his house for a family dinner later, so I decided to get everything back when we were about to leave.

So we're about to leave, relatives say goodbye to each other, blah blah blah. During this time, i storm upstairs with a bunch of grocery bags and start packing everything up. 6 full bags of all my gaming accessories that I've missed so much. As I'm walking down stairs with the bags, he goes up to me and says ""what fuck are you doing with my shit?"" I proceed to say ""***Your*** shit? You mean **my shit**, you fucker. Don't make cancer jokes about my brother and think you'll get away with it."" I stick up the middle finger and get in my car, happy as fuck. As I sat in my driver's seat, I heard him screaming to his parents about me taking ""his"" stuff. Screw his parents, I didn't even care anymore.

Right.

Junkie McRatface goes back to her conversation, telling her mate about the court case she's just beaten; ""No conviction recorded, no fines, and I can get my learners licence straight away."" Describing how she totally conned the magistrate, and then goes on to name the magistrate and what court she was in. Apparently her defacto was pissed she didn't get jail time, for some reason. Also the cops didn't find all her lozerapam(?)

Cool story, good to know.

2017-08-02 02:21:08+00:00,4757,Verbally abuse me and my mom? You no longer have headphones.,Pammyhead,"My mom’s dickbag of an ex-husband used to treat me like gold until I became disabled from an accident and had to move home permanently. He had me completely suckered that he was a good guy until suddenly I was the scapegoat and he finally let me see his awfulness. Still, for a few months I tried. I followed all his stupid rules. I never expected it to be like it was before, I was just hoping that maybe things wouldn’t be quite as awful.

I’m also the most IT-minded in the house, so when Dickbag ordered some wireless headphones I set them up. It took some figuring out since we had a bit of a hodgepodge system of old and new tech. Getting them to work included using an A/V switch box I had but wasn’t using, so he could easily flip from the headphones to the stereo.

Then came The Fight. Dickbag came home one night while I was watching TV. He said he wanted to watch a video, so I either had to turn it off or hit record. At this point I was sick of his shit, so I said no, the show had fifteen minutes left, he could wait. He started screaming at me, calling me, and I quote, “not human,” and, “a fat slob who’s nothing but a parasite.” This from the man who mooched off my mother for 18 months while he was unemployed, not even looking for a job. My mom stood up for me during this fight, and after more yelling it ended with him finally sitting down in front of the TV and ignoring Mom and me.

So I took my petty revenge. Those nice wireless headphones? The ones I was letting him borrow some of my equipment to use? Nuh-uh. I grabbed the A/V switch box, unplugged absolutely everything from it, and didn’t even attempt to hook anything back up. If he wanted to use those headphones so badly he could figure it out his own damn self. He yelled at me to hook it back up, but I just said, “This is mine,” and took the box to my room.

He never did get them set up again. He moved out two-ish years later (the divorce was long and frustrating), but the headphones are still here. I win, Dickbag.

(Side note, this was the fight that really opened Mom’s eyes and convinced her he didn’t just “have a temper,” he was abusive and he needed professional help or to get gone. I have never seen her yell like she did that night standing up for me.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6r15t7/verbally_abuse_me_and_my_mom_you_no_longer_have/,pettyrevenge,197,

He would make me watch golf all the time.  One day there was a tournament something like the US Open.  He sat me down in front of the TV and said to watch golf and maybe I would learn something.  So I ended up watching the full coverage of the round that day it was about 4 hours of boring golf.  

The next day he invites me to watch some more golf with him.  I push back but he forces me to watch anyways.  Well this was a recording of the previous days tournament coverage.  I told him I have already seen this and make my way to the door.  He gets angry with me and tells me to sit down, watch golf, and shut up.  I was so mad and plotted my revenge.  I had $5 in my pocket and started betting on events that would happen.  Oh that guy is 200 yard away from the pin hitting from the rough, ""I bet he will hit it 4 feet away form the hole"".  I figured if he is going to make me watch the same programming twice I would make him pay.  I ended up with $50 which was not too bad for a punk kid.


Edit:  TL;DR - Grandpa made me watch a live golf.  He forgot he had made me watch the same event when he went to play it off of the VCR and lost many bets.

I would like to address some comments ITT.  First I was a kid around 9-10 so watching golf was not interesting to me.  Second, grandpa was an asshole that treated my grandma like a servant.  When she got sick he attempted to pull the plug on her.

Back in 1994 I bought a 1989 Ford Escort as a work beater to drive the 25 miles each way back and forth to work. It was in good shape and got great mileage (40 MPG) because it was a 4 spd manual. I try to take care of my vehicles but I not overly anal about them, but when somebody dings it up because they're careless it chaps my ass.

One day before work (I worked 2nd shift) I went to Best Buy to pick up the then brand new Korn CD. I bought the CD and went out to my car to open it and give it a listen. As I was unwrapping it a lady in a brand new Ford Taurus with paper plates pulled into the parking spot on my right. She flings open her door and bangs the edge of her door into the middle of my passenger door. It didn't hit real hard, but it was enough that I knew it had to have left at least a small dent or paint chip. I looked up at her expecting her to apologize, instead she just gave me a shitty look, closed her door and walked away. That instantly pissed me off.

I decided if she wanted to act like an entitled bitch I was going to teach her a lesson. I waited until she was about 75 ft away, then leaned over and unlatched my passenger door. I twisted my body in the seat, lifted my right leg over the shifter, then proceeded to kick my passenger door open as hard as I could into her door. It hit so hard it left a crease in her door. No amount of touch-up paint was going to fix it.

It was so loud she turned around to see what happened, immediately realized I'd bashed my door into hers and came marching her fat ass back towards her car swearing up a storm at me. I just started up my car and drove forward out of my parking space before she got closer than 10 feet to my car. I gave her a fake smile, a quick wave and a couple beeps of the horn as I drove away while she stood there fuming and cussing up a storm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6qi29z/ding_my_door_give_me_a_shtty_look_and_dont/,pettyrevenge,257,
2017-07-27 15:47:49+00:00,13631,I absolutely LOVE people who pay with pennies!,neontonsil,"Seriously. 4 years ago, I'm cashiering at a whacky mart on a register that holds all the smokes and alcohol. It's 10pm and these two young men (early 20s) come up to the counter. They have three random novelty items (I don't remember they were), but it was strange and unusual to get odd items this late at night. Maybe it was for some fraternity, I don't know. It's a college town so I get weird stuff from frats a lot. I scan the items and tell them their total is $22.xx.

Grinning at each other, they reach into their jackets and slam down two gallon zip-lock bags, full of only pennies. I stare them in the eye, but they didn't even look back at me. Everyone else in line groan and went to other registers. These two kids knew what they were doing, but they didn't know what they were in for because I prepared for this; I knew this was going to inevitably happen. I grinned with them, because I was gonna get paid during this. These pranksters are here for recreation. This convo occurs between Me, Ringleader (the other guy was silent and awkward), and a friendly coworker of mine.

&gt;Me: Is this $22.xx?

&gt;Ringleader: ...

&gt;Me: Did you count it?

&gt;Ringleader: Nope.

&gt;Me: Are you going to? 

&gt;Ringleader: Nope.

&gt;Me: Is it at least $22.xx?

&gt;Ringleader: Don't know.

&gt;Me: Nice.

&gt;Coworker: Hey! You guys can use the self checkout. It can take all of your coins at once.

&gt;Me: Oh, don't worry about it Cowor--

&gt;Ringleader: Nope, don't trust them lady.  (Partner laughs)

&gt;Coworker: What? Why!?

&gt;Ringleader: Doesn't count all your change right.

&gt;Coworker: I've used them before. It really works!

&gt;Me: (to Coworker) I got this.

I unpacked the ziplocks and threw all the pennies on the counter. It was a beautiful, massive shitstorm of a mess. And I digged in it. I was Frank in a dumpster in 'It's Always Sunny'. The two, still averting my gaze, start chuckling as if they were taking away my dignity. They whisper to each other ""Dude oh my God,"" ""Dude yeah,"" ""Dude, hilarious.""  I counted each penny, one by one. My coworker comes up to me.

&gt;Coworker: Guess I'll help you count this.

&gt;Me: Don't worry about it.

&gt;(She looks at me confused. Then she puts on her 'get down to busy' look.)

&gt;Coworker: I got your back.

&gt;Me: *Oh...*ok.


We worked up a system where we counted ten, put them in a pile, then with ten stacks of ten pennies we separated them, making $1 piles. We made progress slowly but surely. Some customers came to the line, but we advised them to get to another line. Some of them looked at us confused, but when they saw the counter full of pennies they understood. Some decided to wait, but when they realized it wasn't going to take just a few minutes they took their leave. Another register in the liquor department opened so it wasn't too bad for other customers. We get to about $12 (about 10min in) until I ""knocked"" over the piles.

&gt;Coworker: Neontonsil!

&gt;Me: Oops. Sorry.

&gt;(Coworker looks at my grin. I give her a wink and tilt my head, motioning her to leave)

&gt;Coworker: You know what, I think I better let you do this.

&gt;Me: Ha, alright.

&gt;(Coworker leaves. I look at the two guys. They are absolutely stunned at the fallen piles of pennies.)

&gt;Me: (To Ringleader) Yeah, I'm going to have to count all of this again.

&gt;Ringleader: ....Ok.

I started from zero. I count slower then ever, and made my way back up. The duo is entirely silent. I get to about $7, when suddenly I say:

&gt;Me: Drats. I lost count. I better start all over again.

&gt;Ringleader: Really? 

&gt;Me: Oh yeah man. 

&gt;Ringleader: Why!?

&gt;Me: I lost count, sir. I could be in trouble if my register doesn't have the right amount of cash, and I don't want to rip you off. 

&gt;Ringleader: ...

It's about an hour later. My manager walks past, looks at me. I smile at him, and he looks at the counter. He walks away without a word. I eventually count all the change and surprisingly they had only $18! 

&gt;Me: Hmm, I think that this is $18.

&gt;(The duo has been dead silent. They look done for the night.)

&gt;Me: I'll recount it.

I fucking recounted it.

&gt;Me: I think this is actually $19.xx.

&gt;(Without a word, the Ringleader whips out a $5)

&gt;Me: Seriously? You had cash?

&gt;Ringleader: Needed to get rid of my change.

&gt;Me. No problem. I'll just recount this again. I want to make perfectly sure that this is $19, since I counted $18 the first time.

&gt;Ringleader: Are you kidding me?

&gt;(I shake my head no, completely serious)

He takes out a $20 bill straight out of his pocket and throws it at me. My coworker gives the biggest WHAT THE FUCK face. Internally, I die as well, because they were smart enough to have a backup plan. And the fact that he was touching his cash in his pocket the entire time kinda messed with me. I take the cash, do the transaction, give him his change, thanked him and wished him a good night. The two start to put their pennies back in the ziplock bags and I didn't help them at all. I watched them just as how they watched me. Lots of pennies dropped to the floor, but they didn't care to pick them up. It looked like their souls were sucked out of them. It was past midnight and I clocked out way past when I was supposed to. A lot of my coworkers gave me a thumbs up or told me good night. Even my manager told me 'good job,' the only two words he ever said to me. Went to bed at the dorms after such a great petty penny night and crashed. Strange to say, but I'd love to count pennies again.


**TL;DR** I recounted 1900 pennies like 5 times. Was it 5 times? I better count again.

2017-07-26 16:32:56+00:00,5718,"""It's a free lake, isn't it?""",WebberWoods,"This happened a couple years ago at my parents' cottage. This cottage community used to be pretty sparsely populated and felt pretty remote...back in the 60s when my Dad was a kid. These days it's completely built up and feels more like a subdivision with water between the houses instead of roads. A sunny summer Saturday can get really busy. My Dad, however, still likes to go up there for a quiet relaxing experience---something that is still only kind of possible because their place is on a tiny little island to itself. Lots of boats go by out in the open water, but they don't come in close so it's not much of a bother.

Then one day my parents, myself, and one of their friends are sitting on the dock, enjoying a quiet drink as afternoon turns to evening, when they see two fishermen in a pontoon boat pull around the point of the island, trolling along the waterline. This happens sometimes, and isn't a big deal so long as people are respectful. These two were not.

As they get closer and closer to the dock, it becomes clear that they just don't give a crap. They end up trolling right by the dock. And I mean RIGHT by it. Like 5 or 6 feet. They are just laughing, drinking, and smoking, completely oblivious to our stunned silence right beside them.

After the initial shock wore off, my Dad stands up and says, ""A little close, aren't ya fellas?""

Tweedledee just sneers at him, gives him the finger, and yells, ""It's a free lake, isn't it?""

By this point, they are already trolling past, getting further away from the dock. My Dad was pretty annoyed, but that could have been the end of it---that is, until Tweedledum decided that he would throw his empty beer bottle into the lake.

Now my Dad likes his privacy, but he *loves* the natural beauty of the Canadian North. 

One time when we were young and stupid, my brother, myself, and a bunch of our friends were pretty drunk and decided it would be smart to throw our empties at a nearby rock outcropping to see if we could hit it. Surprise, we could! And we had some really idiotic drunken fun until my Dad came down and unleashed a fury upon us the likes of which I had never seen. Long story short, we spent the next week or so picking shards of broken glass out of those rocks by hand. 

When Tweedledum threw the bottle in the lake, my Dad became committed to his petty revenge. Without a word, he walked over to our big steel boat ([not exactly like this, but close...quite the beast by this lake's standards](https://media.boatbuys.com/artwork/006FF07C-6BB4-2922-1F10-8E5A2C2DBD7C.jpg)), untied it, and hopped in. I jumped in at the last minute just to make sure he didn't get his ass kicked or something. 

But, to my surprise, he didn't go over there to give them a piece of his mind. He just adjusted the speed and trim of his boat to make the biggest waves possible and started driving circles around the tweedledouches. [Pontoon boats](http://www.tahoepontoons.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/electric.jpg) are pretty nifty, but they aren't exactly seafaring vessels designed for big waves. They got absolutely swamped, not to mention the fright it must have given any nearby fish. 

They were yelling and cursing at us, waving their arms for us to slow down. After a few more circles my Dad slowed down enough to hear them.

""What the fuck, man?! Fuck off!""

My Dad just smiled at them. ""Hey, it's a free lake, isn't it?""

They just grumbled, flipped us off again, and took off. We followed them for a bit, but once they were a kilometre or so from our island we peeled off and went home to enjoy the rest of our evening in peace. 



Edit: Please, let me clarify a few things. 

To the people saying that there is nothing wrong with fishing close to a dock---fair, but there's gotta be some respect and common courtesy there. Our dock is a small L-shape and they were inside the L. I could have hopped onto their boat with ease. Just go around, especially when the owners are there using it. Most people who troll by will clear both ends of the docks by at least ten feet, we maybe exchange a nod/wave and we get on with our lives. These guys were just so unconcerned with our presence that it caught us off guard. My Dad then probably escalated the situation with how he spoke to them about it.

To those concerned about the safety of the circling maneuver---I should've specified that he was decently far away. They got their feet wet, maybe ruined a pack of cigarettes or something, but there was never any danger to either boat or any of the people in them. Was it illegal? I dunno, probably. Is my Dad an asshole? Generally no, but he certainly can be. I never claimed that he was 100% in the right. After all, aren't we here for a bit of pettiness?

2017-07-23 15:44:34+00:00,2379,"Cut off my girlfriend, eh? Good luck with your shopping.",Phisopholer,"This happened at Costco a few months ago. As most of you know, each Costco is equipped with a high tech security system that prevents low-born plebeians from entering their premises and sampling their fine wares. I had dropped my girlfriend off at the front door and parked the car. She grabbed a cart and was standing off to the side of the entrance while waiting for me to navigate the clusterfuck parking lot, and when she saw me approaching the door, started to push the cart inside. She was presenting her Costco Identification to the door attendant when a group of three non-English speaking Asian women pushed their cart quickly around her, and stopped dead in her path while one began fishing their own Costco ID from deep in the depths of her own purse. My girlfriend simply turned around to look at me with her jaw dropped, and waited the 20 or so seconds while this woman presented her own ID, chatting away cluelessly all the while. Knowing what needed to be done, I grabbed a cart from the stack and followed my girlfriend inside. I told her she would need to do the shopping as I had more important matters to attend to. I spent the next 20 minutes following those women through the store and cluelessly and obnoxiously blocking their path at every turn. I would push my cart around them only to stop dead and in the aisle and listlessly stare at some item on the shelf while pushing my cart back and forth across the aisle with one hand. I would push my cart towards them while they walked down an aisle, only to cut directly in front of their path and fake a phone call, while they grumpily pushed my empty cart out of their way. When one of them decided to try out the cushions on an L shaped couch, I parked my cart preventing her exit from the couch, effectively creating a triangle of annoyance. To add to it, I pulled out my phone and with the sound on began playing an urgent game of Angry Birds Star Wars 2. My girlfriend was able to fill her own cart full of bulk toiletries before these women had even managed to make it halfway through the store. She whistled at me to show me she was on the way to the registers, so I pushed up ahead of them one last time, dropped my still empty cart dead in their path, and abandoned it to join my lady at the money collectors. The last I saw they were still stuck behind it, and probably are still to this day. 

Edit- I have had a couple people ask why I included the fact that they are non-english speaking asians. I did this for two reasons. First, there is a well know stereotype that people who come from a few different asian countries have little to no sense of regard for others when navigating a public space, and especially so when it is crowded. If a person perfectly perpetuates a common stereotype, I see no issue in identifying them as such. It helps give the reader a better mental picture because they are able to relate to their own personal experiences that may have been somewhat similar. I am not going to withhold that information simply to avoid being viewed as a bigot. You may consider me in any manner you see fit, as is your right. I only consider myself a realist. Second, the fact that they did not speak English was mentioned because it partially determined my actions. Had they been a group of black, white, brown, blue, purple, or green English speaking women, I would have made a sarcastic comment directly to them, probably somewhere along the lines of ""I am so sorry ladies, I didn't realize you had priority today. Please forgive her (my girlfriend) cluelessness."" If you disagree with my choice to include their race, there should be an arrow pointing downward somewhere for you to click.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6p1yro/cut_off_my_girlfriend_eh_good_luck_with_your/,pettyrevenge,196,

One particular girl flashed her student card and kept walking. I guess she didn't realize that she needed a second card from the school to take the bus for free. After she passed, the driver said ""you need the other card"". She didn't hear him and kept walking, so he started yelling sarcastically after her.     

BD: ""Oh you're just going to keep walking and ignore me.""  
She didn't hear him, the bus was pretty packed.    

He kept going, saying various rude things about her.  
BD: ""I get it the rules don't apply to you, you get things for free.""  
Girl: turns around ""Oh sorry I didn't realize you were talking to me, I thought I only needed this card""  
BD: ""well that's not how it works, if you don't have change you need to get off the bus""  
Girl: ""okay, how much is it?""  
BD: ""That would be obvious if you looked at the signs""  
There was no need for him to be so rude and the girl was clearly flustered and embarrassed. She paid, apologized, and sat down.   
The driver kept muttering to himself and bitching about other drivers.      

So when it was my stop, I walked to the front of the bus, made eye contact with the driver and then... 
I exited without thanking him.

Poor choice of words. It is owned by a family though). It's not my favorite job I've ever had because the customers are incredibly entitled. However, it's a fairly young business and I've been in customer service long enough to not give in to spoiled customers just because they want me to. 

Anyway. The end of the night was approaching, beautiful, sacred closing time. We had gotten a decent rush about 20 minutes before we closed (at 10pm) so we were a little cranky about how behind we were on finishing our tasks for the night. At 9:55, we're finally getting somewhere with our cleaning when the phone rings. Sounds like a youngish boy, I'd say 15y/o at most. He asked what time we closed, and I responded with my usual, ""We close at 10 every night, but we'll be open at 11 again tomorrow morning!"" That's not working for him. ""My friends and I really want some of your drinks but we can't be there by 10, can we come like five minutes after and still get drinks?"" I tell him no, the doors get locked promptly at 10. ""Oh, well we really want the drinks, what can you do?"" I say ""You can be here by 10, because I personally will be locking the doors."" We hang up. I know he's going to try to come in anyway.

Sure enough, at 10:06, my coworkers and I hear a bunch of banging and rattling on the closed doors. Yep, like three or four high school aged kids. Sorry, we're closed. The chairs are up, the menu is turned off, someone is mopping, THE DOORS ARE LOCKED. Any time they catch one of our eyes (which we all do our best to avoid) they give us what they think are puppy dog eyes, and we laugh and shake our heads at them. No dice. They keep assaulting the doors. It's getting annoying, so I look up at them brightly with a big smile and start walking toward the doors. They start getting excited, thinking they've finally worn us down. I hold eye contact until I swerve to the right to turn off all the lights. I could hear their collective ""awwwww!!!"" of disappointment through the door. It felt amazing. They left. I laughed. I won.

When checking people out, there were two things you're supposed to do. 1: read the titles of the movies and give the due dates. 2: tell people to have a nice day/night after handing them their movies on the other side of the security gate. 

So a guy comes in with his two kids on a busy Friday night. He has a few children's titles and a soft core porn flick. I ring up the videos and tell him the due dates of the kid movies and say ""the other one is due _____"" trying to save him a little embarrassment. I walk over to the security gate to hand him the videos where I'm planning on telling him to have a good night, but he's still at the register.

One guy, a wrestler had this annoying spoiled brat sorority girlfriend who we can call Marty. Marty was a stuck up self righteous bitch. She would get drunk and then start fights and eventually make us all listen to loud make up sex. And she smoked our pot. A lot of it. Like she lived there and was paying for it, but I guess she figured since she was giving up the booty to one guy  she got free pot from the house. Not so. 
I had a room off the main living room where the tv was and my dresser was right by the door. We would load the bong but leave it on the dresser ready to go but out of sight of the main room. My old bong was a graphics with the black plastic ring that went around the mouth piece. The day before our formal we set a trap. 
I left the bong loaded but wiped a big smear of black ink all around the mouthpiece. You couldn't see it against the black plastic. We started partying and waited. Sure enough my bong hit is missing and the alarm goes up ""who stole my last bong hit??"" Right before we were about to leave! Everyone denied taking it including Marty-- who had a huge black circle around her mouth. We kept on saying ""you wouldn't lie to us now?"", and ""you're SURE you don't know anything?"" And she kept lying her ass off. 
Then we lined up for the group picture before the formal. All in tuxes and evening gowns.

His owner left him on the side of the road in my neighbourhood for two days without food, water or any help. I took him to the vet, paid for his meds painkillers etc... But I can't afford his surgery so after looking for help pretty much anywhere I could, I started a gofundme. His owner refuses to pay for the bill and I fell in love and want to keep this adorable sweet cat that deserved none of the bad things that happened to him so it was logical to ask for help on the internet, I'd do anything to save this kitty.

Anyway, I joined a few GFM groups on facebook to promote my GFM page. I had people donating, sharing, really nice caring people giving me advice and then I had assholes.

It's a small victory!

I've had dick pics before, I never sent them to anyone, I just ignored them, whatever I wasn't gonna search through their facebook friends for their mom or dad! But this is an exception, this guy was being quite nasty simply because I rejected his dick pic. Again, it's quite sad that some people take advantage and think they have some kind of power over you just because you're seeking for help and it puts you in some sort of vulnerable position. I get it, having a GFM isn't well seen by some or puts you in some kind of inferior position but really, I'm just trying to save a poor little cat and this cat IS GORGEOUS so P*** Go fuck yourself.

2017-07-16 03:31:15+00:00,2952,Bully gets rejected,SFAR95,"So there's this girl in my class (let's call her Anna) who's been bullying me since the beginning of the 1st year. Coincidentally, she's also the class' hoe and makes a point of hitting on every male may they be single or not.
I'm a 2nd year university student and I live with my boyfriend and his friends who are all in 3rd year. Both our classes are really small so we share the same studio and I tend to sit close to the 3rd years. One of my flatmates (let's call him Jay) is the course's ""pretty boy"" and nearly every girl has a crush on him.

Anyway, so I'm doing my work in the pc row in front of Jay when Anna passes by me and pushes my chair as per usual to go talk to him. So they start talking and she uses her overly high pitch voice tone and laughs at all he says even if there was no comedic intent in his words, whilst bending over to show her cleveage. Anna being Anna, also makes a point of doing all this whilst staring at me as a form of intimidation (I assume).
Once she realizes Jay isn't at all interested in her, she makes her way back to her computer, once she's right behind me, Jay calls me quite loudly and goes: ""you still coming over this evening?"" and smiles. .
I had no clue what he was on about so he invited me to go to some party. She looks at him and then at me in utter fury and goes away in a tantrum

Later that day he told me he made all that up because he saw how she was treating me and wanted to embarrass her.
Ever since, she hasn't harassed neither of us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6nk6cy/bully_gets_rejected/,pettyrevenge,153,
2017-07-14 17:28:26+00:00,2119,Petty Revenge on New Neighbor,halfchewedcaramel,"This happened to my girlfriend and I last June (2016) when we moved into our new house (basement apartment).

The move went flawlessly as we didn't have much furniture to haul and our friends helped us out. Since it took no time to move into our new place, we decided to grab some beer and order pizza for all of us. Keep in mind, this is on the same day of the move and we didn't get the chance to greet our new neighbors as they were not home all day.

We live in my girlfriends cousins basement and he didn't mind that his driveway was full of my friends vehicles. Some needed to park on the road because the driveway was full. Cars were parked in front of our house, so people who showed up late parked randomly on the street. All in all it was a great night and we kept it pretty civil making minimal noise for surround residents.

The next day was a different story though, as my girlfriend came running in the house crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said the neighbor to the right of us approached her and scolded her (she said she was an inch away yelling in her face) about people parking in front of her house. Apparently she did not want people parking in front of her house because it is her property (I can smell the bullshit from here)? I felt horrible, as my girlfriend is not the aggressive type and would run away instead of retaliating. I gave her a hug and told her that everything would be okay...I was going to take care of this.

Instead of firing shots back at my miserable neighbor, I decided to have my friends over again for the next 3 nights. Instructions were clear, even if my driveway was empty I want you to park in front of my neighbors house. Seeing as my friends and I smoke, we go outside and see my neighbor peering out her window staring at us and the vehicles parked in front of her house. I told my friends to keep eye contact, smile, and wave at her while she was looking out the window. We did this every night, and as soon as she saw us she closed the blinds. After this occurrence, my neighbor never bothered us again about parking in front of her house (which we rarely do now).

I never got a chance to go over to my neighbors house to say Hello, but I think I made my point. I understand that we cannot park in your driveway/front lawn, but the road is city property and anyone can park there. Suck it.

2017-07-13 13:44:26+00:00,2083,Steal my coursework? I'll steal your sports deal.,mangorra,"I knew this guy at university, lets call him Sam. Now we used to be good friends, he wasn't the type of person you wanted to study with per se but he was a good person to party with. Unfortunately, his academic laziness caught up with him and he needed to ace some assignments to graduate with a half decent degree. This resulted in him going behind my back and submitting my 13 page assignment as his own, I informed the professors and academic committee who needed to look into the matter but it could take a few weeks.

Unfortunately for me, Sam was acting like an arrogant twat. He kept laughing my face and saying I deserved it for not helping him, and that when he graduated he would be playing football for a top club. We are in the UK at the most competitive sports university in Europe, so some of our most talented students get picked up by premier league sides for their academies. 

According to Sam, a number of big name scouts were coming to an exhibition match to watch the lads in action so of course everyone was very hyped. The match was between ourselves and a long time rival in a nearby city, coincidentally my boyfriend Rami studies there and plays for their football team. Now Rami knows of the situation between Sam and I and is very unhappy, but being the level-headed dork he is, he tells me it's best to wait for the academic committee to come to a decision on Sam.

This would've been a sad end to the story, had Rami not encountered Sam trashtalking me at a local bar. Now Rami is one of those people who is either at 0 or a 100 when it comes to revenge, 99% of the time staying at 0 since he believes revenge to be somewhat meaningless. At this moment however, he was a 110.

Cue the day of the match, scouts are sitting pitchside with notepads and eager to watch stars like Sam impress them. Firstly, before I continue with the story I need to tell you their positions which they play so you understand what happens. Rami plays Left Back, so he plays at the very back as a defender on the left side. Sam plays as Right Wing, so he plays alongside the striker on the right side. This means when the teams clash, Rami and Sam would be continuously going head to head.

Now, in football legal tackles can often take multiple forms, usually they are precise and agile and target the ball specifically. Or, you can go the more aggressive route and smash through the player, the tackle is legal assuming you hit the ball first. Now unfortunately for Sam, Rami was not in a friendly and precise mood. Within 4 minutes of the game, Sam is making a run down the wing and Rami is waiting to greet him. Rami flies in, gets the ball away but positions his tackle so he smashes into Sam, making him somersault into the air. Timeout is called, people check on Sam to make sure he continues playing which of course he does, don't want to disappoint those scouts now do we. So Rami goes in with hard tackle after hard tackle, at the end of the first half Sam can barely stand, his legs are bruised and wrecked from the assault. Breaking Sam's legs isn't what Rami wanted, he wanted Sam to force himself to keep playing in front of the scouts whilst trying to hide the pain from his injuries which Rami achieved. Needless to say Sam didn't get called up by the scouts, and during the time his legs took time to properly heal he was replaced in the first team by a newer player.

As the icing on the cake, the academic committee suspended Sam from the university, forcing him to retake his final year with every grade capped at 40% which is the bare minimum passing grade. All because of his douchebaggery, Sam lost his near guaranteed sports deal and a university degree. I'm sorry if this story isn't up to standard or is too harsh, but I just wanted to talk about this somewhere.

2017-07-12 14:43:50+00:00,14699,Shitty server demands a better tip,cookiemonster1997,"A couple months back, my boyfriend and I went out for drinks one night at this cool little ""speakeasy"" in Montreal. It's actually quite an interesting place. You come in through a nondescript entrance and the place has a really nice vibe going on once you get inside. Note: this is one of those bars where the server comes to your table and serves the drinks rather than one where you order at the bar and take the drinks back yourself.

We were seated at our table by the server. We ordered a couple cocktails. And then a couple more, and then a couple more after that. Each time we had to order, my boyfriend or I would have to go fetch the server so he would take our order or go up to the bar, order, and then bring the drinks back ourselves.

Then, when it came time for the bill, I went up again so he would come to our table. He came and thought we were going to order again despite me clearly asking for the bill when I went up. So, he went back to get the card machine and it was another ten minutes before he was back. At this point, I was quite ticked off at the not-so-great service and was debating whether or not I should tip him. The screen had an option for 10%, 15%, 20% or ""other."" I decided to just leave 10% as I wanted to avoid an argument with the server. Montreal service employees are pretty damn notorious when it comes to the expectation of tips.

Now, he prints out the receipt and takes a look at it and sees I left 10%. He then asks if we had a nice evening, to which my boyfriend responded that we did; we both thought it was just a standard question servers ask so we didn't bother telling him about the poor service received–especially because it wouldn't really make a difference at this point. The guy then says, ""oh, well if you had such a nice time, than you should've left at least a 15% tip. Because, in Canada, it's customary to leave a minimum 15% when the service is good."" I'm guessing the reason he felt the need to outline that's how it is in Canada is because I'm a brown guy.

Now comes the petty part. I responded, ""oh I didn't know, why don't you cancel this bill and redo it so I can tip you properly. He said sure thing, just give me a second because the manager has to approve bill cancellations. Again, we waited a good 10 minutes for him to come back with the new bill. I was happy to wait, though, because once he came back, I put in the PIN and then selected the ""other"" option for tip and left him 0%. He printed out the receipt and his look of disbelief was well worth it. We got up and my (white Canadian) boyfriend said, ""Our only tip for you is to give better service and not be so much of an asshole. In Canada, we don't really like assholes.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6mud8s/shitty_server_demands_a_better_tip/,pettyrevenge,1564,

2017-06-26 12:25:18+00:00,2482,Insult my mother? Have fun cleaning your window every day,bicky005,"Happened about 5 years ago, still gets me fuming. LTL, FTP.

So I live in a pretty quiet neighborhood. My mom often takes a bike ride with our dog on a leash, because she loves running and has enormous amounts of energy. We know this isn't particularly legal, but it's a small dog and she listens very well (she's a mix between jack russel and fox terrier). Here's a pic http://imgur.com/wAg70y2

So everyday, people watch my mom passing by with the happiest dog ever. In comes the local street bitch. She's a fat POS who's driving a big SUV and parks like an asshole in our street. Never says hello to other people and doesn't show up on the annual street BBQ (kind of a tradition here). She has a shitzu and a yorkshire terrier who bark at every person crossing their window. No education at all. One day, she was outside cleaning her windows (she does this every week) with her dogs on the porch, no leash on.

So my mom is riding past her, greeting her like she does to everybody, when suddenly her two dogs come bursting out and attack our dog. Our dog gets scared, wants to escape by moving around the bike, the leash gets stuck between the front wheel, flipping my mother over the handlebars, smacking on the pavement. Meanwhile, the dogs keep attacking and barking like a murder has been committed. 
Mom is crying, she's in tremendous pain and has trouble getting up. Every sane person would have stepped in and helped a person in need, but not this bitch. She just stands there, laughs at her while she's on the ground and says: ""That's what you get from biking with your dog on a leash."" And continues cleaning her windows. Mom drags herself back home, gets upstairs and cries like I've never seen her cry before. I get home, go upstairs to hear what the fuss is about and she tells me the story.

Something snaps in me, never have I seen my mother like this. I run outside, straight to that cow who is still outside, like she expected me, and start to cuss her out for every bad word in the dictionary. She yells back at me that I'm attacking her and she's calling the cops on me. Cussing goes on back and forth, but I realize it's not going to help anything. So I head back home. We can't call the police, because my mom did something ""illegal"", so we don't have a case.

From that day, mom never went biking again, so I took the dog on long walks and letting her run in the fields. Every time we passed the bitches house, I collected the biggest hog from my throat and released a big, nasty, snotty wad on her precious window. This went on for three years, until we moved out to a different city. I hope she knew it was me.

TL;DR: local bitch's dogs cause my mother to fall off her bike. She laughs at her, I spat on her precious window for three years.


EDIT: A lot of people wonder why it's illegal to ride a bike with a dog on a leash. In Belgium it is written in the law for safety standards. Also, not showing for the street BBQ doesn't make her a bitch, the remarks she made at my mother did. Her dogs were without leash on her 'porch' (just a little pavement between her house and the street, not like USA) so she was at fault too. But hey, I can't prove that. This was 5 years ago, I'm over it now. My mom didn't injure herself badly, just a lot of scratches and pain in her shoulder. She cried mostly because of the reaction from that lady. My mom is very kind hearted, has always helped other people and is very sensitive. She can't understand how someone could react in that way. We never did anything bad to her.

EDIT 2: I've looked into it, it's only illegal when you're being pulled by the animal or holding a leash with one hand, Nothing is mentioned about a bike attachment ( I believed it's called a 'springer' here)",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6jkr6b/insult_my_mother_have_fun_cleaning_your_window/,pettyrevenge,214,
2017-06-25 08:49:01+00:00,2303,"Guys dog bit my daughter, then was a lying jerk. So we got his dog impounded and, sent him the bills for it.",notvonweinertonne,"This happened about a year ago. 

My step daughter was at my moms house. While she was there, she asked to pet the neighbors dog. They allowed her too, and the dog snapped at her and bit her in the hand. 

While the bite was not that bad. It did break the skin. So we thought getting the shot record for the dog and taking her to the doctor would be the best course of action. 

With this this is where the neighbor turned into a douche bag. My mother went over to try to get the shot records for the dog. The guy promptly started to yell and curse at my mother. Leaving her to call me in tears. (I was on my way over, but 30 minutes away) 

Shortly after that my step daughters dad arrived. He then went over to try to get the shot record.  Guy changed his tone when a 6'4""  guy showed up at the door. Still wasn't pleasant but not yelling and cursing. Guy told her dad that the dog was up to date on its shots. And was trying to find the papers. Shortly after this I arrived. So my step daughter and her dad went to the local hospital to get her hand treated and checked up. 

So I continued the hunt for the shot recorded. So after much pestering from me. They finally gave me a vets name. So I could get the paper work I needed.  

I call the poor vet in the evening and tell them the guys name and his dogs name and see if they have any record of the dog. And if its shots were up to date. 

Guess what? They did have records of the dog, but the dog was only seen as a puppy. So none of its shots were up to date. 

After all this is sorted,  we make a call to the local police department to see what has to be done legally. They can't do much, cause its a per issue. But they pointed up in the way of I want to say animal control. But I may be mistaken. Anyways a particular department that deals with this in this state. 

They tell us we should watch the dog for rabies since the shots weren't up to date.  And could do this two ways. 

1. Let the guy keep his dog, and see if he tells us if the dog acts oddly.

2. Impound the dog for 10 days, which will cost him $45 a day. (Dog would be the. Returned to the owner)

With this guys tendency to lie to us, and curse my mother out. We opted to impound the dog. Costing him $450 + in this state we can send the hospital bills to him. Since his dog bite our daughter. We opted to do both. 

If he was just open and straight forward with us from the beginning, we may have just let him slide a bit and ask if the dog was okay or acting strange. Saving him the fees. But nope, you made this man's daughter and mom cry.

Edit, this has blown up more then expected. And a lot of angry people. 

And should have mentioned in the original post. She was 10, and usually good with dogs. Let them sniff her hand..etc etc. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6jde2h/guys_dog_bit_my_daughter_then_was_a_lying_jerk_so/,pettyrevenge,421,
2017-06-25 01:05:26+00:00,6014,"Girl bullies and beats up my sister, I make sure the popular kids hate her next year",kylablythe1,"Happened a few days ago, still grinning about the look on this girl's face.

I want to start by saying that my little sister isn't very popular. She's not great at being social, she doesn't wear popular clothes, she has blue hair. She's very anxious around people, but she's one of the sweetest girls ever. She's in eighth grade. Kids are shits, so this year's been hard for her.

One girl in particular targeted my sister. This girl had been spreading rumors about her, and after a while, it started getting around that she wanted to fight my sister. Being the anxious girl she is, my sister never told a teacher. (The school is terrible anyways, the teachers would have never stepped in.) Later that day, this girl attacks my sister. Everyone crowded around them while she suddenly started punching and kicking my little sister. One boy stepped in, literally throwing the other girl off of her. This has had a major effect on my sister's mental health. Her grades dropped and she started panicking before each school day. If I could, I would have done far worse to this girl. However, my sister begged me not to, saying that she just wanted it to be left alone.

Fast forward a few weeks later. The eighth graders come to the high school I go to as some sort of orientation for when they're freshmen next year. I was eating lunch with my friends, many of which happen to be very popular at the school (they're on the student body, so they're also involved in a lot of school decisions.) They're well known at the middle school, too. A group of eighth graders come up to our table, and we're supposed to help them out with any questions they have. They noticed that many of the people there were popular, and were trying to hang out with cool older kids I guess.

I recognize the group instantly as the girl and her friends who ganged up on my sister. For some reason, she doesn't recognize me.

They start talking to us, and it's obvious that they're trying to make themselves sound cool. The  'ringleader' girl asks, ""Do any good fights go down here?""

I stared at her and said, ""No, people here have better things to do. It's sad when someone attacks another person for attention.""
My friends agreed. ""It's disgusting,"" one girl said. ""I hate people who do that. It's so disgusting.""
I'm still staring at her when I say, ""Actually, something like that happened to my sister down at (middle school). People that do that kind of thing are just sad. It's not welcome here.""

That's when she recognizes me. Her face went tomato red. Her friends chimed in, glancing at her every now and then.
""Yeah, I heard about that, I can't believe people still do that.""
""I hate people like that!"" Another one of the eight graders exclaimed.

The girl mumbled that she had to go to the bathroom and stood up, obviously waiting for her friends to go. They just kept talking to us, so she awkwardly walked there alone. After the eighth graders left, I explained what happened to my friends. Looks like she won't be getting along here next year at all.

Edit: Wanted to add that yes, the panic attacks were a side affect of PTSD from when she was attacked. She already had anxiety, but this added to it, as well as other affects. But my sister is getting help and we're working through it! Also, my mom did press charges, despite my sister's protests. Nothing really came of it though.

2017-06-21 16:51:43+00:00,2039,Slap my dog will you?,ThatSwolGuy,"Last summer my girlfriend and I decided to head up to the local reservoir with some hiking with our dog. It was a beautiful drive up  and the day seemed like it couldn't get any better. 

As we pulled into one of the parking lots we notice a pickup truck blaring country music and its owner (We'll call him Loud Dick-LD) getting his fishing gear ready. Okay no big deal. We start our hike enjoying the sunny day. On the tail end of our hike we notice we're coming up on LD. Here's where it gets interesting. As I said earlier, we had our dog with us. She's a small dog a mix of a few breeds but she's about 30 pounds. She was on a leash but we were coming up on a point where the trail narrowed with a cliff on one side and the shoreline on the other. As we approach LD says ""Your dog bites me and I'll shoot that little bitch"". Keep in mind this is in Wyoming where everyone and their uncle has a gun. My girlfriend and I are shocked at his blatant rudeness but let it go. As we walk past our dog gets excited to see a new person and starts pulling towards him.   As she gets within arms reach of LD he slaps her in the snout. Oh fuck no. I decide a physical confrontation won't do anyone any good so I do my best to comfort my dog and keep walking. The rest of the walk back I was wondering what I could do get this asshole back. We get back to the car and I see LD's truck. Then it hits me. I pull out my keys and flatten all 4 of his tires by releasing the air through the valve stem. Have fun with 4 flats and no cell service asshole.

2017-06-19 20:41:28+00:00,3116,"How 10 minutes resulted in a $1,000 loss...",nsrtesla,"First-time poster, TL/DR at bottom as it's a long post.

About 6 years back, I was on my way to my parents one night (who live in another state), and I stop at a bridal store in my state to order my bridesmaid's dress.   I'm wearing a pair of old jeans, and I didn't pack any others because my intent was to take my mother out shopping the next morning, and I was going to pick up a few pairs of jeans then.  Specifically I was going to go that chain store with another name for blue in the title, as they were having a sale on their jeans for $20.  

I'm getting dressed after my fitting, and because I'm an unbalanced idiot, I step on the right pants leg while trying pull the jeans up, and make what was a small rip into a big one.  A huge ""from the top of the back right pocket to back of knee"" rip.   Yeah, not embarrassing at all.   Thank goodness I was wearing decent underwear.

But wait...chain store has a location few doors down (this is one of those outside plaza kind of places), and I still have 15 minutes before they close.   

I hurry down (as much as my trying to keep my pants closed with one hand walk will let me) and reach the door.  Locked.   I try all the doors... all locked.  Look at the sign, it says they close at 9pm, but it's 8:50.   Yeah, I know it sucks to get last minute customers, but I'm just gonna be in and out for a pair of jeans, and I'm happy to tell the workers that...if they come to the door.  But they won't.  They just look at me.

I call the store (seriously don't want to have to drive 3 hours in ripped jeans, and I know I'm going to have to stop for gas at one point, where I'm sure I'll be positioned just right for the security camera to catch a view of my ass, and OMG could you please just open the door!!!) and the hours are definitely 9am - 9pm.  No sign saying they were closing early for a meeting or anything like that.  Nope, the workers just decided to close early.

Now I'm pissed off...it's February, it's cold, I gotta 3 hour drive, and I just wanted a pair of jeans.

Get to my parents house, my mother is like, only you, and loans me a pair of pants to wear for the next day.

Go out shopping the next morning, get to the chain store that's near my parents' home, and a thought occurs to me.  I remember I used to buy clothes at this outlet store which I was two hours away, but if I wanted to return or exchange it, I could go to a local store.   One day, I was making a return and the local store clerk was frustrated...she mentioned that she hated the outlet for always telling people they could return at a local store, because people would spend gobs of money, then realize they overspent, and would make their returns at the local store...so the outlet sales numbers looked great, but the local stores' sales / return numbers would look bad because they were taking in all of these outlet clothes on returns.   

Ohhh, yeah!

I go into chain store location with my Mom, and confirm that yes, I could return chain store purchases at any location.  And yes, they would have to pay me back the sales tax that I paid, not the local sales tax (my parents' state sales tax was a full 1.2% higher than local store's sales tax - tee hee)!

The poor sales clerk just KNOWS I'm about to return something to her from another state.   Instead, I smile sweetly and hand her 51 pairs of jeans.   I took all different sizes so I wouldn't completely wipe them out of a particular size, hey, it wasn't their fault.   1 pair for me, and 50 pairs for later.   I assure her I will not be returning these to her store, and I thank her for her time.  If I'd had the money, I would have bought more, but I only had enough temporary spare money to cover the 50 pairs.

Get back to my local store in my state the next day.  Confirm again that they were supposed to be open until 9pm on that fateful evening, and that means they are supposed to let you in the store as long as you walk in by 9pm.   

Then I tell them I have a return.  Nope, no need to exchange, I just need my money back.  Here is my ID, my receipt, and my debit card.   Please process this almost $1100 in return, and I'm happy to wait.  Manager wants to know if there is a problem with the jeans, and I say nope, just wanted to inconvenience the store that decided it wanted to close early.  Oh you need to inspect all the jeans...no problem, take your time, I brought a book with me.   

So so so very petty, and because the jean sale had ended, and it was a Sunday, they weren't as busy as they normally were...I know that I made an impact on their bottom line for that day.   Wish I could have bought and returned 500 pairs of jeans, but oh well.  I satisfied myself with that moment of pettiness.

I used to be a front end manager for a large hardware chain in the Midwest. It was early in the day (around 9 am or so) and my head cashier had called in sick so I was already behind in a lot of ways. Luckily I had a girl scheduled who was a former head cashier who had left the company and came back as a full time cashier. We'll call her Jenny. Jenny was smart and worked hard, she was always professional and was quick with a joke. I liked when she was scheduled to work with me.

Jenny was around 7 months pregnant (and had the most awful things said to her because she didn't have a ring on her left hand, but that's another story) and I had given her the phone while I was trying to accomplish various tasks to set up my day.

She stood by the exit doors greeting people and watching the registers to make sure things were running smoothly. She noticed that a customer (a contractor) was coming through with a few rail carts of lumber, trim and various pieces of hardware. The guy had enough items that he had easily been in the store for a couple hours (probably just a few minutes after we opened). Jenny, knowing that this one customer would take a long time to ring up and didn't want to hold the other cashiers up, told me she was going to jump on her register to ring him up, which made sense and I was glad she thought to do it.

I stopped doing what I was doing and took over the post by the door. Everything was going like it should, people were coming, people were going and the registers were running smoothly. Jenny forgot to give me the phone when she jumped on her register, but it wasn't ringing so no big deal. She had been with the customer for around 10 minutes (which didn't seem crazy given the amount of things brought to the register) when it happened.

All of a sudden the smart, funny, always professional Jenny walked away from her register, yelled ""FUCK THIS, I'M OUT!"" burst into tears, threw the phone 15-20 feet and ran out the exit doors.
I was instantly enraged, because while I didn't know what he said, I knew it had to be awful. I didn't know what the problem was but I was about to find out. I marched over to the customer and I'm sure I looked angry I got about a foot away from his face and had the following conversation:

Me: What did you say to her?

Customer: Nothing, I don't know why she got so upset!

Me: (realizing this wasn't true but I couldn't do anything) Well what's the problem.

Customer: She didn't ring me up right.

Me: What do you mean?

Customer: She counted wrong, I've only got X of these boards and Y of these and Z of those. She was trying to charge me too much. I asked her if she could just ring up every item but I was in a hurry.

Me: She didn't ring up every item because you told her you were in a hurry. (instead of scanning each item she had counted and manually entered the amounts)

Customer: But she didn't ring me up right, I don't want to pay more! I just think it would have made sense to ring everything up individually.

Me: (Instantly realizing that I could probably take 30 minutes ringing up the number of items he had and he was in a hurry and he just devastated one of my best employees, I realized I must do this) You know what sir, you're right. It would make more sense to ring up each and every item.

I then canceled out each and every item on the screen, told the guy we were going to make sure we got it right for him and began ringing him up. One by one I rang up each item on all three carts. Twice he told me he was in a hurry and he really needed to go and both times I responded ""I know I just want to make sure we get this right for you."". So 33 minutes later I've rung everything up and double checked each item for accuracy and hit the total button. I had written down the total that Jenny got and quickly subtracted the difference in my head.

Me: Your total comes to $XXX.XX and it's a good thing we went back through everything Jenny was going to charge you an extra $2.78.

Customer: (says nothing, slides credit card.)

Me: Have a great day.

I walked away knowing I had just ruined his day because he was a dick and he asked me to.
Jenny never would tell me what he said to her. I think she was afraid if she told me and he came back to the store I would lose my job. She may have been right.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6h9hpz/why_yes_we_should_ring_up_every_item_xposted/,pettyrevenge,155,
2017-06-13 23:32:34+00:00,2115,Please don't push me and cut in line,peripheries,"So quick backstory. I'm taking a domestic flight in the Philippines. The whole terminal was a mess; one flight cancelled, the rest delayed by at least 2 hours. It's incredibly crowded, not enough seats for everyone, and you can just tell everyone is not their best self at that moment. 

Finally our flight starts to board. They call all the back rows and pretty much everyone floods the gate to board. I hang back for a while seeing if order will be restored, but hop on the bandwagon once I see they're letting everyone on. I'm three people away from getting my ticket scanned and this older gentleman, maybe 50-60 years old, comes up from behind me, pushes me to the side, says ""scuse me"" in a very entitled tone (if that's even possible) and shoved his way up to the front. The young lady checking tickets didn't notice as she was assisting her coworker (2 lines). She scanned his ticket and down the hall he went. No one said anything, myself included. What good would that do anyways. 

I'm fuming by this point.  Hungry, tired and now I've been pushed. Being pushed by strangers is my biggest pet peeve. I'm pretty sure I burned a hole in the back of his head while we waited to board the plane. I know I can't get any revenge, but I just want him to make eye contact. It's all I have at this point. Maybe he'd look back and notice me glaring at him and he'd awkwardly look away. I don't know. 

We get on the plane and he plops his fat ass down in a first class seat; that explains the self-entitlement. Then my opportunity for petty revenge presented itself. A woman was trying to make her way back out of the plane. She was carrying a bunch of food in plastic bags, who knows where she was going. Well she just happened to pass by me as I was passing the first class douchebag. I swung my duffle bag hand carry over my right shoulder and made an exaggerated move to let her pass by, hitting douchebag in the face with my bag. This bag has been on the floor of at least 15 different parts of the airport, including the smoking section where people spit all over the floor. Now it touched his face. Yummy. I apologize to both of them (I crushed the ladies plastic bags with my leg actually accidentally) and keep walking down the aisle. I didn't get a good look at his face afterwards but I'm sure he was very, very upset.

Im writing this on the airplane, way back in coach. Man, that felt good...and the situation never escalated. Personal pettiest revenge. 

TL;DR: Douchebag pushed me to cut in line, I smacked his stupid face with a dirty dufflebag and apologized. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6h3qn7/please_dont_push_me_and_cut_in_line/,pettyrevenge,83,
2017-06-12 23:36:47+00:00,3107,[NSFW] Unsolicited nudes all around.,kindnesskangaroo,"A little background info: My SO knew this girl since they were toddlers and their mutual families were close. He didn't cut her out of his life for her behavior because it would cause more headache than either of us wanted to deal with between families. I'll call her Alice. 

So, Alice is a friend of my SO that was introduced to me when he and I started living together. It was pretty obvious she had a huge crush on him despite having her own SO. I stopped hanging out with her because she would ask me really inappropriate questions about our relationship and wouldn't stop when I'd politely tell her I was uncomfortable. I told my SO about this and he understood. However, her texts through the years to him became more and more inappropriate and she even sent him unsolicited NSFW pictures and videos. He asked her to stop, even distanced himself by not returning her texts or calls. She'd come back around every so often and inevitably it would happen again. She'd also badmouth me to him for no real reason, because she blamed me for him distancing himself. That was his decision because he was with me, and had no romantic interest or attraction to her at all.

Finally, after almost five years of dealing with her behavior, I decided I'd put a stop to it once and for all. One night, she was apparently drunk and decided to drunk text him some fairly raunchy stuff. I picked a photo that didn't show her in all of her ""glory"" but was still salacious enough (think lingerie picture). I posted her phone number and the picture on about 10 different websites asking for dick pics and a fun time. It didn't even take two days before I saw a  post go up about it on social media. She had to change her number because she was so inundated with pictures and was incredibly angry that she'd gotten so many texts. She went on a rant about how awful it was to receive these pictures unwarranted and all I could think to myself was, ""Now you know how he feels."" She doesn't know with certainty it was me, but I have a feeling she knows. We haven't heard from her in three years since then. 

**Edit:** 

I didn't expect this sort of response, but I've appreciated reading the comments (even then not so nice ones)! 

To answer some recurring questions, and add clarification: 

1) ""Why didn't he just block her number?"" He did numerous times in the beginning, but she changed her number frequently. He gave up after a year of that. The only reason they ever had contact was because she'd message him via a new number.

2) ""Why didn't you just show them to her family/SO?"" Simply because I wasn't trying to ruin her life, destroy her relationship, or humiliate her. I tried to speak with her a few times about it and was met with hostility or was ignored. I thought at the time three years ago this was an easy way to make a point. Now, I would probably do just that if someone else did similar because of everything I dealt with with Alice.

**Warning:Long, but totally worth it!**

During freshman year of college I roomed with my cousin and our friend Dan. The three of us happened to be quite the marijuana enthusiasts and enjoyed smoking...a lot. As great a luxury cannabis is, it wasn’t cheap, especially to three college kids. So naturally, when we wanted to smoke together we’d all chip in an equal sized nug so no one ended up getting short-changed and to obviously save a little cash here and there. As time went on, Dan began to run out of money due to his constant smoking. No money=no weed. So what went from rolling a spliffs everyday suddenly became smashing  bowls and scraping resin off the shards of glass and mixing it with tobacco to get high. In our very small and cramped room, I had a mason jar filled with a baggie of my weed hidden in a spot that NO ONE (I thought) knew about. After class one day, I wanted to sit back and enjoy a smoke when I pulled my stash out of the hiding spot to find that the weed was missing. Instantly, I knew Dan did the dirty deed. My cousin wasn’t struggling too bad financially at the time so it couldn’t have been him. But before I pointed any fingers, I decided to wait it out and be 100% positive.

When Dan came back after class, I noticed he was more nervous than usual and didn’t make eye contact with me when we were shooting the shit . Red flag 1. Per usual, he’d throw his jacket on the floor, like he did with any other piece of clothing, and started to make ramen noodles. While he was busy, I slowly lifted the jacket with my foot to reveal the top of a baggy with a few nugs poking out of the inside pocket. Red flag 2. I’m not a big fan of thieves, so I decided to get my revenge on Dan in a very petty way. Just to let you all know, Dan is a very gullible human being and tends to believe anything, even if it’s a little far fetched...

One day, my roommates and I planned on having a Netflix night with a bunch of our friends later on in the week. Me being me, saw this as an excellent opportunity to do something devilish, but “What devilish thing should I do?” At the time, there was an Iphone app called Xbox Smartglass that had just come out (I think). Basically, one would log in their Xbox Live account information, connect their phone to the Xbox, and control basic things like direction (think directional pad) and clicking the “A” or “B” buttons. 

With this newfound information, I knew exactly what I was going to do, but had to bank on doing it **right**.

The Netflix night comes and all 10 of us are outside finishing up a spliff before we head back in. I, however, excused myself early to go to the “bathroom”. During this time, I quickly went inside my room, turned my Xbox on, connected my phone to Smartglass, and left it on my bed (it would disconnect if you were too far away). A few moments pass and we are all jam-packed into the room. Dan and I had bunk beds on the right side of the room. He had the top bunk and I had the bottom. My cousin, Gucci, had his own bed on the left side of the room. Everyone else was squeezed in the middle. What’s perfect about my position is that I could conceal my phone very well with no one being the wiser. 

Dan had the controller and began sifting through possible movies to watch. I started off with clicking to the right, left, up, and down every so often making it appear that Dan was fucking around with the controller.

“Yo Rivy, I think your controller is busted.” said Dan.

I obviously told him it wasn’t and that he’s scrolling through everything too fast.

So I continued to fuck around more and more until I started moving everything faster and faster. Naturally people were like, “Dan! Stop being a dick!” He responded by letting go of the controller to show that it wasn’t him and everything was indeed moving on it's own. Everyone was confused. This being the right moment, I stopped for a few seconds….then slowly shifted down to the “Horror” section, scrolled to the right until I saw the movie conveniently titled “Hell” and clicked on it. 

Everyone screamed and hollered. Dan jumped out of his bunk, nearly crashing into everyone, and ripped the plug right out of the  Xbox. As he turned back, I could see the look of true fear in his eyes. Everyone was scared shitless and the commotion caught the attention of the RA. It was painfully hard trying not to laugh during this whole ordeal.

Our room was the talk for the entire week. Dan was going around telling everyone, “Yo man, our Xbox is fucking haunted/possessed…” 

From friends, to classmates, RA’s and even the hall janitor, Dan told EVERYONE. He was so infatuated and scared, I decided to keep going with it. It got so crazy that Dan, and I swear to God I’m not lying, would talk directly to the Xbox as if it was a person. He’d ask it questions like “Who are you?” “Are you a kind spirit?” “Can you communicate through other forms of technology?”

This was absolute gold.

Before you know it, I started communicating with Dan by typing on the keyboard for Xbox live messaging. I got more daring and wrote words like: 

“Dan”….”Death”….”Car”...”Demon”...”Hell”. 

I also wrote places he would be that day, clothes he was wearing, people he knew, etc. 

He was too busy freaking out that he never took a moment to logically think about the whole situation. Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine pranking someone this bad….especially with an inanimate object. I do want to note that my cousin found out about my prank/revenge due to the fact that he saw “Smartglass Connected” pop up on the Xbox dashboard. I told him everything and he promised not interfere and encouraged me to continue on :). 

One day after class, I walked into my room to find Dan sitting upright on his bunk staring into space. I asked him what’s up and he went on about how scared he was and how he believed someone was hacking the Xbox and sending him threatening messages. He also believed that whoever was doing it was also hacking the webcam too (lol). Dan went on and on and even considered calling the cops (yikes).  Realizing how out of hand this was getting, I stopped fucking with him for a little while. 

Overall, I kept my vengeful prank a secret for a few months before I finally told him. He was livid at me and firmly believed someone….or something was out to get him. But he did admit to stealing my weed and soon paid me back. A word to the wise, never steal from someone, you never know what appliance will become possessed and haunt you ;)

**TL;DR: College roommate stole weed from me. I got my revenge by making him believe our Xbox was haunted.**

I was around 7 or 8, and I was in the washroom when a couple of girls from our group walked in. I guess they didn't realize I was there, because one of them started loudly complaining about my friend. My best friend has developmental dyspraxia. This girl was mocking the way she walked and spoke. She was pretending to stagger around and slurring her words in this ""stupid"" tone.

I was really upset. I was always defensive of my best friend, she was sort of an easy target and people made fun of her a lot. I'm autistic and while I received my fair share of bullying, it was never as bad. Anyway, I was too chicken to say anything and ended up just waiting until they left. The girl who was making fun of my friend, I thought she was really intimidating. She was one of the older girls in the group and we were all a little scared of her.

Still seething, I started to head back to the gym where we held our meetings. As I walked back, I noticed that the bitch from earlier had left her unfinished cream soda by the cubbies in the hall where we kept our stuff. (I should add that this girl was constantly drinking cream soda. I swear she was addicted to that shit or something, because she always had a couple with her.) I looked around, the hallway was deserted. So I grabbed her soda.

I then opened her backpack and poured the entire thing inside.

It got all over her gym clothes and shoes, everything. It was a sticky pink mess. When I was finished, I just zipped up her bag and went back into the gym like nothing had happened. She didn't realize until after the meet had ended. My dad had just picked me up and we were about to leave the school when I heard her freaking out from all the way down the hall. Her mother thought the girl must have accidentally put the soda in her bag without noticing it was open. She swore up and down that she didn't, but her mom didn't buy it. No once suspected a thing, though I made sure not to stick around. To this day it remains my fondest memory from girl scouts.
 
TL;DR - I overheard a bully making fun of my best friend's dyspraxia at girl scouts, so when no one was looking I poured her cream soda in her backpack.

2017-06-02 20:39:24+00:00,9911,/r/IDon'tWorkHereLady recommends I tell this story here.,RRuruurrr,"I work on a college campus. It's the season for orientation and parents are herding their kids around checking out the school. I misread my schedule (arrived at 14:00 instead of 4:00 pm) and had a few hours to kill. I decided to take a walk around campus to look at the changing trees. I soon came upon a family that was clearly lost. two parents and a kid. The dad's got the map out (upside down) and the mom is asking anyone who will listen for directions. I decided to help.

I stroll up and ask where they're headed and am told they're looking for one of the libraries. It wouldn't be too far out of my way so I decided to take them there. As we're walking I make small talk asking what the kid plans to study and whatever. To be helpful, I started pointing things out on the way. This was my fatal error.

As we're walking someone interrupts and says ""are you headed to the library?"" I confirmed that we were and allowed them to tag along. I didn't go full tour guide and turn around, so as I'm walking I remain facing forward. I didn't notice that a few other families started following behind me. We get to the library and the first family is happy. I turn to leave and someone says ""how about the political science department?"" I check my clock, and think ""what the hell, these people are nice"" and off we went.
At this point I have about five families with me. People are asking questions and laughing at my jokes and having a good time.


We get to the next building and it's time for me to leave for work. I motion to disband my little entourage and am met with opposition. ""Take us to the English department."" Some guy says. I was like ""no can do, chief. I gotta go to work"" and it clearly didn't register. I tried to tell him that this was an informal tour and I'm not affiliated with the orientation and he didn't understand. ""What the hell kind of tour is this? We paid good money for this orientation. You're going to take us to the English department!"" Imagine Mark Derwin's character from Accepted. The English department was actually pretty far away so I wouldn't be able to get him there without being late to work. He was pretty disrespectful so I decided to dump him instead.


""To get there it's easiest to take a campus shuttle"" I said ""I'll walk you to the bus stop."" He was satisfied with that so off we went. We get to the bus stop and I tell him that I won't be riding with him because I'm only a tour guide for this particular area. Once he gets on the bus he should wait three stops, then get off and meet a new tour guide that will be there waiting. Instead of saying thanks he grumbles out a ""was that so hard?"" and climbs aboard.

Here's the kicker. Our campus doesn't have its own bus system. I put him on a city bus. Three stops would take him to a grocery store a mile or two off campus. There definitely wasn't anyone waiting for him there. I like to think he got what he deserved for being disrespectful.

tl;dr I decided to help a family that was a little lost. Eventually people joined our group and expected me to give a campus tour. They got pissed when I had to bail so I put them on a bus to nowhere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6ex0i6/ridontworkherelady_recommends_i_tell_this_story/,pettyrevenge,318,
2017-05-30 21:35:46+00:00,3640,A Little D for a Big Asshole,freckles42,"When I was in eighth grade, my middle school French class took a trip to Québec City. My school was in the whitest part of whitest Connecticut and I had moved there a few years before from Atlanta. You can imagine the Izod-style culture shock I went through.

In any case, we were up in Québec City in February, for some awful reason. Probably because the prices were cheapest for hotels, I don't know. I do remember it was cold and windy and snowed a lot.

I was a pretty geeky kid, unsurprisingly. I read *Star Wars* expanded universe novels during the morning reading period. I had disappeared into fantasy worlds after my brother died a few years before, just months after we moved to New England. Since my brother had died and I was a new kid, no one really knew how to be my friend. Some people were nice to me for awhile, but most ignored my existence. 

One of the few people who took pity on me was the daughter of my church's minister, who was in the same year as me. She'd invite me to eat lunch with her and her friends, even though I could tell her friends did not want me there.

Despite growing up speaking French, I was placed in introductory French -- and never moved, because there was so much going on with my brother's accident and eventual death that no one really bothered with my education. Thankfully, my French teacher was kind and would let me help lead the spoken French bits in class. This one boy liked to hang out after class and would mock me after I left, pinching his nose and doing his best ""make fun of the French"" accent. He liked to make my life hell in other ways, like stealing homework, tearing pages out of schoolbooks, or shoving my shoulder whenever he ""bumped"" me in the hallway. I had dealt with worse bullying before, so I mostly just tried to ignore him. His was never very serious, but it was *constant.*

In any case, I asked these girls I ate lunch with if I could room with them on this trip. I did not want to be randomly assigned somewhere. They grudgingly agreed to it.

Once we got to Québec, things changed. Our teachers told us we were allowed to explore the city in small groups and we were to use French *only* when interacting with shopkeepers and the like. Well, the girls I was rooming with quickly realized I was the only student in our class who actually spoke French. I helped my roommates order things at bakeries and make change and navigate around the city. Word quickly spread and by the end of the first day, several classmates came to me for phrases they could use.

On the second day of this trip, we were all supposed to meet up in this square in the old city at a particular time after being allowed to wander for a few hours. My group turned up a few minutes early and a group of boys -- with my favorite harasser -- was already there. The boys were clearly planning some kind of prank; there was a lot of stifled laughing and looking our way. The harasser came over to our group. He asked me how to say, ""Are you my mother?""

Well, for those who don't know:
&gt; ""Es-tu ma mère?"" means ""Are you my mother?""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Es-tu ma mer**d**e?"" means ""Are you my shit?""
&gt; 

Can you guess which one I told him? He had never paid attention in class, so to his ears (and the ears of our classmates), it sounded right. And no one would ever suspect quiet, mousy, geeky me of any shenanigans.

He went up to a stranger and asked her if she was his shit just as one of our teachers came around the corner. He got hauled by his ears, the teacher apologizing profusely to the woman while simultaneously scolding my harasser. Kid immediately tried to blame it on me but his protestations were immediately dismissed. The teacher did check with everyone, but no one had heard the difference in the language used so backed up my version of events.

He had detention for the rest of the trip and was not allowed to participate in any of the activities. He had to sit on the bus and write an essay.

He was far more cautious about being an asshole to me in the future. 

tl;dr: bully tried to be a smart-ass in French on a class trip; I added a letter and changed the meaning of a word, which got him in huge trouble. No one suspected me of anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6eae40/a_little_d_for_a_big_asshole/,pettyrevenge,139,
2017-05-28 23:51:35+00:00,2534,Be an unreasonable c***? Fear for your son's life.,AwwItThinksItsPeople,"I've been working in the skydiving industry for a number of years (because my husband is a tandem instructor) and recently our current drop zone has been short-handed, so I started learning to do manifest. 

Side note: doing manifest is basically figuring out which tandem instructor goes with which student, which is more complicated than it sounds when you're at a large DZ and the many instructors have large egos. End side note.  

Today was my second day in the manifest office, and I made basically the biggest mistake I could make: I missed two people and they weren't on the load sheet. I realized this only a few minutes after the sheet went out, when the mom of one of the jumpers came striding up to my window and demanded answers.  

My manager and I did some quick recon and figured out what had happened, and I added the two missing jumpers to the last load... which, based on the order they checked in, would have been the load they were on *anyway*. And I apologized for my mistake and explained that I'm new. Nope, unacceptable. This ""let me speak to your manager"" haircut bitch proceeded to ask for a discount for her inconvenience, tell us she was going to leave a scathing review mentioning me personally, ask for my name, the manager's name, the owner's name, the email address where the owner could be reached, and just generally made her displeasure known in a really shitty, aggressive way. She was basically screaming at me by the time she gave up and I got to slam the window shut and have a little rage-cry.  

Then it was time to figure out which instructor was going to jump with her special snowflake son. It just so happened that my husband was up! I waited until just after hubs had finished his ground interview video with the snowflake (because I knew bitch-mom would be watching like a hawk) before I waltzed out and gave him a lingering kiss. I also whispered some unimportant work info in his ear while looking at her.

Watching her realize that her precious baby boy's life was in the hands of a man who was, at the very least, sleeping with the girl she just screamed at... let's just say it was satisfying.

2017-05-28 11:23:55+00:00,2553,Up close and personal with annoying shoppers,RockMoss,"At one time I lived in a shitty apartment in a very fancy part of Montreal. The grocery stores near me were either small organic independent shops, or one large but expensive grocer. We're talking prices like $5, on sale, for a single red pepper. What I saved in rent went to my food budget. 

The stores could charge this amount because their regular customers were very well off. Rich Montreal Quebecois have a certain air about them. Rude, aloof, and full of themselves. Going shopping was a lesson in patience until I learned how to amuse myself and not get flustered.

For some ungodly reason, the grocer was the socializing spot for these rich people. Every isle had groups of people chatting away with each other or had people on their phones. They would be sort of polite and hug the walls, but they would never move from their spots. If I needed a can of chickpeas, I'd point behind them and politely say excuse me. So meek and unassuming- my downfall. They would hold up a finger and imply that I should wait until they were done. They were never done.

After months of trying to get my shopping done in a reasonable amount of time, I had enough. If they were going to be rude, I would be too... but in the pettiest and most uncomfortable way possible. My new attack plan was this. I would ask to grab the item, and if they didn't move, I would grab it anyway! But oh no, I wouldn't just push past. I got way up in their personal space. I would step as close as possible, with my face right next to theirs, and reach with my arm on the other side of their head. We might as well have been kissing, it was that close. Then I'd move on and continue my shopping. 

I made it a game- how uncomfortable I could make them but still be as respectful and polite as possible. 10/10 would recommend.

2017-05-26 18:44:08+00:00,2924,Don't have to worry about a wait time anymore.,chromaticality,"The company I paper-push for sells parts for heavy equipment. We've had a customer calling in the last couple days screaming at our sales department about a part that he ordered that needed to be brought in from overseas, roughly a 2 week wait time. He was warned of the wait time when he placed the order, but seemed to think we should be getting it for him much faster.

This customer has always had temper issues but it's never been quite this bad.

Not my problem until yesterday, when he physically came into the office. The main guys were busy so he got shunted back into my office so I could track the part and give him another ETA. When I told him the ETA hadn't changed and it was still a week out, he started going off on me. Redfaced and screaming that the machine was down and they were losing money on the job. Called me a cunt at one point.

I waited for him to stop screaming, then said, ""Okay, give me a second to make a call and I'll see if I can't fix this.""

I sent him out to the lobby to wait, picked up the phone and called his boss. When I was in high school, his boss was the scout leader for my little brother's troop. I was friends with his daughter and went over to their house a couple times a month. So we spend a couple seconds with long-time-no-see pleasantries, and then I say, 

""So Boss, I've got your guy [name] here in my office very upset about not getting this part that he ordered a week ago. I know you guys need it but he was warned about the wait time, and I really don't like being called a cunt at work. What can we do to fix this?""

Boss goes 'He fucking WHAT?!""

Story comes out that the guy was warned about this part needed to be replaced a month ago but waited until it was completely broken to order it, and then lied to the boss that the reason for the delay was that my company had forgotten to order it. 

The boss apologizes to me, says he'll deal with it, and hangs up. Out in the lobby, the guy gets a call on his cell phone and answers it, gets this awful look on his face, then leaves without a word to the rest of us.

Boss called me back this morning to apologize again and say he fired the guy. Thank goodness for small-town connections!",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6diuyj/dont_have_to_worry_about_a_wait_time_anymore/,pettyrevenge,68,

I'm sitting there watching the rain, thinking about whether I should get grilled chicken or just go for the double burger, when a work truck cuts in front of me.

I raise my arms in sheer disapproval, and he has the nerve to flip me off.

The bird.

Not cool at all.

Since it's raining, I realize the indoor line is probably short, so I pull into a parking space. I jog into the restaurant to find that the line is only two people long. Super stoked. After a short wait I have a yummy grease-bomb burger in hand. I get back into my car and see that truck dude is still in line. That alone feels good, but I really want him to *know* I got my food before him. Out of principle.

So I time out blocking him in as he exits the drive thru. Innocently, you know? Heh. 

I should tell you that when I'm really happy in life . . . like *really* content in the moment, I laugh uncontrollably. I let it out like a suffocating pig gasping for breath. It's a spectacle even without the sound effects.

I laugh that hard in front of this guy -- the frowny-faced truck fucko -- for about 15 seconds. His look of anger turns to confusion and settles into acceptance. I've had my moment -- I've seen all shades of defeat -- so I carry along and enjoy my goddam double cheese burger.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6da83e/im_in_a_long_line_at_the_drivethru/,pettyrevenge,156,

My mum would sometime put a small box of  raisins in with my lunch.  We weren't that well off and a little box of raisins was a treat to me.

Well they kept disappearing and I knew they had been there and I would be looking forward to eating them at recess.

I informed the teacher and found out that a lot of lunch food was going missing.

Next assembly the principal said that whom ever was stealing the food had better stop as it was a serious offense, but that if anyone was truly hungry to go see her and she would not punish them for the previous thefts and that she would get them something to eat. She really meant it as well. 

So it continues and it was always the best stuff in the lunchboxes that went missing.

My mum had had enough of this by now and decided to punish the culprit herself.

Next day she says don't eat your raisins if they don't go missing and she substituted the raisins with our pet rabbits poo.

Well they go missing and the teacher found a pile of vomited rabbit poo in the cloakroom.

Never found out who was stealing my raisins but it never happened again.

Now I had already caught onto the fact that she was just outright using me for her own gain. She barely ever talked to me outside of class or school, only invited me to stuff where she would get something from me (like her birthday party), etc etc. 
I was kind of quiet and shy at school so I let most things slide, but this was the last straw and I wasn't going to let her use me this time. 
So we had the same maths assignment, and we worked together completing the first super easy part in class. After that, I worked on it by myself at home for about a week and finished it. 
Anyway I'm sitting in class one day (few days before the due date of the assignment) which is one of the classes I don't have at the same time as this girl. I'm browsing my emails and one pops up from this girl. She says that she was wondering if I could send her my maths assignment so she can ""check that what she's done is correct"". She also says that she's apparently ""pretty much finished"" and just wants to confirm she's been doing the right thing. Red flag, as she's asked to copy my assignments before, but her wording makes me think she's done absolutely nothing and is trying to copy/hand up my answers. 
I completely ignore the email and pretend I never got it, and since she refuses to talk to me outside of class, she can't bring it up. 
The due date arrives and the teacher is getting us to print off and hand up our assignments. I hand up my fully completed one and sit down to watch what this girl will hand up. Much to my petty delight, she doesn't print off anything and just sits at her desk. 
To then make it even better, the teacher actually calls her out in front of the class asking where her assignment is, and she has to admit she hasn't finished it/done any of it. 
The teacher tells her to go print off what she's done anyway and when she comes back from the print room she hands up one mostly blank page with a title and one small table. 
I'm absolutely revelling in this, and now I think back on it, I totally should have turned to her and said sweetly, ""I thought you had almost finished it? :)"" (shit eating grin included). 

Tl;dr girl tries to use me for answers to assignment, gets called out in front of class, hands up almost nothing. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6c7zgf/friend_asks_me_if_she_can_copy_an_assignment/,pettyrevenge,123,

Tried calling back, no answer. My caller ID identified them as POTENTIAL FRAUD.

2017-05-17 21:39:40+00:00,2255,Tales of Delicious Revenge from a Recovering Retail Worker,DeliciousRevenge,"I discovered this sub a while ago and it has breathed new life into my withered soul. Today, it's time that I return the favor. 

These tales of petty revenge all took place over the three long years that I had the misfortune of working retail at a big-box store best known for its red bullseye logo and bitchy middle-class clientele. Enjoy.

**ONE: THE TAG SWITCHER**  
I was working in the fitting room one night when this lady bustles in with 3000 different items of clothing that she wanted to try on. Unfortunately my store had just lifted the item limit for the fitting room, so I begrudgingly had to let her take everything back.

She proceeds to make a HUGE mess in the fitting room (leaving clothes inside-out all over the floor, tags ripped off of items, size stickers peeled off and slapped onto the wall… the whole nine yards).

After she leaves, I report the ripped off tags to Assets Protection (per fitting room policy) and, figuring that would be the extent of my revenge, I resigned to cleaning up the mess she left me.

Then I get a call from the manager. He wants me up at the registers to do back up. I had worked the registers before, but it was exceptionally rare for me to get pulled away from the fitting room to do backup. Still, I don’t protest and I head up to the register. 

Guess who my first customer is? Yep, the mess-making bitch from the fitting room. The manager has directed her straight to me, and I can tell from the wide-eyed look of horror on her face that she realizes she has just been lead into a trap.

She slowly begins to plop her items onto the conveyerbelt and tries to make nervous small-talk. At first I assume she’s just feeling awkward about the mess that she left… but when I get a better look at her items, I immediately realize there’s something much fishier going on.

Her purchase consists entirely of women’s clothing, and I recognize most of the items as brand new stuff that has recently come in. Stuff that should cost full price. So when I see nearly every single item’s price tag covered with a bright red 70% off clearance sticker, I realize that something’s up. When I look down at the first item from her pile, my suspicions are confirmed: the item I’m holding in my hands is a woman’s Mossimo Black clothing item, but it has a bright blue Circo tag that belongs on infant boy clothes.

Busted! This bitch was switching tags on clothes to get a lower price! Not only that, but she was so brazen (or stupid) that she used tags from the wrong department!

I don’t make it immediately obvious that I’ve figured out her scheme. Instead, I think fast. From my experience in the fitting room, I know every item of clothing has a little white tag on the inside that has a nine-digit item code. So instead of scanning the items, I proceed to type in each and every item manually, using the ACTUAL numbers inside each garment.

The woman watches this all unfold with a nauseous look on her face, as item after item rings up at full price ($19 - $29, compared to the $2 or $4 price tags she had stuck on each item). As her total grows, so does the look of combined hatred and fear on her face.

Finally she stammers something about “coming back later” and runs off towards the exit. The Assets Protection guy watches her walk out, then comes over to me. He reveals that he had been watching this chick before she even went into the fitting room, but he didn’t have enough on camera to approach her. Since I was the only team member working that night who was familiar with the clothing / tags, the manager put me on the register to check her out.. literally!

**TWO: THE PHONE SHOPPER**  
It’s the week before Christmas and the store is frantic. I’m manning the phones (which are ringing off the hook), and one night I get a call from Bitch Princess, who wants to know if we have any [insert name of whatever animatronic hatching robot dog toy every kid had to have that year]. 

Now the store’s holiday policy said we could confirm availability over the phone, but we weren’t supposed to put high-demand items (like the barking bird robot thing) on hold for a customer. Regardless, I was still un-jaded enough to like hooking people up (I’m still waiting on that lifetime of good retail karma to kick in…)

I let BP know that this highly-coveted toy has been flying off the shelves for weeks and I’m doubtful that we have any in stock, but I can happily check for her if she’s willing to go on a brief hold. She impatiently agrees to the hold, and I set the phone down.

After being slightly delayed by a customer that ambushed me on the sales floor, I miraculously find ONE of these stupid toys on the shelf. I grab it and head back to my post, excited to tell BP I just saved Christmas, but when I get back I find the phone ringing again. Recognizing the number on the caller ID display, I quickly deduce that Bitch Princess has hung up and is now calling back.

I barely get a chance to recite my scripted greeting before BP cuts me off, yelling that I put her on hold for “30 minutes” (more like 7), that she’s a customer and it’s my job to assist her, some nonsense about her having priority over the customers in the store, blah blah blah. I want to point out that literally NONE of what she’s saying is true, but I keep my lips sealed.

Instead, in a ridiculously pleasant voice, I say: “ma’am, thank you SO MUCH for your patience. I checked the sales floor and couldn’t find [stupid toy], but the computer is telling me that we might have one in the backroom. If you bear with me for another minute here, I can—”

She grumbled that yes, I could check the backroom, but I “better hurry” because she doesn’t have time for this. Smiling gleefully, I put the phone back on hold and proceed to return [stupid toy] to the spot where I found it on the sales floor. I then spend a nice chunk of time helping out ACTUAL customers in the store.

Eventually I remember that BP is still waiting on hold and I return to the phone. “Ma’am, good news… we do have ONE in stock,” I say. BP immediately barks at me to put it on hold, and a devious Grinch-like smile spreads across my face. “I’m so sorry ma’am, but we’re actually unable to put high-demand items on hold at this time. All I can do is confirm that it’s currently available on the sales floor…”

BP unleashes the wrath of a thousand fiery infernos and demands to speak to a manager. I oblige, transferring her to the closing manager (who confirmed the store policy, before promptly being hung up on).

I was pretty pleased with the turn of events, but the cherry on top came a short time later when BP actually shows up at the store, only to discover that the toy had already been purchased by another guest.

**THREE: THE SHOE SNATCHER**  
It was nearly closing time, and I was tasked with “zoning” (or straightening up) the shoe department for the night. It was nearly impossible for me to get anything done, though, because this obnoxious woman kept making me drop everything to help her shop for shoes for her toddler.

The worst part was that the woman didn’t put anything back where she found it. Instead, she just leaves the shoe boxes strewn throughout the aisle (wtf). She finally leaves, and I drag myself over to the massive mess that she’s left behind.

As I’m returning all of the discarded shoe boxes to their rightful locations, I’m popping them open to make sure the correct shoes are inside. When I open one of the boxes, I discover a very sweet sight indeed: a dirty pair of toddler sneakers.

It’s a scam I’ve seen far too many times: someone swaps out a pair of new shoes with their old dirty shoes. Only this time, instead of getting away, I had caught the crook red-handed (or red-footed?)

I tucked the shoebox under my arm and quickly retraced the woman’s steps. Sure enough, I was able to find her in the grocery section. And sure enough, her toddler was sitting in the cart wearing a pair of brand new cartoon character sneakers.

I approached the mom with a giant shit-eating grin on my face and said: “I’m so glad I caught you! You almost left without these!” I held open the box with the dirty sneakers.

The woman had the nerve to pin the blame on her child, playing it off as if her kid had swapped the sneakers. Smh.  

**BONUS: HERE'S ONE THAT'S SHORT &amp; SWEET FOR THE ASS CLOWN IN THE COMMENTS WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS BEING TL;DR**  

Holiday shit always gets marked down to clearance the day after a holiday and people tend to get a little worked up about it. One time, this guy calls the store the day after Easter and asks how much the white chocolate Cadbury mini eggs had been discounted. I told him they were marked down 30% (the standard first mark down) and he's not satisfied with that and hangs up. He proceeds to call back EVERY DAMN DAY to ask for the price, and every time he's rude and weird about it. When they finally get marked down to 50%, I think he'll bite... but nope. Still not cheap enough.

Finally at 90% he's interested and asks me, over the phone, to take every single bag off the sales floor and put them on hold for him. I tell him no (goes against store policy to hold clearance), but since the candy is about to be defected (taken out of inventory), the manager tells me to just do it. So I wheel a cart over to the clearance aisle, and that's when I hatch a plan. 

There are two kinds of candy leftover in clearance: white chocolate Cadbury mini eggs, and white chocolate m&amp;ms. For whatever reason, we have about 50 bags of each. Feeling a spirit of pettiness overtake me, I fill the cart with the m&amp;ms and push it to the front with a 24 hour hold ticket. I wasn't there when the guy showed up the next morning, but I'd imagine he was pretty livid to discover the wrong candy on hold, and then to realize that the actual candy he wanted had been defected out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6brt0c/tales_of_delicious_revenge_from_a_recovering/,pettyrevenge,139,
2017-05-16 23:59:01+00:00,3127,Scream at me at the crosswalk? I'll take my time crossing.,TheEverglow,"So this just happened today.

I was on a run going the route I normally go. There's a lot of traffic lights and intersections, and I know how all the stop/start patterns go for automobiles and pedestrians at this point.

I do try my best to make sure that I obey all stops, and I'll double check even if I have right of way to cross the road.

So today, I'm approaching a 4 way traffic light intersection. I see the traffic light that allows cars to pass through the crosswalk I'm trying to cross turn yellow. Great, this means that I'll have the little white man signal to cross in a second. I slow down and push the button to indicate that I want to cross anyways.

Enter crazy bitch. She's pulling up to the intersection right next to me on a red and is trying to turn right. She did have plenty of time to make the turn because the pedestrian light hadn't turned white yet, and there was no oncoming traffic.

Instead, she slams on her brakes (I was completely on the sidewalk) as if I had just tried to cut her off. She starts screaming at me (I don't know what she was saying as I was listening to music and her windows were up). She gestures at the crosswalk light indicating that I don't have the right of way. She does this for 3-4 seconds and is about to take off when, lo and behold, the pedestrian light turns white as she continues gesturing at it.

So of course I step in front of her car to cross the road. Oops. My shoe laces are untied. Gotta make sure those are tied extra tight. Stand up and realize I'm tired. So I stand there for a second and put my hands on my knees to catch my breath.

Mind you, this is a 20 second crosswalk, so this interaction doesn't last very long. I don't think I've ever seen anyone so livid.

In hindsight, maybe this was a little dangerous because if the lady actually was crazy, who knows what she would have done. There were no other cars waiting to turn right behind her though, so I don't really care.

tl;dr Scream at me for no apparent reason? I'll use up the entire 20 seconds to cross the crosswalk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/6bl7wv/scream_at_me_at_the_crosswalk_ill_take_my_time/,pettyrevenge,149,
2017-05-13 18:49:33+00:00,5745,Think you'll save time not returning your cart? Think again.,JuniorMintSpleen,"First off, I'm handicapped. My mom and I stop by a busy grocery store, where the handicap spots are usually always full. Miraculously, a spot opens up right then. Just as we're turning in to park, some lady decides that the best place to leave her shopping cart is smack dab in the middle of said spot. I look around to see that there are TWO cart pens nearby. My mom honks at the lady and she turns to look at me. I point at the cart, but she just keeps walking and gets into her car. 

So her car is almost directly behind us and the way we're situated blocks her from getting out of her spot. Instead of pulling up to the cart, removing it, and finishing parking, my mom slowly disembarks and returns the cart to its respective spot. At this point I can see the lady getting impatient. She even tries to back up and squeeze through to no avail. When my mom gets back in, I remind her of her unanswered texts. We get some laughs in and we finally decide to pull up into the spot and let her through, but just as we move, a nearby car starts to backup, blocking her in yet again. From her sideview mirror, I can see that she's fuming at this point. When she finally gets out, she speeds out of the parking lot.

Maybe next time she'll think twice about leaving stray carts.

2017-05-12 02:59:22+00:00,3467,One cheeseburger no cheese coming up,demonaspet,"When I was a teen and worked at McD's (usually on grill) there was this girl that would absolutely fly off the handle over anything/nothing all the time. She was tiny, about 16, and probably thought she was a hot-shit princess. I'll call her Ship. She didn't just yell and swear, either; she would actually throw things, punch equipment, go into other stations and knock stuff down, etc. It was crazy. I hated working with Ship and Ship HATED me because I constantly pushed her buttons and made her fly off the handle, especially when the owner was around. How? Pointing out her mistakes, politely asking her what an order she entered meant, or just looking at her silently. Seriously. It was almost fun.

One day Ship was in window 2 of the drive through handing out the food. Window one entered ""cheeseburger-no cheese."" This is a 'grill' order meaning it prints a little slip and you put that slip on the wrapper to show its custom ordered. Now, I know Ship isn't going to grab anything without that little sticker, and she isn't smart enough to think about what the order is for.

I smiled and grabbed a hamburger wrapper and made a hamburger and put it up, leaving the little receipt dangling from the machine next to my head as if I hadn't noticed. Ship is watching me as I make the next order, and the next, muttering to herself, arms crossed, feet tapping, and I can see the pressure building. She's making little noises, stalking away, coming back as the food pile builds. 

Finally she snaps. She stalked over, got inches from my face, and screaming says ""WHERES MY CHEESEBURGER!""

I feign innocence. I direct her to the screen (I cleared that order several orders ago of course) and ask what she means. She grabs the receipt and shoves it in my face, triumphant. ""THIS CHEESEBURGER! MAKE THIS!!""

Without taking the receipt, I ask what it is. ""CHEESEBURGER NO CHEESE!""

""Oh... well what do you call a cheeseburger no cheese?""

She just stared at me dumbly, so I walked over, picked up the hamburger, and showed it to her. She got so angry she punched the backup grill printer off the top of the counter onto the floor (where it broke) and pushed over some other stuff in the grill. I told the owner that night, he pulled the tape, verified she was the one that broke his back up grill printer, and fired her.

Man I hope she's in jail.

Edit: People keep asking why order a cheeseburger no cheese? My guess is that the person didn't order that, they ordered a hamburger happy meal and the cashier didn't know there was a separate button. There also might have been some kind of sale for cheeseburgers or this was the 2 cheeseburger meal, although I'm pretty sure it was only one burger in question. This was 1998-99. I don't remember the menu and register well enough to know for sure why the cashier did it.

  This happened about a week ago and a few other times since. 
  At the lunch period at my school (which allows us to go off campus) I usually go to a nearby gas station with a few friends to get food. Usually I get a simple burger and a soda for the afternoon. 
  Now at this place, I am pretty well known to the employees, and am a good friend with a few of them. I saw that they had a new hire and decided to take my stuff to his isle. After a few minutes of waiting, he was being trained by the manager. I had finally made it to the register. 
   Now on this day I decided I felt like having. A cookie with my lunch. 'No problem' I thought 'I've got some extra money'. So I put it down and this little asshole thought that it was a good idea to scoff and make a comment. I can't remember exactly what he had said, but it was along the lines of ""Do you really think you need that?"" And tried to put it away.
   Now I'm not fat, but I am overweight, but I decided that I had a little shot to fire back. The manager working with him, let's call him Jay, had heard what he said and was staring daggers already into the back of his head. So I simply looked up to him and said:
""Hey Jay, how's the wife?""
  I saw this kids eyes shoot open like dinner plates as he puts it back on the counter. 
"" Her backs' still hurting.""
I walked out of there knowing that that little sucker was doomed. 
  He's now tried it while working with 2 others, as I stated I know everyone there, and I've gotten him in trouble both times.

2017-05-06 19:22:05+00:00,4984,Try to Intimidate my disabled neighbor? I'll make sure you get dropped by your sponsors.,SgtSlaughterEX,"So this ended about four months ago, and still makes me happy whenever I think about it. This might be long sorry.

I've lived in this apartment complex about a year or so and it's pretty nice I suppose. My next door neighbor is an older lady who happens to be disabled. While I don't know the actual extent of her disabilities, I know she needs help from time to time and If I'm around I try to help. She's really sweet and about once a week she'll make me a plate of something homemade to eat since I work nights and really don't cook. Her pork chops and fried cabbage are 🔥.

We both live upstairs and she uses a wheelchair but she can walk up and down the stairs slowly, and if I'm around I'll carry her wheelchair down, but her daughter usually does it. Her daughter picks her up every morning on her way to work and takes her to this community center everyday so she can get out and socialize and such. 

This is where this guy comes in, I like to call him Young Douche. YD is your typical piece of shit in that he is super obnoxious in everything. He drives a suped up Subaru that's really loud and plays his music so loud I can hear the bass from upstairs. Also he likes to park in the one handicapped spot. Our apartments management is super shitty and they don't get involved with anything and refused to get involved with this.

Now before he moved in my neighbors daughter used to park in the handicapped spot to pick up her mom, but since this dickhead started parking there she's had to park in front of his car so she can get her mom. I tried to be nice and left a note on his car but nothing really changed but it was no big deal at first.

One morning I'm asleep and get woken up to this guy just holding down his horn non stop. My neighbors daughter had parked in front of him and he couldn't get out. When I looked outside I could see him get out and start harassing both my neighbor and her daughter. 

I could hear him talking shit so I put some pants on and walk outside and see dude all in the daughters face. She's like 4'9 so he's looking down on her like he's gonna punch her, then my neighbor tried to calm him down and she put a hand on his elbow and he slapped her hand away hard. 

I saw that and ran downstairs but as soon as I opened the gate and he saw me he backed off and got back in his car then started honking his horn again. I waited there until they​ left, then he left, not before he flipped me off while driving away. 

So at that moment I knew I had to fuck with him. My other neighbor knows him and told me about dude. Apparently he's big in the custom Subaru scene and he does shows and shit with his car all the time. He has sponsors that sometimes give him parts and they use his car in their ads I guess. 

Anyway It took me awhile to come up with  some good revenges so I'd do simple stuff. I had expired milk in my fridge because I really don't drink milk often but I like cereal occasionally and just had some, so I'd start putting a little bit all over his car when I got home. After awhile you can smell rancid milk all over it. But that wasn't enough.

I needed a real big Fuck You so my other friend found out he had this big show coming up and dude had a photographer come and take pictures of him with his car. The night before the show​ I go to AutoZone and get the shittiest Decals and bumper stickers I can find and spent about an hour and a half putting these all around his vehicle. When I was done it looked horrible. I even did a swastika of Honda, Ford, Lamborghini and Fiat decals on his hood. While nothing I put wouldn't permanently damage his vehicle, it would take hours to take it all off.


So about 6 am when I guess he was going to the show I hear screaming. He's yelling so loud that some other neighbors go outside and see what's up. When they see it's him they laugh and go back inside.

He then called 911 and they show up but it's not like there's anything they can do. Then the cop actually gives him a ticket for parking in a handicap spot without tags then they left.

Apparently he had to make that show for his sponsors or else they were gonna drop him, supposedly he was hard to work with and it was the straw that broke the camels back.  

Now even after all that, dude STILL kept parking in the handicapped space. Eventually when I got home from work I'd just start throwing trash on his hood. I once threw a chocolate shake at his windshield. 

Seeing this car in the handicapped space every night really pissed me off for some reason. Anyways he eventually moved out . Still hate that guy though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/69n0ab/try_to_intimidate_my_disabled_neighbor_ill_make/,pettyrevenge,236,

I'd finished the wash cycle and had begun the dry cycle and headed back to my room. We are able to monitor the wash/dry cycles from our student link, and I was doing just that. Now the (shitty) way the driers work is that if you open the drier door before the cycle has completed, it will automatically terminate the cycle. I'd been doing some work and looked at the tab where I can monitor the drier and noticed the cycle had ended about 5 minutes ago, which I thought was strange because it had only gone on for about 25 minutes total and it usually takes about 50 minutes. I go down to the laundry room and see my clothes in a wet heap on the floor. Some asshole had decided they didn't want to wait for another drier to become available and took it upon themselves to dump all my shit on the floor so that they could dry their clothes. Luckily for me, as I mentioned, this had only happened about 5 minutes ago, so their clothes were still just beginning the cycle and still very wet (wetter than mine.) 

I took their clothes out, the same as they did to me, only I dumped them all behind the washers where it is very dirty and dusty and probably hasn't been cleaned in years. (almost put them behind the driers but then I thought better because fire) I took my clothes to the laundromat across the street to make sure the other person couldn't somehow escalate things and am now beaming with satisfaction over imagining them at first having no idea where their clothes are and then finding them in a difficult to reach area covered in dust and filth.

I am friends with a few of my exes. This one, however, has been a weapons grade douchebag to me for a couple of years and then threw me and my children out suddenly with nothing but the clothes on my our backs and made a few choice death threats to me. Don't worry, the police are involved. Well, a few hours earlier I went with a police escort to gather the rest of mine and my children's belongings. He was sitting on the couch with his new gf, both drunk af. The officer stayed with them. I went to what used to be our bedroom, packed my belongings quickly, packed my children's things, then released 100 crickets under his bed, in his closet, in his dressers, and in what used to be the childrens' bedroom. I made sure there were more male crickets than female, so they'll be noisy as all hell while attempting to find a mate, and these little buggers will eat anything, wood, clothing, and they're very good at hiding during the day.

2017-05-04 01:48:32+00:00,3787,Hog the washers? We'll see about that,boxpear,"So I live in an apartment building that has a shared laundry in the basement. There are 10 washers and 10 dryers. I had a single load of laundry to do before a flight tomorrow morning. So I headed downstairs with my basket. 

Two machines are running when I get down there. There's also a single couple taking up EIGHT washers to sort their laundry. 

I asked politely if they could divide one of them up into 1/7ths and put it in with their others so I can use a machine. They decline (apparently they have a system...) and tell me to wait however long it takes for the next person to claim their stuff to get the next machine. 

At this point I realize it's time to get petty. 

I wait until they leave and then go hit the pause button on all of their machines. I need to stall. Then I wait for the next washer to free up. I transfer this innocent bystanders ratty old towels immediately, pay for their dryer and leave a note to which dryer it's in. Then I start my washer, and I hit ""run"" on my machine. I wait a few more minutes, and then resume all of their washers. 

They come back down in the 40mins it takes to run and are mildly confused by why their machines are taking longer than usual. They suspect no foul play. By this point my washer is finishing up, so I grab a laundry cart and empty it out. I then proceed to take my laundry and divide it into 8 different dryers (like 2 shirts and a couple socks per dryer lol) and set them all running, one by one, as they watch in bitter disbelief. 

And then I settle down in a chair to watch my $12.50 of petty revenge spin. 

Tl;dr person took up all the washers in the laundry room, so I made them watch as I took all the dryers. 

EDIT: y'all are real hung up on the towels I put in the dryer, so:

No, the towels did not belong to the jerks. Yes, I moved someone else's stuff. The towels were sitting, damp, in the washer and I needed to use it. Yes, I could have just waited, but I didn't. I tossed them in the dryer instead, because if someone took my towels out and left them to get musty, I would be pissed. In any case, I feel like it worked out, because no one ever came to claim them in the time that I was down there, so the owner clearly either forgot or didn't give a fuck. They got free dry towels out of the deal, and I got petty revenge ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/694qj5/hog_the_washers_well_see_about_that/,pettyrevenge,155,
2017-05-03 16:09:23+00:00,2974,I Provoked Some Pre-Pubescent Panic,debbie_upper,"A long time ago when one of my kids was in elementary school, I volunteered to chaperone the fourth grade end-of-school outing to a pool. The kids were nine or ten years old. My job was to sit in a chair and make sure no one got out of hand. I was seated and quiet and therefore invisible to the kids.

A group of four girls set up camp in front of me. At one point, one of the girls left to do something and the other three promptly started talking smack about her. The ringleader grabbed a paper plate and started writing down, ""Reasons why we don't like so-and-so."" They wrote and snickered and had a grand time at the other girl's expense. Then they tucked the paper plate under a knapsack, linked arms and went off to grab some lunch.

As soon as they left, I snatched the paper plate and buried it deep in a garbage can. When the girls returned, they noticed the plate was gone. Oh, my god! Where did it go?? They started to panic. They asked some other kids if they had seen it. No. They tore the place apart looking for it. Never did find it.

Eventually, the party ended and we packed up to leave. I don't know if any lessons were learned but I certainly enjoyed watching those little bitches squirm for a little while.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/691ac5/i_provoked_some_prepubescent_panic/,pettyrevenge,67,
2017-05-02 08:01:30+00:00,4983,I still don't know if he ever got his coffee,TheFlyingPigSquadron,"I'm not 100% sure this even belongs here and I've posted this story elsewhere so some of you might have read it already.

Some background: I work in a rather specialised area of Forensics. Officially I'm employed by Police Scotland but they tend to let other law enforcement agencies, universities, etc borrow us from time to time. A lot of the time it's for consulting work or guest lecturing but sometimes we're sent to teach training courses.

About 18 months ago I was asked to lecture at a training course for some of the CID higher-ups in an English Police force. It was the first time I'd done anything like it and I was crapping myself. 

I met with the conveners and other officials for dinner the night before my first day, and after dinner and drinks, I was dropped back at my hotel.

So to set the scene; it's about 10pm, I'm all dressed up in my evening wear and I'm sitting at the bar in the hotel lounge. The place is dead, it's just me and the barman so I've taken off my heels and am unraveling my hair having just ordered a hot chocolate. The barman asks if I want mini marshmallows on my hot chocolate. Yes, of course I want mini marshmallows on my hot chocolate. No I don't mind waiting while you run to the kitchen.

So I'm sit there trying to trick my phone into connecting to the hotels WiFi when Angry Man walks in.

He stomped into the room and slammed his fist down on the bar about 3 ft from me and barked out one word:

""COFFEE""

I didn't know it but apparently that attempt at communication was aimed at me; a fact I learned a moment later when Angry Man moved right up next to me, bent over me so his face was practically in mine and barked out again;

 ""COFFEE"".

In an attempt to get away from the screaming coffee man I slipped off the bar stool, putting it between the two of us. Extremely confused and more than a little terrified, it didn't immediately occur to me that he thought I worked there, hell it wasn't even registering that he *wanted* a coffee. He was just repeating it the same way a toddler does when they learn a new word but don't entirely know what it means. 

I'm going to blame the confusion, fear and tiredness for my completely moronic response, which was to parrot the word back at him.

Me: ""Coffee?""

Angry Man: ""COFFEE""

Then he slammed his fist down on the bar again. This time I noticed that he was actually throwing down money.

My brain suddenly came back online.

Me: ""Oh. Eh, the barman should be back in a sec. H-""

Angry Man: ""Get me a coffee. Now.""

Ooooh four new words. Progress.

Me: ""I'm sorry, mate, I don't work here.""

Angry man (shouting now) ""You fucking lazy liar!! Do you think I'm fucking stupid?"" 

Yes, actually, but I'll be keeping that to myself.

Angry Man: ""Get off your fucking phone and get me a shitting coffee""

Me: ""I really don't-""

Cue rant about me being the only person in the lounge so of course I must work there and I was just being lazy and did I take him for an idiot. All while I'm slowly backing away from the bar so he can't pin me between it and the bar stools. Then he throws in this:

Angry Man: ""Do you have *any* idea who I am? Do you have any idea how *important* I am?""

I never got to find out how important this guy thought he was. Instead Angry Man's Friend came wandering in.

He took one look at me; pretty much cornered by Angry Man who is now screaming about how he'll make sure I never work again while I'm trying to calmly tell him to back off and he tries to intervene. 

He took Angry Man by the shoulders and moved him back away from me while asking him what was going on. 

Angry Man: ""This stupid little whore is refusing to serve me""

Me: ""I really don't work here""

Angry Man's Friend: ""She doesn't work here. Let's just all try to calm down""

There was a few moments of Angry Man's Friend trying to calm Angry Man while he ranted about getting me fired until two barman arrived, one of them with my hot chocolate. The presence of the three men distracted Angry Man enough for me to grab my shoes and escape with my chocolatey goodness. 

As I left I could hear him demanding to speak to a manager.

The next day, after being introduced to a lecture theatre full of high ranking CID Officers, I stood and walked to the podium only to be greeted by one guy in the audience laughing *hysterically*.

I just sort of froze trying to figure out the joke. Did I have food on my face? Was my shirt on inside out? 

A quick check confirmed that, no. I'd managed to adult that morning.

A few other people began to chuckle as this guy struggled to get a hold of himself. As he regained control he pointed to his left.

Where a very red looking Angry Man was sitting.

I think it was the sheer relief that he wasn't actually laughing at me that caused me to open my mouth and say to Angry Man;

""Oh did you get your coffee in the end?""

He walked out and I didn't see him for the rest of the course.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/68ruam/i_still_dont_know_if_he_ever_got_his_coffee/,pettyrevenge,305,

I'll steal the only A.,Siedrah,"Background: For one of my business information classes we had a final project in which our groups of 4-6 people had to go through an Access Database and create an in depth business analysis and advertising campaign. The groups were set up at the beginning of the semester and worked on various other projects until the final details were released. The project was pretty intense, and our professor stated only one team could get an A, everyone else got a B+ or lower.   

Somewhere near the middle of the semester my team kicked me out because they thought I was not contributing to the project equally. This was not true, I was contributing equally but it is hard to see the work I do because I do it from home on my desktop, whereas they do it at school on their laptops (mine is broken). When I was informed of this I was *pissed*. They didn't even try to talk to me about it, they just went straight to the professor and had me kicked off. So instead of trying to get back on the team and avoid a lot of work, I buckled down and got to work.  

Come presentation time I brought the most stylish powerpoint I've ever created, dressed professionally, and kicked some ass. After the class ended and everything had been graded our professor sent me [this](https://i.imgur.com/wnJCphW.jpg). Thats right, I got the only A.

Sometimes after I switched to security, when electronics was really swamped, I'd help out for a few minutes. One day, the phone was ringing and I was walking by and randomly answered it.

Sir Scamalot: ""Hello, sir, this is Steam Support services with Valve.""

Instantly, of course, I know this is a scam. I adore valve and played so many of their games too. I can't believe my luck! Of all the calls to answer! Surprisingly he didn't have some weird accent.

Me: ""Oh, uh... what can I do for you?""

Sir Scamalot: ""We've had reports that game keys shipped to your location may have an error that prevents it from authenticating, specifically the game Counter Strike. We need to validate your game keys to see if your affected."" [I forget which CS was on sale then, this was 2008].

Me: ""Oh, what do I do?"" As if I didn't know.

Sir Scamalot: ""Well I just need you to open any copies of the game you have and read me the CD key on the instruction manual so I can verify them with our validation software."" [or on the jewel case, I don't remember that either]

Me: ""Sure thing, can I put you on hold for a minute while I get those?""

Sir Scamalot: [obviously happy] ""Sure!""

So I put Sir Scamalot on hold while I called all the other area stores electronics department and warned them about the scammer and confirmed nobody had taken a call like this earlier. About 15 minutes later, I get back to Scamalot.

Me: ""Thanks for holding, but I can't find any CD keys. I looked all through the book and the packages.""

Sir Scamalot: [annoyed] ""Well sir, just open any copy of Counter Strike and on the-""

Me: ""Oh, COUNTER STRIKE! I thought you said Counting Strikes, that bowling game, ok, hold on!""

Everyone in the department is listening and we all laugh. 10 minutes later, I'm back on the line.

Me: ""Ok, I got what you're looking for! What do you need?""

Now I make him walk me through how to open the box, including interrogating him for 5 minutes about how to do it without breaking the seal, then pretend I can't find the book, etc etc. 

Finally, I'm ready to *read the code!*

First, I read him the UPC. This upsets him. Then I read him a part number from something. Now he's livid. Finally, I ask if he means the code on the book that says ""game key"" and has like groups of four digits with dashes (like he's said probably 50 times already) and he gets excited again.

Oh, ok heres the *game key...*

Me: ""Ok F... like frank. U... like uncle. C... like cat.""

Sir Scamalot: ""Sir, I don't think thats right, normally a code would-""

Me: ""No, its. F, U, C, then K like kite. Next four is Y like yesterday. O like owl-""

2017-04-28 17:12:27+00:00,2196,Second Worst Interview of My Life,JamesOliv,"Some years ago, I had been selling insurance and wanted something a little less salesy. My bank put out an ad for a financial services representative. It was salary plus incentive bonus. No travel. No prospecting. You sat in the bank and the tellers and others would drive referrals to you.

The ad stated requirements of a Life/Health Insurance Agent and two years professional experience. Preferred qualifications were a bachelor's degree and securities licenses.

Cool. I was, at the time, still working on my degree part time. So this looked like a good next step to getting off of the road and stopping with the cold call biz.

HR calls me for an interview and is super friendly. They set up the interview with the hiring manager. I show up at the designated time and place, with my confirmation email in hand, and am told to sit and wait. About five minutes into my sitting and waiting it became very clear that they didn't know where the hiring manager was. The receptionist was calling numerous numbers asking if they had seen her. After about 10 calls, they track her down. And she's trying to discreetly convey that wherever she is is not where she is supposed to be.

They come and apologize, telling me she was stuck in another meeting and will be right out. I sat there for a half hour. I'm about to leave. The receptionist tells me that she will be right with me. Another half hour passes.
Finally, this woman walks in through the outside entrance (so she wasn't even in the building) and approaches me. She takes me into a conference room. The room had various rows of pot lights to light the space. She only turned on the row above where we were seated. So it was just the two of us in a dark room with two lights directly over each of us.

She then starts off by saying ""Well, u/JamesOliv, why should we consider you? You don't even have securities licenses?"" I point out that I have my Life/Health license, the required license per the posting, as well as a Series 6/63 (they also required Series 65 and 7). She continues to make grunting noises like I'm wasting her time as she reads through my resume. Then she begins to get somewhat excited by the fact that I have a degree until she reaches the point where I have an anticipated graduation date. She stops mid-sentence and just ends the interview. Total actual interview time, 20 minutes.

Pretty obvious I wasn't getting the job. However, I was pretty pissed that I wasted over an hour waiting for my interviewer. Even more pissed that she evidently had never read my resume before that moment.
Of course, I cannot imagine working for someone who is that inconsiderate of others time. When HR called me to follow up on the interview I told them all of the above. The Director of HR was pretty pissed off and asked me if I'd be willing to come back in and talk about my experience. Kind of hoping I would parlay this into another job interview I agreed. Instead, I ended up relaying all of it to a VP of Financial Services with the HR Director in attendance. They fired the hiring manager for, I can only assume, a long line of offenses related to being a shitty person. I was only able to ascertain that they fired her because of her LinkedIn updates.

The manager has been helping me, but when I go to pay a sales associate takes over; I guess the manager has been covering for him.  She was good at it, too - she'd persuaded me to get the most expensive of the three laptop models I was thinking about.

Sales Guy starts pitching the extended warranties.  I politely decline; he keeps pushing them.  I decline again, bluntly this time.  He keeps pushing them.  I ask him to just ring the laptops through.  He keeps pushing the warranties, and after this many refusals he should really be letting it go.  But he's still on it, and talking down to me a little at that.

Around this point, the manager (who's still in the department space) comes back and is just hovering behind him out of his sight, monitoring.  He doesn't notice her because the Computers section has its registers toward the middle.

I say this:  ""I've told you a few times that I don't want any extended warranties.  You clearly feel strongly about it; can you explain why?  Maybe I'm missing something.""

The manager's eyebrows go up a bit.

Sales Guy starts some kind of nonsense story about how these laptops in particular can be unreliable and it's better safe than sorry.

I know there is no way he will present a slightly blurry, black-and-white report to anyone in the room - he'll distribute the pretty color ones, and keep the ugly one for himself. I took care to further smudge some of the ink so he can't read the smaller figures, too.

As every driver SHOULD know, but doesn't. The left lane is for people traveling faster and slower drivers should move right to let them pass. 

Now I am sure this is a pretty common problem in every city where you get people who are too clueless, or distracted to actually move over. This causes traffic congestion, and basically makes those shitty commutes that much shittier. 

So as I am going to work, I am doing slightly above 100km/h in the 100km/h zone. I quickly approach some cars in the fast lane doing 80km/h. Unfortunately, there was another car in the right lane matching that speed. They would not pass each other. 

We came by an exit and the car in the slow lane exited. The guy in the fast lane sped up until he got to the next slow car, where he matched again. It was just enough that no one could pass him in the slow lane. 

After dealing with this guy for the better part of my drive, he finally signals to the right lane and the exit. As the long line of cars in the fast lane pass, he is having a grand time laughing and flipping the middle finger. I'm sure he got it back, but what a piece of shit. 

That's when I noticed that he was in a company vehicle. I took note of the company name and website, then continued on to work. 

Once at work I pulled up his website and saw that he was just a small private company. He listed his home address, which is about 45 minutes to the east of the city (along the exit he took). 

I ran across the street to the gas station with one of the few remaining pay phones still in operation. I called him up and asked him to come give me a quote on a massive rush job. I booked the appointment for 10am at a location that was 1.5 hours west of the city. In total, that would be 3 hours each direction. 

He gladly accepted the job thinking it would be a big one. I've never been to the area I sent him.

2017-04-18 22:27:43+00:00,3182,"congrats, your favorite parking spot is now a bike rack",stinkypinky101,"So I'm a security supervisor for a large call center. It's been so nice outside lately I've been doing a lot of parking lot patrols, leaving notes on cars double parked, in handicap without a placard, in lined off spaces. If we manage to find out who owns a car we can report it to HR but they never do anything about it. We're not allowed to actually ticket the cars and we're not allowed to call the police to ticket them. Though anonymous calls have been done in the past.

But this morning was extra special. They recently repaved and lined the whole parking lot. But someone messed up and painted a normal space as a lined off handicap unloading zone, though there are no handicap spots on either side. We get a lot of complaints of people thinking it's their own special spot even though it's been lined off. All this week a certain manager has been parking her little bmw Z3 in the spot and I've tagged it everyday. Today I finally hit a nerve and she threw a fit yelling at one of my guards working the desk. Yelling that her husband is a police officer and she knows she can't get a ticket. Excluding the fact that it's private property and her own company is telling her not to park there. So instead of going to HR I went to visit the facility manager. I pitched the idea to install a bike rack in the lined off spot and he ate it up. When I left this afternoon the maintenance guys were unbolting one from the old parking lot. He said it should be put in tonight while the lot is empty. 

I get to work before most of the employees show up. Can't wait to sit at the picnic table with my coffee in the morning, seeing her face when she finds her special spot occupied permanently. Ahh the little things in life.

TL;DR Don't yell at my guard staff because you can't find a real parking spot. Now your special spot is a bike rack.

UPDATE: facilities came through and did me one better. They installed two handicap signs in both side spots. They will be painting the markings soon. Always be friendly with your maintenance and security folks.

2017-04-18 15:43:20+00:00,2090,Turn About Is Fair Play,I_Arman,"Jehovah's Witnesses can be annoying to deal with. My in-laws will turn off the lights and hide in the back rooms to avoid them; other responses I've heard of vary anywhere from slammed doors to yelling and screaming. For the most part, the only impoliteness comes from the attempted converts, not the Jehovah's Witnesses themselves. If you're trying to spread your beliefs and grow your church, being cruel, or even impolite, is a poor way to do it. Thus, most Jehovah's Witnesses are both eager to please and polite to a fault, all in the hopes that you'll listen long enough to join up.

In the other corner is my dad. I've never met anyone as calm as my dad - someone can be screaming in his face, and he'll just calmly stare back, with just a hint of a smile on his face. And still try to logically argue his point. He has a very logical mind, and absorbs facts through study with ease, as long as it's something he's interested in. Now, my dad is a Christian, as am I; he's read his Bible cover to cover dozens of times, and could readily hold his own in debates with the greatest religious minds. He's willing to discuss scripture with anyone who asks.

A few months prior, Mom had answered the door to a couple of pushy Jehovah's Witnesses. They left their literature, and promised to come back. I guess they thought Mom was an easy mark. Heh. Dad worked afternoons, so he wasn't home at the time. Several neighbors complained about the pushy attitude, and how these specific Jehovah's Witnesses wouldn't take no for an answer, wasting their time. In fact, during Sunday School, dad and a friend of his discussed the Jehovah's Witnesses, and that they would really like to talk with them and set them straight...

One fine June morning, about 9 AM, we got a knock at our door. Dad answered, and to his delight, it was the two Jehovah's Witnesses! And so began the slow revenge...

He invited them in, saying that he was really pleased to see them. They sat down, and Dad began to discuss Jehovah and the Bible with them. At first, he played the fool, offering easy targets for the Jehovah's Witnesses to shoot down or agree with. I was watching from the relative safety of the other room, but I could see the eager expressions on their faces - this could be a new convert! An easy mark!

As time wore on, their faces grew less and less eager. As Dad moved into discussing points in their doctrine, they began edging towards the door. As they stood, Dad stood; he made no move to open the door for them, however, and continued asking them questions. Unwilling to shove past him, they merely stood and answered, hoping that maybe this would lead somewhere. Time wore on; bored with the conversation, I went outside to climb a tree in our front yard. Another pair of Jehovah's Witnesses walked down the road from the north and got into the big van parked in our driveway, then another set, from the south. We live out in the country, so they must have trucked three pairs together to cover more ground in less time. More fool them - no one was going anywhere, today! Our road had a fair number of lot of houses on it, but it's surrounded by fields, so the other Jehovah's Witnesses had nowhere to go.

After an hour and a half, the two men inside had heard enough, and managed to push past dad to the door. Dad was perfectly fine with that; it was a beautiful day outside, and he could finish his point outside. The two men, visibly pale and unable to leave our porch, realized they would not be able to leave without actually saying it. One interrupted my Dad to say goodbye. Unfortunately, his word choice was open to interpretation, and Dad started in on the End Times, and how it pertained to their beliefs. The two men stared at each other, fear and frustration in their eyes, then turned and fast-walked to their van. Dad followed, *climbed into their van,* introduced himself to the other Jehovah's Witnesses there, and continued his discussion. ***For another hour.*** Finally, one of the men physically dragged him out of the van, slammed the door shut, and leaped back in as they peeled out and roared away - two and a half hours after they arrived.

The cherry on top was a conversation just a few days later, though. One of my dad's friends called him. He lived a few miles up the road from us. He hadn't heard about what had happened, and while he too enjoys long discussions, he had a legitimate appointment he had to get to. However, he mentioned that he had a friend who would love to talk with them. Their faces lit up - they needed a win. He wrote down our address and handed it to the men. Their faces went from joy to stark fear, and they immediately said their goodbyes, fled for their van, and raced away, leaving my dad's friend scratching his head.

As far as I know, the Jehovah's Witnesses have never visited either neighborhood again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/663m6o/turn_about_is_fair_play/,pettyrevenge,186,
2017-04-17 13:51:12+00:00,2770,"Don't pay for a $20 CD, smash your Dad's $250 sunglasses.",lumpthefoff,"This happened in grade 8.  First let me introduce the target; we'll call him Douchebag.  Douchebag was loud and obnoxious and always walked around like he thought he was the sh*t.  I, on the other hand, was more of a wallflower, quiet and reserved.  

My dad loves buying the newest computer gear, and I was the first kid in school to have a CD-writer.  Back then, blank CDs cost $20 and word got out I could burn stuff for people, all they had to do was pay the cost of the CD.  A few of my classmates would come ask me for favors and I thought sure why not.  One day, along comes Douchebag, asks for a game, and I happily oblige.  He says he can't pay until later, and since we're in the same class, where is he going to run away to?  I give him the CD and a week goes by.  He acts like his usual self.  Tired of waiting, I gently asked if he had the money to pay my dad (I wasn't making money, my dad wasn't making money, CDs often failed and that was $20 in the trash each time).  He kept making excuses.  Months passed and eventually I gave up.

Now, in grade 8 we have a school trip to another city for three days before we graduate and go to High School.  While we were riding the overnight bus to our destination, Douchebag was being his usual over-the-top cocky self, except this time he was sporting a pair sunglasses.  He made it loudly and annoyingly known to everyone that he borrowed them from his father and that they were worth $250 and that no one is to touch them.
The trip was to last three days, and on the final day, the school rented out a party room for everyone to have some fun.  For one of the activities, we were divided into groups and given a song to perform for the rest of the class.  I was placed in douchebag's group.

The revenge:

Because the party room had dim lights, there was no need for Douchebag to wear his sunglasses and he left them on the table in front of him.  One group ahead of us went up to perform on stage, and Douchebag was just having the time of his life thumping on the table and hootin' and hollerin', but unbeknownst to him, he had thumped the table so hard the vibrations pushed his sunglasses off the table and under his feet.  I saw it all, but decided to keep quiet.  Douchebag continues to pound the table, and STAMPING HIS FEET.  All the while I was watching him with a smirk on my face.

Then it's our turn to perform.  He gets up to go, but before I join them, I take his seat and also step on his glasses a few times for good measure.  After, we get back to the table, and Douchebag realizes his sunglasses are missing.  He freaks out, starts yelling at everyone angrily, accusing people of stealing his glasses.  I suggest maybe they fell off the table.  He finds them.  Bent and broken.  I'm living my life inside but acting surprised on the outside.  He starts crying, saying how his dad is going to kill him.  His friends are all around him trying to comfort him, saying maybe he can find a repair shop before the trip ends.  

I enjoyed the school trip much more after that. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/65vnla/dont_pay_for_a_20_cd_smash_your_dads_250/,pettyrevenge,104,
2017-04-14 13:36:56+00:00,2470,You only said the collar had to be black.....,secretgirlninja,"Not long after my partner and I moved in together, we got a male chocolate Labrador puppy. It was his first dog and he was crazy excited so I let him choose everything (leash, bed, toys, etc.) and he very specifically chose a black collar because the puppy was going to be a boy. I didn't mind because I knew puppies grow out of collars fast.

Now I love my partner, but he had a very black or white mindset (things are either one way or another, there is no grey area) and our puppy is his absolute baby. 

So a couple of months later our puppy is outgrowing his collar and needs a new one. I talk with my man and tell him how I'd like to get a coloured (blue or green) one. He starts going on about how the puppy is a boy, no colours, next I'll be painting his nails, yada yada, only get a black collar or he won't put it on the dog.

I like to think outside the box, so I came up with my petty revenge. 

I went out and bought a cheap black collar. Then I went to a $2 store and bought a pack of pink fabric roses. I spent an entire day sewing the roses onto the collar. I then hid the old one and hung up the new one with the leash.

Later when he went to walk the puppy, I hear ""What is this??!!!"". I proceed to tell him that he insisted the collar be black, but he never specified anything else and I liked it. He ended up spending weeks getting asked if his precious baby boy was a girl until he agreed that he was unreasonable and would I please take the roses off.

Best part, the next time we got a collar it was blue, and he loved the way it looked against puppy's chocolate fur so much that when we fora harness and new leash they were both blue!!

Edit: TLDR: partner adamantly refused to let me get the boy puppy any other collar than black, so I got a black one and sewed pink roses all over it and refused to remove them until he admitted he was wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/65cjrj/you_only_said_the_collar_had_to_be_black/,pettyrevenge,299,
2017-04-13 12:53:46+00:00,2690,IM NOT ON CALL,fat_cat_guru,"So this just happened. I'm a pharm tech at a well known pharmacy. I have a very full life but make it work with a hectic schedule. My avilabiltiy is 6am to 7pm m-th. I calculated it out and it came to around 53hours of availability during business hours. This is because my mother has copd and I help her with things she can't do for herself. Grocery shopping, laundry and whatever she needs. Everything was fine until we get a new pharmacy manager. He has no idea how to do anything. The team is shocked at what he does. Misses ordering medications we need to fill orders multiple days in a row, jumping ship on the minute when his shift is over even when we are swamped and when it bleeds all the way into the weekend and Monday because we are trying to catch up gets mad. Just not a effective leader. 
Now on to what happened. My friend who was the closer 2pm-10pm took a way better offer with another company and left. No two week notice nothing. Its fine because she was getting crapped on with closing duties and all. I am asked by the pharm manager to work her shifts. Now I have always been a slave to my job in past circumstances but I'm trying to have a work life balance and not burn myself out. I notice after declining that instead of my 32-40 average hours I am only getting 8. Okkkk. Straight up retaliation but you know how retail is and as long as they can cover their butts with a reason I have no action. They say wellll their are no hours which is slightly true. Ok I'll ride it out. Two weeks pass and the hours go back up. Eight hours still. I ask the manager why? ""I only have hours for people who can close"" which is complete bull because everyone else is a student and doesn't close so I'm being punished. That's ok because I'm Scandinavian and can hold a grudge for a looooong time. 

Now for the next puzzle piece, I run a cake business on the side. Its a hobby that I love but I don't push it to make me insane money because it's not what I want my career to be but I can stack up orders if I want. A key team member who is not great calls in last night. It's ok were a good team we can hold it together until our time is up. As more and more people go home the pharmacy falls more and more behind. The pharmacy manager has nowhere to go. He's the only one on duty and now has to fill AND approve because the closing tech has to handle counter and phone. This is where mistakes are made because a pharmacist should not be doing both. 

End of my shift comes and I say seeeee ya and leave. If he had been any other pharmacist I would have stayed and helped until they were less busy but nope you lost my loyalty. They were three hours till close with just the two of them. That brings us to 730 this morning. I get a text from pharmacy manager asking if I can come in for my regular shift I wasn't scheduled for because same co-worker called in again 2nd day in a row. Hellllll noooooo. I'm not on call. You don't schedule me as punishment or to force me into a closing shift availability fuck off. ""No, you caught me on a day I have cake orders due. I'm not on the schedule so I filled my week up with orders"" 

Bit you on the ass didn't it because everyone else is in school...SUFFER

The bartender was in the middle of making a complicated drink, so I stood there and waited until he was done. Meanwhile, an obvious tourist wearing crocs and a fannypack sidles up to the bar and beckons the bartender while he's muddling tarragon and orange zest or something, ""I need a glass of water."" He calmly stated that he will be with her in a minute, to which the response was an exasperated sigh. When he was done, he asked me how he could help (I was there first, after all), which elicited another sigh. I thanked him and headed for the elevators. Just when the doors were closing, a thick hand pried them open and in walks fannypack. Here's the petty part: as I mentioned, this is a nice hotel. So the elevators require your room key card to be scanned each time a floor's button is pressed, but the RFID scanner is only on one side - my side. She pressed 5, but it wouldn't take because she hadn't scanned her room key. She insistently pressed 5, muttering something about the shitty button not working, while I kept silent. The doors opened on my floor and I stepped out, and the last thing I heard was the elevator say, ""going down"" followed by, ""sonofabitch!!!""

(I spent a weekend trying to find 200 yellow notebooks because he insisted that they all be in company colors.) We always struggled to get the slightest headway on anything because he had to create a complicated process to manage the simplest tasks. One of them was our sick line. We were on a deadline to report absenteeism for our region. It's a call center with 3000+ employees all over our state. He insisted in maintaining control over the Google voice account and personally reviewing each message. It took hours.

He announced that he found a new job, and I ended up moving up into his position and he had to train me for a month. One of the first things I did was assign the sick line to a small group of workers who would do the report as they listened to the calls. 

On the night before his first day at his new job, I un-snoozed the calls to the line, so they rang his personal cell phone, as he set it up.

2017-04-10 00:22:13+00:00,2783,I waited two years for this petty revenge and it was AWESOME,Delta_Princess,"Obligatory long time lurker, first time poster. All names have been changed to protect the guilty (and the innocent). Warning: long/text wall.

Backstory: Two years ago, my husband (then boyfriend) and I attended the wedding of two of his friends, Matt and Victoria. There was an open bar, and everyone got merrily drunk. Lucas and I left the reception to go to the house at which we were staying for the night. After we get there, we get a call from Lucas's friend, Kaitlin. She is in tears, and her boyfriend, Brian, can be heard yelling in the background. Kaitlin tearfully accuses Lucas of stealing $4000 out of Brian's car and begs him to return the money. All the while, Brian can be heard in the background, threatening Lucas. Lucas tells her, truthfully, that he stayed with me at the reception the whole time, didn't break into Brian's car, and certainly didn't steal Brian's money. Kaitlin continues that they know he did it, and if he'll just return it, they will let the matter drop. How do they know it was him, you may ask? They found a white pocket knife on the seat of the car, and Lucas is known for always carrying a pocket knife. (He had a blue one that evening to coordinate with my green dress [yes, I picked it].)Lucas hangs up on her and we don't hear from him for the rest of the night.
The next morning, Kaitlin (not Brian) calls and apologizes. They had gotten home and found the money on his dresser. He hadn't even brought it to the wedding and he didn't have the balls to apologize himself. Fine. Whatever. We let the matter drop, but, being a petty and vengeful bitch, I have never forgotten that evening.

So that's our backstory. Fast forward to this year, and Kaitlin and Brian get married in Jamaica (we were invited, but declined) and their stateside wedding reception is this weekend. [As a side note, she included where they were registered on the invitation itself, which I thought was TACKY AF.] Lucas can attend the reception, which is out of town, but I am stuck in our hometown because of work. I am put in charge of purchasing the happy couple a wedding gift. I have been waiting for this moment for two years.

What, you may ask, did I purchase them? That's right, everyone, a WHITE POCKET KNIFE.  But wait! There's more! Included with their gift is a wedding card containing $4000 in monopoly money and signed ""Just in case you lose yours again, here's an extra! Best of luck and all of our love, Lucas and Kimberly"". The best part? Lucas is usually a ""take the high road, Kimberly; don't stoop to their level, Kimberly"" kind of person. He was TOTALLY on board with this whole plan and told me not to even bother getting them anything from their registry (I love that man). 

Y'all, I am NOT expecting a thank you card, but HOLY GOD did that feel good. I have been reveling in this all day. This shit is practically a sport in my family and I think I've won the game this year.

Edit: We invited them to our wedding, in between these incidences, and they rsvp'ed yes. The day before our wedding (after we had given the caterer a final headcount for the plated dinner) they called to say they weren't coming and something had come up. 


Edit: for those of you accusing me of doing this on her wedding day, y'all weren't listening. They got married in Jamaica earlier in the year (January for Christ's sake). Even I'm not THAT much of a bitch. This was their stateside reception. And anyway, who the hell opens their wedding gifts the night of their reception (or wedding for that matter)? 

Edit: Whoops! TL; DR: Assholes make a scene at someone else's wedding and accuse my husband of stealing cash because of a pocket knife. Two years later we gift them a pocket knife and fake money as a present for their reception held months after their actual wedding.

2017-04-06 15:18:21+00:00,2526,"Accuse me of not working my full 40, we'll see about that.",InFiBigDaddy1134,"My job received some dramatic changes with the labor law changes from late last year. While it's not technically law right now, my company is enforcing our policy to test the waters and see how it works for us. Basically this means, I can only work 40 hours a week. No overtime approval is available. Any days we work over 8 hours we have to use compensated time (comp time) to even it out. To help maintain office coverage we have meetings to plan our comp time. 


To clarify, we can only use our comp time only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays since we need a full staff on Monday and Fridays to assist our sales team. Also we can't use it to come in late or leave early. So basically we're left with taking long lunches (2.5-3 hours sometimes) right in the middle of the work day. But randomly, they'll give us full days off when we work 6:30-7 hours on a weekend (which is nice, but this also is creating productivity problems). The staff who are a part of this have grown very frustrated because these long lunches are interfering with our work, meetings, appointments, and for the commuting staff they have to sit in their office for a long period of time and do nothing. Finally after a few months of this ineffective system, we told our CEO that we need to discuss some changes we think would make this better for everyone. He meets with our Exec Team and they agreed to attend our comp meeting to discuss things.


So, this Monday we all walk into the meeting with some level of hope. At the very least we'll be heard and be able to say that we'd like to be able to come in a little late or leave a little early when things are slower. Our CEO explains his view on comp time and then a co-worker of mine explains how it isn't working for us and it's causing problems. Now our CEO is normally a chill guy, but he used an angry and defensive tone I've never seen before and went on a 15 minute rant about comp time. His rant included:

* We're professionals and should act like it...
* But people have mis-used comp time (none of us have ever been disciplined for comp use?).
* We want things to be flexible because we know you work hard...
* But now someone will be planning your comp time for you (what?!).
* Your 8-5 is my time...
* But still extend your lunch hours in the middle of the work day.
* Basically, I want you to think I trust you and that you're professionals, but really I want control over your time instead of letting you figure it out like adults.


After his rant (visibly angry) he looked at me and said I looked like I had something to say. I said his points contradict each other and that I still don't agree with his logic. This triggered one of the other Exec members who went into a screechy rant about how we don't work our full forty hours every week, we're unreliable on the clock (again none of us have ever been disciplined for any of these claims), and that we're wrong and putting this on ourselves. You could've heard a pin drop. The room was red hot at this point. All of us work our 40 (and usually then some off the books because we care about our customers). The CEO said a few words and we disassembled for the day to ""Go home and think about things and we'll discuss them again later.""


I go home and hatch my petty revenge. I worked 6 1/2 hours on Sunday, but they gave me the whole day off on Wednesday. Wednesday morning I wake up, shower, get a nice clean shave, dress in my best suit, and head into the office.


I walk into my office and no one notices right away. I start working, responding to emails, submitting a few projects, the usual. After about thirty minutes our secretary (who controls the comp calendar) rushes to my office and asks what I'm doing here, that I have the whole day off. I just smile a big dumb grin and say, ""Oh, well I only worked 6 1/2 hours on Sunday so I didn't feel like I deserved the whole day. I thought I'd come in for an hour and half to finish some work. Now if you'll excuse me I need to make a phone call."" She stares at me for a second and gives me this look of ""WTF?"" Shortly after I hear whispering across the office and our CEO comes to my office and starts talking about normal work stuff. I smile and agree to do everything he asks, but say I'll likely have to do it tomorrow since I'm only in for an hour and a half today. The guilt of me being there is easily seen across his face. Now our CEO is taking everyone out to lunch later next week (maybe feeling a little bad? Or maybe it's my surprise farewell party?)


Now, the unseen cherry of all this is the Exec Member who had the screechy rant. When my grueling 1.5 hr shift was coming to a close I hear crying coming from her office. Our CEO rushes past my door and into her office where I hear the door close and more whispers. Now I can't be certain it was me (I didn't intend to), but I think my being there was enough to make her realize how rude and unprofessional she had been to everyone in our meeting. Again, not my intention, but if she learned how her poor leadership was affecting her team it was a small bonus. She's lost a lot of respect and I hope she works to gain it back.


At 9:30 AM I smiled and told everyone to have a nice day. As I strolled out I got some thumbs up from other co-workers affected by that meeting. While I know I didn't do much, it was petty, made a point, and felt so good to stand my ground.


TL;DR: Accused of not working my full forty, contradictory comp time messages, so I just showed up for work and was extra kind to everyone for a 1.5 shift I wasn't supposed to work. #killthemwithkindness

 Edit: I did hear a rumor though that our secretary is encouraging our VP to apologize or explain something further with us... progress? Not sure.

Edit: I do want to say, they are good people at their core. Good husbands, wives, etc and I have nothing against any of our superiors on a personal level. I just believe that their management style is bringing down morale and this meeting brought it to an all-time low. Great people, but stupid situation with unresolved conflicts. 

Edit: While none of the current situation is ideal, I want to be fair and say it wasn't always like this (dumb new rules). I do hope things will change eventually and I plan to try and talk with our CEO again once this all calms down.

&gt; I ride a motorcycle in California and lane split, where it is legal (and encouraged by the CHP) to do so. Some jack-ass in a prius saw me filtering up to the front of a red light and pulled all the way over to block me. Mind you, he is like 3 cars from the front anyway, and my filtering has exactly 0 effect upon his commute. Hell, I am actually reducing traffic by not taking up space in line.

&gt; Well, rather than rage out and honk my horn or rev my engine, I just wedged in a car and a half behind him and waited for the light to go green. When the light went green the guy gets back into his lane and starts driving normally. Now, knowing that he is in a prius, I was pretty sure he only checks his mirrors when he is stopped at a light and has nothing better to do. Now was my time to strike. I stayed in position in lane until the next light approached, and this time as I coasted up I held out my left hand and folded his mirror backward as I passed.

&gt; No damage to his vehicle, of course, but he's going to have to stop what he's doing at some point to put his mirror back into position, inconveniencing him roughly about the same amount of time as he inconvenienced me this morning. Worth noting that intentionally blocking a motorcycle in traffic in CA is considered against the law and in some cases can be ruled attempted homicide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/637fv1/guy_tries_to_block_me_in_traffic_gets_mirror/,pettyrevenge,265,

2017-04-02 07:36:33+00:00,2269,Hope you liked getting dragged down stairs,Bigbouncingbob,"I am the supervisor of a very large nightclub and 9 times out of 10 when we preform an eviction it is verbal (easy and no paper work) but every now and then some asshole requests to be physically evicted as a gag to show off to his friends. 

When someone requests to get physically removed from a night club they either try and have a fist fight with us or go completely dead weight, which makes people incredibly difficult to drag/pick up and ultimately remove. 

Anyway, this guy was acting aggressive trying to start fights and as a patron pointed out the male, i saw him and his firends first handedly try and instigate one with a guy sitting down minding his own business. 

I approach him and asked him what the problem was and he replied with ""the guy looked at me funny"". I tell him to ""grow up and it's time to leave"" , his mate yells ""go dead weight haha""

 After 5 minutes of trying to convince him to walk out the door and call it a night he tells us to go fuck ourselves and if we want him out we have to drag him out. 

As I grab his arm and my offsider grabs the other, he drops all of his weight to the floor, we then proceed to drag him, i then see the dance floor to my left so we then decide to go slightly out of our way and drag him through the dance floor (absolutely soaking his clothes in nightclub goodness) we then approach the top of the stairs.. 
This is when he decides to have a change of heart and states ""he will walk the rest of the way"" , which I reply with ""the fuck you will"" and then we proceeded to drag him down the 2 flights of fire exit stairs. 

By the time we completed the eviction he had a lot of bumps and his clothes were completley ruined.

Edit: he was dragged down the stairs by his arms therefore meaning he was pretty much sliding on his back, he didn't get dragged by his legs lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/62ygv4/hope_you_liked_getting_dragged_down_stairs/,pettyrevenge,109,
2017-03-27 15:35:18+00:00,2120,"Now will you take your garbage out to the dumpster, DAWGS?",YourWebcamIsOn,"My first apartment was in the huge complex of townhouse-styled buildings: my doorway faced another apartment doorway, outside (i.e. there was no inside common hallway like in a hotel). We shared a common sidewalk that led up to our doors. I meet Dawg 1 and Dawg 2 the first day there. They were socal surfer brodawgs who called everyone ""dawg"", frequently. It became apparent that these two had the social skills of illiterate 5 year olds. They would throw parties on weeknights, late into the night, blasting music, with the front door open (my bedroom window was right over my doorway). I would dutifully put on underwear and ask them to close the door and lower the music, and they would cheerfully say ""sure, dawg."" Eventually I just went over naked to get compliance.

Our apartment complex was apparently built on a massive anthill. I had sealed off the holes in my apartment to keep the things out, kept the place spotless, trash was always sealed off and taken out, etc, and kept the place ant-free. You can guess what the dawgs apartment looked like. So to keep THEIR ants out, they would just put the trash outside their door. Not take it to the dumpster, just leave it outside for days on end until they decided to stop being lazy. Of course, millions of ants would get into the bags and then where did they go? MY APARTMENT, but of course! I would ask them to take the trash to the dumpster, they'd say ""no problem, dawg!"" but forget to do it. I'd ask again, ""oh, sorry dawg!"" etc.

Finally one morning I reached my last straw. Knowing that these two dicks were sleeping after yet another party, I proceeded to rip open ALL of their garbage bags before I headed to work. These things had set out festering in the socal sun for a week. They were fucking rancid. I spread the trash EVERYWHERE. I covered the entire entrance and made it so that the dawgs couldn't step over it, nor jump over it. When I came home I would just blame the racoon or skunk that we sometimes saw outside.

Came home that day, the walkway is spotless. The guys had just finished sweeping it all up and were actually scrubbing the sidewalk with cleaner and a mop. I was surprised to see they actually had these products, but no, it turns out they stole them from work.
""Dawg, you won't believe it! A racoon got into our trash and went crazy, this place was shithoused! We're not leaving our trash out anymore!""

Good dawgies.

I found a roommate, and we got along fine until he started dating this girl who lived a few floors below us. 

Eventually, she ended up spending every night in our room and moved her toothbrush and towel up to our room as well. It annoyed the shit out of me, but since I was a naive freshman and this was my first time living out of the house I put up with it. 

Finally, one night I asked my roommate if his girlfriend could not spend the night since I had a test the next morning for my 8am class, and I was trying to sleep early. Well at 12:15am she walks in and wakes me up. 

I was furious so the next day I drove to the store and bought a pregnancy test. I took it apart, faked the results to say positive, and left it on his desk in our room. When he got back that night, my roommate freaked out and started calling his girlfriend. I was pretty satisfied about those 20 minutes of sheer terror I cause him.

My job was to clean up tables, set them up, help run food, stock ice, etc.  A server, who we'll call Ashley, was always very over the top about her tables and consistently rude to myself and our coworkers. Like I would clean them off extremely thoroughly and she'd still find something to complain about. One night, I was the only busser on and it was a really busy night. By the end of my shift, the night was winding down and I had a big table to clean up after. Knowing we were understaffed, she still came up to me and complained about ""a spot"" on one of her tables that she thought I had missed. I asked if she could get it since I was busy (and it probably wasnt there) but she said ""Then I'd be doing your job, and I'm not paid to do your job. Once I clean up the floors underneath the big table, I can go home."" and walked away. This was the table I had currently been bussing. Now in retrospect, I'm not exactly proud..... but there was an almost entirely untouched hot fudge sundae on the table. I ""accidentally"" dropped it face down on the floor and it smeered into the carpet, made a huge mess. She had to clean it up for probably half an hour and she had no clue I did it.

2017-03-21 22:41:42+00:00,7115,"No, you don't get to hog an entire table to yourself in a crowded food court.",PlannerDenammer,"I was sitting in a food court quietly eating lunch, minding my own business. This food court is in the CBD and filled with nine-to-fivers. It was crowded so strangers would share tables. There was one sole person sitting at a four-seated table next to me. Every couple of minutes someone would approach that table and ask the table-hog if it was free to sit. He always replied, “Sorry my colleagues will be here soon”. The entire time I was there, no colleagues came and sat with him nor did it appear that he was looking around for them (as most people waiting for others to join will look around and wave them over). He quietly finished up his lunch and left. Seems he just lied to have a four-seater table all to himself when even people on two-seater table were sharing with strangers. Well that's not right!

A couple of days later I saw him in the food court again. I was in a bit of a mood so I bought my lunch and pulled out the chair to sit at his table. As I was sitting down he told me he is waiting for his colleagues. I replied “That’s okay, I’ll move when they arrive. I won’t be long.” He shuffled uncomfortably in his seat as I quietly ate my lunch. I felt very uncomfortable and my heart was racing but I was pissed off at that table hog that I had to do something. If you choose to have your lunch in a busy food court, you don't get to live in your own little bubble.

Edit: I just want to clarify a few things - the strangers sharing tables DO NOT speak to each other beyond ""May I sit here?"". There is no awkward small talk. Everybody eats their own lunch quietly while looking at their phone and make no eye contact.

Also - strangers sharing tables is the custom for this particular food court. I'm sure it would be strange and weird to sit down at a table with a stranger at the food court in your area, however this story wasn't located in the food court at your area. I doubt I would ever find myself in your part of the world and if I did, I would observe the local custom and certainly not sit down at a table with a stranger. 

I neither know nor care if he had social anxiety. By the confident manner in which he denied table access to those several people that he spoke to, I doubt he did.

My dad's a *huge* Volkswagen fan, absolutely loves the things, and at the time of this story (about 1987), he drove a Rabbit that, since he's perpetually broke, was mostly rust and duct tape. He and my mom are going to visit my mom's sister and her first husband, both of whom are fairly well-to-do compared to my parents being dirt-poor rednecks. Dad's brother-in-law had bought a brand-new Audi and my dad parked his rot-rocket next to it. Brother-in-law comes out and starts bragging about his new Audi and while my dad would have shrugged this off, he then goes on to bash Volkswagen in general and my dad's Rabbit in particular, with both of their wives watching.

For those of you who don't know, Volkswagen owns Audi and has owned Audi since the 1960s. Naturally, since brother-in-law is being a dick, my dad asks him, ""Well, if Volkswagens are so terrible, why did you buy one?"" When brother-in-law starts to protest, Dad points to a sticker on the window which had the Volkswagen emblem beside the Audi emblem. He then goes around the car pointing out all the Volkswagen stickers and even pops the hood and starts pointing to all the Volkswagen badges on the various engine components while his brother-in-law gets increasingly flustered again, while both of their wives are watching.

Finally, my dad said something basically to the effect of, ""We both drive Volkswagens, you just paid a lot more for yours than I did.""

I work at a call center with 800 or so employees and a bunch of different departments! We have a lounge and also a lunch room, and the lunch room is where this happens. 

There's a woman that comes into the lunch room every day to Skype with her baby. Only problem is. She talks so freaking loud that I can have my headphones full blast and still hear her. She sings Sesame Street and Elmo songs and it gets annoying after awhile. So, I wasn't in the best mood yesterday because I didn't sleep well. I'm eating my lunch and here comes Miss Elmo's World with her friend. (She is EW)

EW: ""Wanna Skype with my baby?""
*Oh, hell no.*
Friend: ""Aw I love babies sure!""
*Kill me.*
EW: ""OMGEEEEE. HIIIIIIII. ARE YOU WITH DADDY?! AWWW. YOU'RE SO CUTE. AWWWW!""
*I understand it, babies are cute but this is nuts.*
I turn to her and say: ""excuse me? Can you please keep it down a little?""
Elmo's World then retorts: ""haha, no. I'm speaking with my baby. I can be as loud as I want. I'm not hurting anything.""
*So that's how you wanna play? Fine.* 

Now, I am a fan of bands like Linkin Park, Papa Roach and Three Days Grace, so I turned on a song (which was Linkin Park) and cranked it full blast with no headphones in. Elmo's World turns to me and says:
""Turn that off! It's loud and giving me a headache!""
*Oh really?*
I then say: ""Oh, I would, but it can be as loud as I want it to be. It's not hurting anything.""
EW: ""It's hurting me.""
Me: ""You can leave. I politely asked for you to stop screaming at your child who is probably gonna have ear issues by the time he or she turns 10. If it's bothering you, leave.""

She rolled her eyes, walked away and scoffed. I put my headphones back in when she left. That's what you get for being a bitch!

All the interns worked in a shared cubicle space and this one girl, lets call her Jen had a roommate (Tracy) who was super sweet.

At lunch some of us (minus Jen) go out to the park to eat and talk and Tracy shows up and as were eating asks us how we liked the cookies.

Obviously we were confused: what cookies?

Tracy had baked that huge bag of cookies Jen was munching on with the intent that they get distributed through the intern cubicle.
Aw. Hell. Naw.

Rather than confronting Jen about it, for the next two months I came in early every morning and left a big fat Tim Hortons cookie on her desk. On the mornings I couldnt come in, I arranged for a co-worker to do it for me.

Father's a fat priest (this is an orthodox christian country, priests are decked out. BMWs or Mercedes cars, tinted glass, typically lots of cash...), no idea what the mum does, but she's a very unpleasant person to meet, won't even respond to a neighbourly hello, just keeps a scowl on her face 24/7. They have several children, all boys, the oldest being around 16, they all seem to be raised according to their parents' assholeness. I can't speak for the two little twins though, since they don't really know what they're doing is aiding their parents' ultimate goal of being the biggest dick possible.

I was finishing up an assignment and was running just a little bit late for school. I go out, call the elevator which says it's on the 14th floor, one floor above that is. It doesn't move. I take my earbuds out and hear little children's voices- immediately I realize the situation. The mum's not yet out of the flat, but she's sent her two little kids out in advance to call the lift up and keep it there, god forbid she wait a second upon exiting her apartment! You may think I was jumping to a conclusion, but all the noises pointed to it and this wouldn't be the first time it happened. 

This aggression will not stand.

Now, a thought crossed my mind that I should walk up the stairs, toss the kids aside, say ""Sorry, running late!"" enter the lift, close the door and leave. I was even prepared to argue with the missus if I were to come across her too. I don't shy away from conflict. 

But no.

They've pushed my buttons for far too long. It's time I push some buttons myself.

Alright, you goddamn bloody walrus, is that how it's gonna be? You apparently don't mind making people wait when they're already late, you can do some waiting of your own, you scowling, hag.

2017-03-09 18:54:56+00:00,4478,Revenge on a waitress,EvilFireblade,"Not sure if this is the place for it; but I thought I'd share anyway.

I used to deliver pizzas for a great many years, we went to the local TGICHILIBEE's and the entire time we were being served and I was eating I was trying to think of where I knew the damn waitress from. Finally when she brought me the bill, it clicked. I went out to my car and grabbed every piece of change I could find, and with delivering pizzas; it was plentiful. We made a point of hanging around there ordering a few me drinks, decided to have desert, and just generally make hell for this waitress. I know for a good hour I was her last table and she was just waiting on me; which was fine. Once we needed to leave to get to the cinema; taking the kids to the latest Pixar crap, I paid the entire $98.72 bill in change, with zero tip. Spread the change out across the table to resemble a big smiley face. 

As I scooped up my kids to put coats and shit on them, she came over and her face dropped. I simply smiled at her and our family walked out. 

As I was doing up car seats, the manager and the waitress came out and the manager asked what was wrong. I looked the waitress dead in the eye and spouted out her address and that I was simply returning the favor. Manager looked dumfounded, I backed out and left.

This dumb bitch ordered pizza regularly, 4 or 5 times a week, delivered; paid with an obnoxious amount of unrolled change in a Ziploc bag; if I was lucky, and never a tip. Not a single penny. On top of it, she'd frequently call and complain that we'd forgotten something, to the point that her order always showed up in red on the delivery screen to have a manager come visually check that all the items for her order were there before we left.

As a note, I do genuinely tip; always at least $10, regardless of the bill. I couldn't bring myself to tip her. I had to make a point. I simply returned the favor and hopefully taught her a lesson.

I'd told the managers at my store what happened on my next shift and that she'd likely call and complain if I ever delivered to her again, which I knew was inevitable. It was a small family run pizzeria, managers told me I'd be taking the run anyway for a laugh if it came up and it was my turn just to see if she'd call and complain. That's fine, I'd be more than happy to smirk in her face again, even without a tip. Just to have my curiousity fulfilled to see if she learned something.

A few weeks later I managed to, unfortunately, draw the short straw and take her delivery. She just stared at me like an idiot when she opened the door and handed me what she normally does; bitch didn't learn anything. 

I treated her no differently than I would a known $20-tipper at the door, knowing I wasn't going to be getting a fucking thing. She did in fact call the store to complain about fabricated bullshit, and I just laughed. Apparently I called her a bitch, drove through her lawn and hit her mailbox. We all had a good laugh, and she was banned from ordering deliveries after a manager drove past her house to simply make sure I hadn't actually fucked her lawn up and knocked over her mailbox.

If you work for tips, you should definitely tip yourself.

I pull up with loads and loads of wet clothes. Place is empty. So far, so good. 

After I get my stuff in the dryers (I'm using 3-4), a crowd hits. Still not too bad. I should have at least half my stuff out of the dryers before the others need them. 

Then the crazy lady comes in. She gets her laundry into the last of the empty washers. Then she grabs two of the carts (one with each hand) and holds on to them. 

By this time, other washers are finished, I'm emptying the first of my dryers, and people are moving clothes to the dryers. Except some of them have to hand-carry their clothes from washer to dryer because Crazy Lady won't let go of the carts. She glares at anyone who comes close. Everyone in the laundromat is getting a little grumpy and impatient. 

All my dryers finish, except the last dryer of towels. As fast as I'm emptying dryers, other people are taking them. Each time I carry a basket to my car, I pass Crazy Lady. Each time she says, loud and in my general direction, ""You need to hurry up. I need dryers in 5 minutes."" 

Comes down to my last dryer of towels. All the other dryers are full. By this time, Crazy Lady is standing over my dryer with her cart of wet clothes, counting down the minutes left on the timer. I'm staying far, far away while still watching her. 

The dryer clicks off. Now Crazy Lady is practically hopping one one foot, yelling, ""Hurry up! Hurry up! I need that dryer."" 

I slowly walk over. Open the dryer. Plunge my hand deep into the mass of my (perfectly dry) towels. Frown. Close the dryer door. Put another quarter in the slot. 10 more minutes.

The revenge? I just found out from a mutual friend that her fiancé, who I thought was a wonderful guy, is cheating on her. Ordinarily I'd tell her; even an ex doesn't deserve to be cheated on. But a backstabbing thief? Fuck it, she can find out the hard way.

Doing nothing can still be a form of revenge, right?


EDIT: For those mentioning the backlash that this might cause her fiancé, this just occurred to me: the guy is here via DACA from a fairly dangerous country, and I don't know if she could use this against him in any way.

EDIT 2: Since a few people asked, I already confronted her about this. She denied it until I told her about the security photos. Then she immediately confirmed it, but vastly downplayed how much money she took. I told her to stay away from me and my family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5xn6i2/my_ex_broke_into_my_house_so/,pettyrevenge,211,

I get to my pharmacy, pay for my drugs, and I'm told by the tech I need to talk to the pharmacist about the meds. As I turn to step over to the consultation window, a Pharmacy Bitch (PM) rushes over to be first in line. The tech looks over to me and I tell her it's fine, I'll wait. She says it'll be a moment. 

The pharmacist is busy for a couple minutes, grabs my prescription and starts talking to the PM. She says it's not hers and I wave to say it's mine. He moves over to the registers and waves me over.

Let me make your life a little more difficult,Lostsimian,"So I live in a very large metropolitan city, and I try to get out and bike after work and during the weekend. I'm able to get my ride started early enough in the evening, that by the time I am returning home, it's between 5-6pm; aka rush hour traffic. There is this one road I take that connects my neighborhood with the major bike path out of the city. This particular road has a fork that I take to the right. Unfortunately, this direction gets really jammed up at rush hour, so there is this habit that people have to use the bicycle lane as a second lane to snake other drivers on the inside. So tonight, after bobbing and weaving my way through aggressive and annoyed drivers, I found myself between two drivers trying to merge in to the two lane road. To my left, the lady who had patiently waited her turn to merge, and to my right, the leader of the douche-parade. A blacked out Dodge Dart blasting loud music with his windows down, with a vanity license plate that read something akin to ""douche tool"". As I weaseled my way in front of his super sweet 4-cylinder pussy magnet, my bike suddenly had ""issues"", which required me to immediately dismount, and fiddle with my stem. I didn't do it long, because I value my life, but seeing three cars who had waited patiently get the drop on all the cheaters made me feel a little better. When I finally did get back on my bike, I made sure to ride extra slow to keep the parade riding their brakes.

TL;DR use the bike lane to snake traffic, I'll stop my bike infront of you so that people who follow the rules can snake you back ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5x0var/turning_the_bike_lane_into_a_second_car_lane/,pettyrevenge,229,

Even on busy commuter trains people were generally really considerate when they saw me on the crutches. They would offer a seat, make sure I had plenty of space, give me time to get on/off at my own pace etc.

Not everyone though. One day I was getting off a busy train, the passengers about to get on were giving me time to get off. But there was one guy who didn't have the patience and so charged forward to push me out the way. As I half fell to the side I just grabbed his arm to stop him getting on.

He would have a lot of people over every day and they would be SO FUCKING LOUD. it would last until like 3am every night. He even let some guy come over just to let him do his fucking laundry.

Normally the store would close at 10 but because it was a holiday, we were closing at 8 that night and I had a party to get to after work. Like a plague, a huge line of customers forms around 7:50. We were still open for another 10 minutes so we had to take their orders but we kindly let each group know that we were closing at 8 that night. Most people were very understanding and some even ate and left really fast but two groups of people (one wearing obnoxious blinking party hats) seemed to take personal offense to us telling them we were closing at 8 and stayed as long as possible seemingly just to spite us. We kept the doors unlocked so every time new customers came in thinking we were still open we would say we were closed hoping the people still sitting there would get the idea and pack up and head out. Didn't work.

It's now approaching 8:45 and I'm gonna be late to this party regardless so now my mindset shifts from getting people to leave to getting revenge. Five Guys has those fancy, touch screen, coke machines. The nozzles need to be taken out and cleaned and without the nozzle, the water and syrup don't mix well and spray out like a diarrhea storm in every direction and the syrup just globs onto everything. One of the tables had finished their food a while ago and, possibly in an attempt to prolong their stay, kept refilling their drinks every few minutes. I decide it's time to get more of a jump on cleaning so I take the nozzles out of both coke machines knowing what would happen, stand at the counter and wait.

It took all of 2 minutes for some girl to get up and head to one of the machines. When she hit the button the machine just fucking assaulted her with coke syrup while making this loud ass hissing noise that clearly scared the shit out of her. I look over at her and her white shirt is soaked and covered in dark spots. I was just about to walk over to her and explain what had happened and passive aggressively apologize for the ""accident"" so she wouldn't cause a fuss with my boss when I noticed she was walking to the other machine. I stood back and watched as the same fucking thing happened again. At this point, I just walked over and said something along the lines of ""Oh, sorry. These machines do that without the nozzles and we're closed so we're cleaning them now."" I think I handed her like two napkins as if they would help. She and her friends left without an issue a few minutes later which signaled to the other group that it was finally time to leave.

tl;dr Five Guys I worked at closed two hours early on New Years Eve, some guests stayed almost an hour after closing. I took nozzles out of coke machines to ""clean them"", some girl tries refilling her cup at one and then the other and gets coke syrup sprayed on her by both",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5vgikm/make_me_stay_at_work_late_have_fun_spending_your/,pettyrevenge,112,

A woman came into the hairdressers asking for a restyle. She had long hair and wanted it as a bob that was shorter at the back and longer at the front (think ""can i speak to your manager"" style). The hairdresser said this was fine and got the wigs they have to show her how it would look and discussed what length it would be at the front and back and everything was okay.

The hairdresser started cutting and had maybe done half of the back when the customer started cursing and swearing complaining it was too short and in general being a dick. The hairdresser couldn't do anything except apologise for cutting her hair the way the customer wanted it but had to keep going until it was finished since she'd already started.

My hairdressers usually discuss fringes during/after the rest of the hair is cut. When she asked the customer if she'd like it to the side, all the same length, box fringe etc the customer rudely replied with ""it's a fringe just fucking cut it"".

The hairdresser did what she asked and gave her a really short fringe similar to the short one Hayley Williams has. Her manager had also been watching all of this take place so when the customer tried to complain again she finally spoke up and went ""you did tell her to 'just fucking cut it'""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5usq5e/just_fucking_cut_it/,pettyrevenge,96,

I'll make sure you feel just a little bit uncomfortable every time I see you.,--skadi,"There is this girl in my senior thesis proposal class that I will refer to as RB for Rude Bitch. She also happens to be in my anthropological theory class. I had never talked to her before, but assumed she must be nice enough. I was wrong. 

We were put into groups to critique past thesis proposals and I was put into a group with her and another guy. Anytime the guy or I said anything even slightly critical about the piece (we are critiquing!!), she had to say ""well I don't think that's the point"" or ""I don't know if that's what they wanted to do."" She's your typical contrarian that always has to prove you wrong or disagree with you, even about the smallest thing. 

Anyway, we finish discussing the proposals and I start working on something else while the rest of the class finishes up. The guy in my group asks RB a simple question about graduation or something --  very loudly, there's no way she didn't hear him -- and she just straight up blanks him. Doesn't look at him or even acknowledge his existence. 

Initially, I just thought ""Wow, that was incredibly rude."" My petty revenge wouldn't take place until the next day. 

Our anthropology class is designed to have 2 columns of 4 or 5 rows of very long tables with about 5 chairs at each table. RB sits at the same table as me next to the wall and I sit near the aisle. I always arrive to class earlier than her and now every time she arrives and tries to get past me to get to her seat, I don't scoot forward to allow her to pass. I make her squeeze through a small opening between the back of my seat and the table behind me.

2017-02-15 15:00:07+00:00,3296,Rude mother gets owned,Burtonish,"So, up until some years ago, my family and I always used to go skiing at the same place, and we'd all carry walkie talkies on us to quickly let each other know where we were and where we shall meet. Those walkie talkies had a frequency which you could choose at your will (eg my dad once entered another person's frequency and constantly disturbed their conversations by just interrupting them all the time), and of course they were quite loud. 

So on the day where this took place, I drove down all the way to the big ski lift with the gondulas and tried to catch one alone (as I always tried), but of course to no avail, as a woman and her son entered with me. No one talked and the only noise that could be heard was a quiet whistling noise from my phone every 20 seconds or so. To clarify, I was 13, and in hindsight I could see how that was annoying, but try telling this to a 13 year old brat. 

After one or two minutes of this, the mother started loudly talking to her son how rude I was being. Me being a rather unconfrontial kid, I just ignored them which somehow led them to believe that I mustn't speak german (dutch and french people were very common there, and since I'm swiss I understood them). So they gossiped about me, more and more. About one minute before we arrived at the top of the mountain, my mom asked me something (in swiss german, of course), and I took the walkie talkie, looked the mother in the eyes and calmly answered to my mom in swiss german. She went pale and stared at me in disbelief and shame. The doors open, I take my skis and walk away, not before wishing the woman a nice day - in german.

2017-02-08 03:40:24+00:00,2257,Just witnessed some amazing petty revenge done by my 6 y.o son.,ohsheeshyall,"TL;DR at the bottom.

A bit of background: my son (we'll call him Ben) is 6 years old. He's very quiet and polite, but sometimes has trouble sticking up for himself. He takes a bit to warm up to someone, but when he does, he's very sweet. 

Anyway, last month we're on a trip to visit my wife's family on the other side of the Pacific ocean for a family reunion. There, my son meets my wife's 8 y.o nephew, who we'll call Drake. They get along straight away, playing video games and sharing toys and sitting beside each other in the car every where we go. 

However, it doesn't take long before Drake gets comfortable having a little brother around and starts becoming a bit of a brat. He starts ordering Ben around, playing unfairly, talking down to my son and blaming him for every time he's punished by his parents. Now since I'm on vacation, I'm there to see it all, and for the most part my son isn't instigating any of this (I'm not being a biased parent, I swear). 

It broke my heart to watch Ben play games just to lose against Drake (everything was a competition and Drake had to beat Ben or else he'd throw a fit). Regardless, Ben would still look to play with Drake first thing every morning, and would always look to share any gifts he got from relatives or make sure his cousin Drake gets ice cream too when we go out. Be even gave Drake his spare Nintendo DS stylus so they could play Mario Party together (which of course Drake had to win at or else he wouldn't play).

Anyway, 3 weeks of that go by and I've almost had enough by the time we got to the airport to go home. Standing in the check-in line, they were playing tag. Every time Ben was ""it"", Drake would say 'no tag backs' or 'I'm paused' every time Ben would tag Drake. Well, we get checked in and head to the security gate where we say our goodbyes to my brother-in law's-family. After hugs and tears, we start heading into the gate, but my son turns around and sprints after J, tags him in the back and yells out ""You're it!"" before running back to us and through the gate where his cousin would have no chance to tag him back. Separated by the largest ocean in the world, my son definitely got the last laugh and I was the proudest dad that day. 

Edit: Changed the names to Ben (previously B) and Drake (previously J)

TL;DR My son fell victim to ""Little Brother Syndrome"" by his cousin whom we were visiting, but got the last laugh as we were leaving the country. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5sqd9p/just_witnessed_some_amazing_petty_revenge_done_by/,pettyrevenge,93,

They *screamed* at me about part of their order being messed up and it being cold after they'd driven 10 minutes to get home. After verbally degrading me and treating me like less than human, they demanded I replace the order (fine) and give them a free soft serve in a cone for all their trouble (not fine).

I do as he says, but I'm totally pissed about a 30 odd year old man enjoying a power trip over someone half their age when I hadn't been the one who messed up their order and his food wouldn't have been cold if he'd eaten it right away like you're supposed to.

So I replace his food and grab his ice-cream. But when I turn my back to fill up the cone, I crush it ever so slightly so that the bottom part of the cone loses almost all its structural integrity, but it holds its shape. I also choose not to include any napkins in his bag.

I handed him his food and ice-cream and watched as he turned away. He wasn't even out the door before I heard the cone smush fully in his hand and his noise of disgust as he quickly tries to stop the leaking ice-cream getting all over him. But it gets everywhere. As he left, I saw him toss his ice-cream in the bin and shake off the excess ice-cream. Since he thought it was his own fault, he couldn't come back in and whinge at me.

I usually asked my cousin over, because she and I were around the same age and the only person I was really close with.

Things usually went pretty smoothly during the day, but come night time, my sister and her friends would begin pranking us mercilessly. Everything from putting our underwear in the freezer to putting shaving cream on us while we slept to popping out of random places and scaring us. One night, we decided we had enough.

My sister had been warned earlier about the pranking after my cousin and I complained about it. We stayed up late, chugging soda to keep us going until all the older kids had fallen asleep. Then, we pulled out the markers and began drawing all over each others faces. Smears of red and green and purple, we left no areas untouched. We even added little marker streaks to our pillows, to make it look like *somebody's* hand had slipped while they were scribbling on our faces. Then we went peacefully to sleep and waited for the chaos to ensue.

Everything went as planned. Their pranks had been mostly harmless until now, they certainly never did anything that would stain or last more than a couple of hours. My sister and her friends were in deep trouble, and we got off scot free.

For those of you who don't play brass instruments, you almost need a constant supply of water to keep from keeling over especially from two straight hours of playing. 

So this player is absolutely brilliant. For this concert when we first started playing I had only seen him open his music once and then never again. His playing is fucking unreal, and he has never once missed a note or played remotely out of tune. Let's call him Sam. 

So, Sam is the essential god of the trumpet, and everyone, including myself, treats him as a deity. There are just two problems with good 'ole Sam; he's nervous as fuck, and always forgets his water bottle. 

So, we've played this concert about five times, and this is our sixth. Halfway through, Sam plays a beautiful solo which could melt the soul of Satan into a warm puddle, and like clockwork, two measures before he plays, he leans back and steals my buddy Roy's water bottle. This happens literally every concert, and it pisses Roy off because not matter how many times we tell him, he doesn't give it back until the concert is over. An asshole he is.

This sixth concert, we reach the solo, and as usual, Sam leans back, grabs the bottle and takes a big 'ole swig... And chokes. Because that's not water. It's Vodka.

He drops the bottle, rushes to grab mine... More Vodka. Our conductor is looking at Sam, and it's half a measure before he plays. Panicking, he picks up his trumpet... And plays his solo the best of his life. We took him out for drinks afterwords.

He bring two water bottles to concerts now.

TL; DR
Genius trumpet player keeps stealing my buddy's water bottle mid-concert, we give him bottles of Vodka. 

Edit: Changed trombone to trumpet. Didn't realize this when I was writing, sorry for the confusion. I play the trombone, for those who care about details.

As I am surfing around the web in bed I encounter one of those pop-ups that tries to lock out your web browser and have you call a number since ""you have a virus"". Usually, I just open the task manager and close out. Today however, I was bored enough to play along. 

I grab my phone and call the number listed. I then begin speaking to them in the worst, and I mean worst, stereotypical-asian-styled 80's TV accent that I can muster. Since it is so unclear, they have me repeat everything I say 3 or 4 times. When they ask me what website I was on, I tell them I was on Donald Trump's website looking for a way to submit ideas for his wall based on the Great Wall of China. Seriously, I am bored and have nothing to do today until noon. 

This goes on for about 10 minutes, until I just can't hold back my laughter. So then I hang up. They try calling me back multiple times (which is weird because I *67 before I called them). The first 2 times I pick up and go about a minute in character until hanging up. Then 2 more times I just hang up right away. The 5th time I allow it to go to voicemail. They leave me a 3 minute message about how my computer will shut down if I don't call them back. I hope they enjoyed me wasting about 30 minutes of their time with this bullshit.

2017-01-23 16:50:34+00:00,3214,Enjoy wasting 30 minutes of time at my work? Enjoy driving 2 hours to the other side of the city for nothing!,cocometcleo,"So I work in the sales industry, specifically insurance (I know right, my life is exciting).

A gentleman called into the office and was enquiring about taking out a life insurance policy. The call itself was actually great, and he was one of the better people that I had spoken to all day. The conversation was flowing very well and he was just a very friendly guy.

He told me that he was a real estate agent and had been doing so for a few years and started telling me about his family and all that and his office is so close to his home etc. When I was getting to the final part of the sales process, I started asking for his details to which he gave willingly his full name, postal code and telephone number.

After about 30 minutes into the call, and almost to the end of the call he randomly says, 'Hey, before we go any further I've got to tell you something. I don't really want to take out a policy. I just enjoyed wasting your time because all you do is waste every one else's time, go and fuck yourself.' and literally hung up on me.

Now, I'm very good at coping abuse and asshole customers over the phone as it's insurance, but never from someone else in the sales industry who understands what we have to go through. Anyway, I googled his phone number and surprise surprise, the information he gave me was actually legit, it came up with his photo and the real estate agency that he was working for. Because he had given me his postal code I knew whereabouts in the state he lived. I decided to write his number down and postcode and keep it for later on.

Fast forward exactly 2 and a half weeks later and I checked the listings from his agency and which ones were under his name. I found one listing that was a little over 2 hours away from his area. I sent him a text message asking if the listing is still open for inspection as I will be travelling interstate to check it out. He said that the only inspection times will be (last) Friday after 1pm as he had other people checking out the property around then too. I then explained that due to my strict business schedule I would only be able to make a 10am inspection but I expressed my sincere interest in the property. He actually called me and I told him that I was looking at expanding my property portfolio and really persuaded him on my interest in an earlier inspection.

We organised a 10:10am inspection for (last) Friday. Last Thursday evening he sent a confirmation text to make sure I'd be there to which I confirmed.

Now obviously I wasn't going to show up but it was satisfying to know that he woke up earlier, got ready and drove an extra 2 hours to a place where I didn't arrive, and he had to wait another 3 hours until his other inspections arrived!

There'd be no point in driving all the way back to the office to then just drive back for the 1pm inspection so this guy was just stuck there for a while.

I received about 3 missed calls from the guy and then just blocked the number and went onto my day.

You don't look THAT stupid without it.",grantchart,"This happened when I was in junior high school (more than a few years ago).  We put on a musical (South Pacific), and I was stage and props manager.  My mom was super cool and paid for a local place to print up t-shirts with the poster for the play on the front and the names of the cast and crew listed on the back.  All of us crew got one, and we all signed each others' shirts at the cast party.  
  
Among the signatures and encouragements was an anonymous one, much larger than the rest, that read ""/u/grantchart is an ugly pig.""  I didn't notice until the next day, so I spent the entire evening walking around with this hateful thing written on my back.  
  
It didn't take a lot of detective work to track down who had done it.  I was pretty sure right away anyway, and apparently he'd bragged about it to several people.  That, and the fact that *nobody* had said anything really really hurt.  I skipped school a couple of days (it's a girl thing).  But I eventually went back and life proceeded per usual.  
  
Time came for the Spring drama club production, and the asshole scored a major role.  The play was called ""Web of Mystery,"" and his character was a doctor of psychiatry who was the prime suspect for the murders (it would turn out to be someone else, of course).  During the play, he was supposed to hypnotize other characters on several occasions, using a dangling pocket watch as the ""focus.""  I got to be stage and props manager again because I was good at it and loved doing it.  Plus nobody else wanted to.  
  
Opening night came, and he got two surprises:  
First, each of the major actors had little ""bio"" paragraphs next to their roles in the ""playbill"" (the program hand-out for the play).  Everyone else's had things like who they were, their class year, what other productions they'd been in, and so on.  His had all of that, with a small addition that stated ""[asshole's name] is also fond of writing disgusting offensive insults on fellow cast members' crew t-shirts.""  Because, yeah, the stage manager was also in charge of getting those to the printer.  
  
Second, he NEVER got his pocket watch prop.  He was *supposed* to pick it up from a small table just off-stage, but it's hard to do that when the stage manager (i.e. me) doesn't put it there.  So he had to go out in front of the entire audience and hypnotize the other characters with a pocket watch he didn't have.  And he was a bit stupid so he didn't think to change his lines to reflect the fact that there was no watch.  So instead of maybe wriggling his fingers and saying ""focus deeply on my fingers,"" he just stood there and said ""focus deeply on my watch.""  To make things worse, one of the other actors actually said ""what watch?"" as an unintentional ad lib line.  The audience laughed like crazy, and I could see him turn almost purple in embarrassment.  
  
I caught a little crap for it from the drama club teacher the next day, but I explained exactly what I had done and why.  It turned out that he'd written something rude on another girl's t-shirt as well, so the teacher let me off with a wink and a warning about not punishing the audience for an actor's transgressions.  The whole thing was a subject of frantic gossip for a couple of days, and the vast majority of people took my side and thought he was an asshole (it helped that he already had a reputation for being one).  
  
Also, when my mom found out that he'd written something mean on the other girl's shirt she had the t-shirt place print up two more and took them around to all the other kids' homes (except for the asshole's) and got them to sign.  Which is just one of the million reasons my mom was the best mom ever.
  
tl;dr: Jerk wrote something mean on my cast&amp;crew t-shirt.  Jerk failed to understand the power the stage &amp; prop manager have over an actor's success.  I called him out in writing in the next production's playbill hand-out and ""misplaced"" a prop his character needed.  He looked like an idiot on stage, and everybody got to find out what kind of asshole he was.

She was a complete bitch and thought she could get away with anything just because her mum was a teacher. She would throw tantrums if she didn't get her way. Everybody hated her.
It was sports day and I had just taken part in some small sport like throwing a beanbag through a hoop. Boy, was I pooped! So I went to get a drink. 
I'm there waiting in line to get me some sweet, sweet water when the girl stands in line behind me. 
She's telling me how bad I'm doing and generally being bitchy.

The revenge: I get to the front of the line so I pour myself a water. I know this girl is pretty close behind me, so I hatch a plan. As I turn around, I 'pretend' to trip, spilling my water all over her.
She turns bright purple, yelling at me to 'Wait till my mum hears about this?'
Sure enough, her mum comes along to see what the altercation is about. Bratty girl tells her mum that I threw water all over her.
I then explain that it wasn't like that; I just tripped I was sooooo sorry. 
The girl says I'm lying, but her mum says she saw it happen and that it was clearly an accident. She made her daughter apologise to me for getting angry.
I walked away while the girl gave me the evilest eye.

She walks up and *tsks* at me, then proceeding to repeatedly press the lift button. After a long wait, the lift arrives and I being a gentleman let her in first. There is one other person in the lift and more than enough room for me. Anyway, she looks around and says to me ""I'm sorry sweety, why don't you wait for the next lift? I don't think I'll be comfortable with you."" This really got me PO'd. There was enough room for me and another person, but she proceeded to close the door. I then rush down the stairs and press the button for every single floor as I race to beat the lift.  I would wait at the end of each stairwell to hear her groan and mutter. By the third floor, the other occupant walked out and I ran inside the lift. She looked at me in surprise.

2017-01-14 00:37:04+00:00,2187,Stop stealing my sandwiches,SeanPennsFavoriteHat,"About 10 years ago, I was serving in the US Army. My company was in a building that had the offices on the bottom floor, single soldiers barracks on 2 and 3, and the top floor had a sort of locker room/day room where us guys who lived off base could store our stuff, change, take breaks etc.  Right down the street, within walking distance, was a Subway sandwich shop. For lunch I would buy a 12 inch sub, bring it back to the company, eat half, and save the other half for the next day's lunch. We had a communal fridge to store lunches and whatnot. My sandwich halves started disappearing over night. My suspicion was someone who lived in the barracks was coming upstairs after work to raid the fridge. I was infuriated that someone had the audacity to repeatedly filch my daily bread. One day after eating the first half of my sandwich, I had an idea. Now this being the Army there were plenty of guys who chewed tobacco, and some have the nasty habit of leaving their spit bottles laying around. I've seen my share of blood and guts but nothing churns my stomach like dip spit. So I grabbed the nearest bottle and smothered the second half of that sandwich in vomit-inducing tobacco spit like I was the subway guy making a sweet onion chicken teriyaki. I placed it back in the fridge in the usual spot. The next day I came to work and as I suspected, the sandwich was gone. 


I only have my vivid imagination's version of what happened to the thief. I assume halfway through voraciously devouring his plunder he realized the taste was a bit off, and upon closer inspection realized contents of the sandwich weren't limited to juicy chicken and maybe just a little too much teriyaki sauce and proceeded to vomit his entire day's sustinence into the cold porcelain in his bathroom.


 I never found out who it was or heard any stories through the grapevine. I never had true vengeance. I never got to bask in the glory of victory. But not one sandwich was ever stolen from me again",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5nuhdb/stop_stealing_my_sandwiches/,pettyrevenge,125,

Crept my car up just enough so that I could see oncoming traffic and decide if I can make a right turn or not. The traffic isn't bad, a few cars here and there (mostly driving in the left-most lane), and I could make a right turn if I *really* wanted to. Thing is, I don't like taking the chances of making a right turn to the right lane if there are cars whizzing by in the left lane. You never know if they will suddenly merge right in the intersection. 

Guy behind me honks. Now, it's not a short, ""polite"" honk that you do when someone doesn't notice a traffic light turn green. It's a pretty angry 2 second honk. 

Okay, I'll try harder to turn at this red light. Maybe there will be an opening soon. Cars keep coming by in the same fashion, so I'm not making that turn anytime soon. After 10ish seconds, guy behind me honks again, holding the horn even longer. 

Alright. Fuck you too, buddy; I'm just going to stay at this red light until it turns green then. There are probably 3-4 instances where I could have definitely made the turn, guy behind me obviously sees this, and honks a few more times before the light turns green. I take my precious time making a right, and drive slow enough that he's tailgating me, but fast enough that he can't decide if he should pass me or not. 

Stoplight coming up, and it turns yellow when we are still pretty far away. I drive at the same slow-ish speed, but then I speed up at the last second so that I can make the light. Look in my rear-view mirror to see if guy is still tailgating me, and I see that he is now in front of the line waiting at the red light.

**TLDR;** Asshole honks at me, I make him miss the next stoplight. 

EDIT: Okay, didn't think I would trigger so many people with this post, lmao. For all the salty people calling me an asshole for not making the *optional* right turn on red, please [enlighten yourselves](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/do-i-have-to-turn-right-on-a-red/article14475218/).

After her food finished one day I waited a minute for her to come back and decided to add a minute to her cook time.  After that extra minute was finished, The next guy in the microwave line did the same thing.  Then the whole line.  In total, 5 extra minutes.

By the time she got back her micromeal was baked down to a piece of charcoal. (We knew she had more micromeals in the freezer so she would still get lunch).  Her food was utterly ruined.  She looked around for the culprit but we all just ignored her and played ignorant.

Fine, it's what you do for family. He is also recovering from a big break up; they were together seven years, since he was sixteen. So he is now single for pretty much the first time since he hit dating age; he is an almost 24 year old and he is realising the fun of sowing his wild oats. More power to ya. 

Downside.....he is damn lazy. He has always had either a mother or a girlfriend doing everything for him (last partner was very controlling). He doesnt do dishes, clean (except occasionally after his dog) or do laundry.
              
I hate it but also hate having a messy house. So I clean. 

          
Recently though, I noticed some washing which was definitely NOT his in the washing-  dirty one night stand panties. First off, dammit girls, I am not going to shame you for having fun but dont go leaving without anything on your nethers! Turn em inside out if they are dirty, just until you get home to a clean pair. At the very least, we all know you probably wont be back so take your things with you. 

I don't want to be touching these undies; I told my brother as much. He told me he would wash them. I (stupidly) believed him.  After a few days however, I noticed that the undies were sneaking back in to the washing sink(we have washing containers in our rooms which get emptied into a big sink in the laundry where I sort them for washing). 

**Fuck no.**

I realise that my brother knows I cannot abide a messy house and is banking on that I will just keep doing it all for him. He does not realise that washing dirty knickers from his flavour of the night is definitely a chore too far for me. 

So, I sort the clothes and leave the undies in the sink. As they are not his undies, he does not notice that they havent been washed. I put a towel in the sink on top of the undies to hide them from him when he puts his clothes in. Every time some new undies show up in the sink (at quite a fast pace, apparently my brother is blonde girl catnip), the towel gets lifted, the undies drop underneath, the towel goes down. I continue this practice as I bide my time. 

One day, I notice the same girl from the night before. *My petty bitchy sister sense starts tingling.*    
The next night, different girl, but the night after, the previous girl. Holy fuck, three nights is a record for my brother. 

I wake up early (thanks, three year old son) and go to the laundry sink and remove the towel. This exposes easily a dozen pairs of undies. 

I go back upstairs and wait. 

The bitch fit that erupted and caught my brother in its fiery lava of ""What the hell, *brothersname*?"" and ""What am I to you?"" was epic and delicious and I have no regrets. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5kw340/in_which_my_brother_should_have_washed_his_own/,pettyrevenge,193,

I was in the common area for my dorm hall with the RA for the hall and another hall mate (HM). RA was making cinnamon rolls for everyone, and he left the room for a minute. While he was gone, HM grabbed the icing pack to hide as a joke. RA came back in. The following dialogue is an almost verbatim transcript of what was said.


RA: where is the icing?? YOU took it! (pointing at me)

HM: no, I took it, I have it right here (holding it out)

RA: don't try to cover up for fourthtriumvir, I know he took it

ME: he's literally holding it in his hand right now, what are you talking about

RA: I know you actually took it, and you're just trying to frame him. I'm not going to let you have any of my cinnamon rolls, and I'll even give HM an extra one for being honest


A week later, RA called a hall meeting to announce a new policy. Since the end of the year was coming up, they wanted to clean out the fridge. So any food still in the fridge in the two weeks before move out without a name on it would become fair game for anyone to eat. Once solidly within this two week window, I searched the fridge and found RA's last pack of cinnamon rolls without his name written on it. Then I went and asked RA if I could borrow his baking sheet (he was the only one on the hall who had one). I then cooked his cinnamon rolls on his baking sheet. He came into the common area just as I pulled them out.

So this happened last week and just found out today about it fully.  I had last Friday and Monday off due to the holidays and got holiday pay for them which is nice.  Now I took off Thursday because I was traveling and wanted to get some extra time to beat traffic up to Tennessee.  I did this for previous holidays no big deal.  

Payroll came around today and informed me due to a new rule that if you take off the day before a holiday paid day you will not received said pay.  Which means I lose out on 2 days pay that I assumed I would be getting.  Now if I knew this I wouldn't have taken the day off and when I mentioned this she just smirked and said she forgot to tell me when it went into effect but the time was already sent off so oh well.  

This steamed me as I have taken the day off before in the past without it being a big deal and the company is small and she is on the good side with the CEO and complaining wont get anywhere.  I keep to myself at work and have a reputation for being the quiet guy.  So I took some time to plan of some revenge.  Now for context, work is south of Atlanta and everyone lives north of it.  Payroll does as well and she likes to leave a little early to beat traffic home as she is on salary. That takes a 90 minute commute in traffic down to 30 minutes roughly and I do the full commute every day. 

Well, on the first of the week,  they hand out the time sheets and they need those signed and turned back in on the same day so they can submit them before the end of the day.  Usually everyone does this quickly and it is not big deal.  Well I am off at 3 and she leaves at 2:30 to beat the 3 o clock traffic rush.  Today I am really just busy with work and just don't think I can get around to having that signed until 2:59.  She cannot leave until she has turned all of them in and I have to get my supervisors signature on it as well.  That just doesn't look very likely today so guess she will have to stay the full time and not beat traffic.  The first of next week is looking similar as well.

2016-12-25 17:50:56+00:00,4953,Gift giving,Radthrowawaydude,"My aunt's husband is a total fucking dickhead.

For some background, my mother's family is Guyanese and mixed with Scottish, German and Amerindian, but mainly look black. My mother married a white Irish man (my dad) and I came out looking super duper pale with blue eyes and blonde hair. My brothers are both much darker because being biracial means getting a grabbag of genes. 

My aunt (my mother's sister) married a Nigerian immigrant who is lazy and racist. He came over for a PhD course (which he only passed because my aunt wrote his thesis and in the thirty years since has refused to work) and his distaste at being married into the same family as a white guy has manifested in a number of ways, from telling others that my dad has shouted racial abuse at him (witnesses confirmed he absolutely did not) to refusing to even speak to me because of my skin colour. 

A few years ago he was shouting about something completely false and when I told him he was wrong, he tried to physically attack me for being 'disrespectful' and had to be held back by my dad and uncles. He was in his fifties and I was a sixteen year old girl.

I later heard from my grandfather that after he yelled at my aunt's husband, he (aunt's husband) said that if he faced any consequences (like being banned from family dinners or told off again for his treatment of me) he would take my cousins, leave my aunt and go back to Nigeria. 

It's been a few years since then. I'm an adult now, and I've steered clear of as many holidays as possible. I didn't want my grandfather to have to choose between protecting me and seeing my cousins again. My grandfather made it clear he was on my side and would've physically removed the asshole from his home, but, of course, that would result in probably never seeing my cousins again. I didnt want him to make that choice.

My grandfather died this year. It was a pretty awful illness and I spent most of my time out of work inside of the hospital with him. My dad was there too - his father-in-law was the closest he had to a father. My grandfather taught me many things. Including that you shouldn't allow people to ruin things for you. Things like family gatherings.

Now the thing about this dude is, on top of being lazy as shit, he's super entitled. He fully believes that he is head of the family, despite everyone hating him and ignoring him. He believes he is owed deference and respect from all. He told my aunt that since I didn't show him respect, she and my cousins were no longer to buy my xmas presents. I haven't received a single one from them in years. So I set my plan into motion.

I don't get paid a lot, but I saved from October onwards. I filled the tree in my grandfather's old house with presents, one for every person in my family - bar one.

This morning, Christmas Day, I stood under that tree with my gifts in my arms and I gave every person there a present I had spent hours picking out. I went up to each individual, passing him several times while he looked at the gifts greedily, and handed everyone something they would've wanted. I got to drink in the look of guilt on the faces of my cousins and my aunt as I received one solitary present (from my mother's brother) as they received a bunch from me. It was delicious. 

Finally, there was one gift left under the tree - a single envelope. It said 'for all your help looking after grandfather'. I handed it to him. Inside were return Eurostar tickets to Paris for a long weekend. ""Oh!"" I said. ""I've made a mistake! That's my extra present to [Dad]!"" And indeed, there was my father's name on the tickets. He got to see every wonderful gift I got everyone else while he received nothing - nothing from me, nothing from my brothers who hate how he treats me, nothing from my uncles who hate him and only ever gave him things because my grandfather wanted to keep the peace to continue seeing his grandkids. 

The cherry on top? I received a special gift from a friend today. He bought two square feet of land for me and an aristocratic title. I am now a Lady and even though it barely means anything, my family has been pretend bowing and scraping to me while ignoring him and his demands for respect and he's now sulking and refusing to speak to anyone.

2016-12-23 14:51:17+00:00,2234,That mute button doesn't work,baldandoldinIdaho,"This was years ago when I lived and worked in St Louis.   I worked in a call center for a major banks mortgage support group.   It was actually a pretty sweet job,  good benefits,  good pay and mostly good co-workers.  But of course there was always that one guy.

He was a complete jerk both to all of his co-workers and customers.  He was universally hated in the department especially because of his habit of putting his phone on mute and going off on his caller while still on the call with some of the foulest swearing you could imagine (I spent four years in the Marine Corp and even I was impressed and disgusted) and he would do it loud enough that your caller could hear it.   Now this was in the late 1980's so our phones were still just desk top phones with a physical hold button.  

So I have to come in on a Saturday to take care of some paperwork and fortunately the only other person in the department that day was my best friend.   We end up spending some time bitching about this guy while I take care of an annoying hangnail with my swiss army knife. My swiss army knife with a screw driver.   He looks at his phone and says ""you know there's only three screws that hold this phone cover on"".  Our eyes met then dropped to the phone and then to the knife.   Hmm, three screws loosened,  one wire to a certain jerks hold button snipped and off we went to finish our weekend. 

Shit hit the fan Monday morning.   Jerk guess off on a mortgage holder in New York City.   He was in rare form this morning, fouler  than usual.   Five minutes later the exalted VP  shows up with a security guard and unleashs a tirade against this guy that was pretty impressive in its own right (who knew that a Harvard educated, New York native could swear that well).  Well apparently the customer knew somebody that knew somebody and didn't take well to the totally not muted verbal swear fest that jerk had unleashed.   A desk was quickly emptied of personal belongings and jerk was escorted sobbing to the front door by a less than sympathetic VP and security guard.   I felt a momentary twinge of regret that was quickly quelled with a free cup of coffee and danish in the break room.

2016-12-22 17:06:26+00:00,20159,Ex-wife texted me to tell me she had gotten engaged.,mesoziocera,"So Saturday, she texts me to tell me that she had gotten engaged, and felt like I should hear it from her. I was pissed that she decided to tell me this, but I'm moving on. 


Backstory time: After 10 years together, a few of those married, my ex-wife and I separated when I caught her in an affair with one of my friends. After months of gaslighting every time I asked why she was so distant, she started a major fight with me and asked me to leave for a few days, during this time she basically left all but the essentials and moved in with this fat, miserable, vape-enthusiast fuckhelmet. The guy totally spent 9 months spinning lies about me, before she moved in, but she was the one that was willing to believe even the most outlandish things to convince herself that she was justified in cheating. It turns out he was in a better place to financially get her where she wanted to be. This story is long and drawn out, and I won't spend anymore time on it. Just know that this wasn't the first time she fucked me over, but it was definitely the last. Despite pretending they weren't seeing each other and my ex saying that she still wanted to work things out, the separation started last fall, and the divorce finalized in May of this year.




Anyway, her mother called me Tuesday to say Merry Christmas and see how I have been. You could not ask for better in-laws, and I still talk to them occasionally. Anyway, she told me that, despite the engagement, I am still part of the family and welcome anytime. At some point after this, I told her that I wasn't happy about the engagement, but I wasn't surprised, since they had been living together for a year and a half. She got really quiet for a moment, but then wished me a Merry Christmas and told me not to be a stranger and got off the phone.


Yesterday, I get up and one of her cousins has texted me with info on this shitstorm that I started. It turns out that she had adamantly stuck to the story that they had gotten together this spring, and had only moved in together this summer. Her mother went off on her for lying all these months about the cause of our divorce, she's pissed and isn't going to be going to Christmas this year at my ex's new house as a result. I've heard that she was told they would be hosting Christmas at home this year instead.


Now, I didn't intend this revenge, but it did happen. Merry Christmas, bitch.

Update: I'm spending the holidays with the family of my current GF, thanks for the messages and stuff though, and thanks for gold! It definitely helps me feel better about things seeing the positive outpouring over the shit situation I was in.

2016-12-16 16:49:41+00:00,4216,When being the class clown backfires.,jimmypopjr,"I went to a Catholic Military high school back in the late 90's and was a noted class clown. I was known to eschew the dress code and grooming standards with flagrant but petty violations, and just kind of stick it to the military admins who put a lot of stock in following rules and orders. Here's some examples: 

1. Coming in without shoes on - it was always a bet to see if they'd send me home or give me new shoes from the supply closet. They never sent me home, and I think I was given three new pairs of dress shoes in my senior year. 
2. Having facial stubble for uniform inspection in the morning (done by the JROTC students in our class) and getting a fail (have to report to 1st Sergeant for explanation), and then using an electric shaver before reporting to the sergeant. I'd always do this for the inspecting students I really didn't care for, who would get an earful from 1st Sergeant for failing me when I was obviously clean shaven. 
3. Repeatedly calling military personnel by the wrong rank, and sometimes calling the brothers ""monks"" and ""rabbis"". This was great because it'd always result in demerits and I'd regularly get demoted, which leads to: 
4. Constantly stealing ranks and medals from the supply closet (when they'd bring me there to get new shoes). I didn't care about getting demoted because I always had a fresh set of higher ranks to wear. 

I was a solid B and C student for most of my time there, but senior year I was dangerously close to failing Physics (I think - it's been a long time and some of the details are hazy). I wound up passing the REGENTS exam, but the head Brother informed me that for me to get a passing grade for the class I'd need to attend summer school. 

This really sucked because it was our last summer before college, and summer school started promptly at 7am and lasted through late July. But, for the first four days it really didn't seem that bad. Generally it was myself and some fellow underachievers just kinda hanging out for four hours, no focus on academics at all. 

On the last day of the first week the head Brother walks in and says: 

""Mr. Popjr, what are you doing here?"" 

""I was told I needed to be here to pass."" 

He smiled deviously at me and said ""Oh?"" 

Those fuckers had pranked me back and had me attend a week of summer school when I didn't need to. I had passed the class, but grades hadn't been mailed out yet, so I had no idea. 

I wasn't even mad - it was pretty awesome of them to get the last petty jab in before I'd leave the school for good. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5ip9oa/when_being_the_class_clown_backfires/,pettyrevenge,88,

So the place I worked at was pretty nice by normal standards, but for my area it was basically one of about 3 nice places to sit down and eat in a 30 mile radius.  HAd a guy come in shortly after open one day, said he wanted to reserve a table for that night and wanted to know if we could ""make it special""

He had flowers he'd purchased, and he asked if we could bring them out during the meal.  I said it was no problem, and even let him fridge the flowers in back so they'd be nice and fresh for that evening.  He also wanted a ""secluded"" table, I looked at the reservations and he was the only one, so reserved about 6 tables around the fireplace for him, and told the other servers to only use those tables if we got busy.  This was all in front of him, I felt like we were sort of helping him plan, it was fun, and you don't get a lot of chances to do something nice and rewarding waiting tables so we were all on board to make it an awesome night.  When they arrive I've got the table done up with candles and we ended up being really slow so I was able to give them the entire fireplace room to themselves, and put everyone else in the main dining room.

The dinner went off without a hitch, I gave them a free wine tasting, free dessert, brought the flowers out, the whole bit.  The guy's date was positively beaming.  I felt great, and the rest of the staff just thought it was a really neat little evening we'd thrown together for these folks.

I saw them get up to leave, and grabbed the little black book we'd put folk's bill in to see if I'd gotten a nice tip or even a nice little thank you or something.   So naive!

There was their ticket, and the tip line had a big fat line drawn through it.  This was 100+ dollar meal.  I'd been stiffed plenty of times, usually you just shrug it off and on to the next, but the fact that this guy had asked for service above and beyond made me see red, before I could even think about it, I was fast walking up to the happy couple, I caught them right at the front door.

""Was everything all right with your service today?' I heard myself asking.

The lady starts to beam, ""It was SO wonderful thank you SO much!""


Dude gives me the look.  That look of, ""Oh shit, don't fucking bust me out dude.""  The panic in his eyes seals his fate.

""Are you sure about that?"" I ask, and flip the bill book open, and point at the tip line.

The lady gasps, ""You didn't tip him?!""

""I uh....forgot....I have money in my car""

She looks at him incredulously.  He ""runs out to his car"" and grabs me a wadded up five, that almost certainly came from his pocket, not the car.  Put it in my hand while giving me a death stare, and they walk out awkwardly.

What does it include?,iwouldlikethings,"At the beginning of September I and 5 other friends moved into a student house, the house underwent a lot of work over the summer and for some reason, they decided we didn't need desks or chairs anymore.

Naturally we were surpised that they didn't provide us with these as were students, so we went to the letting agents to see if we were going to be getting them. The letting agents threw the contract at us saying ""It's not in the contract so you won't be getting them"", we were annoyed but it wasn't too much much of a problem as half of us had our own we could bring and the others just went to IKEA to get some cheap ones with the money we got back on rent as the house wasn't ready until two weeks later than we were told.

If we had have been given the desks and chairs we wouldn't have looked at the contract, but as we were annoyed we took a look and what do we find? A dishwasher and a tumble dryer! I've always wanted a dishwasher. There is nowhere that this dishwasher easily can go, and so the petttiness begins. 

Back onto the phone to the letting agents to inform them that the dishwasher and tumble dryer which are in our contract aren't in the house. They say they'll speak to the landlord and let us know, they come back almost instantly saying the landlord is willing to compromise and buy us desks and chairs for the rooms, the tumble dyrer, but not the dishwasher. We're having none of it, we're getting that dishwasher. 

Several phone calls later and they finally agree we are getting one, the order has been placed and it will be arriving in a few days. Brilliant, they had to plumb it through the downstairs toilet in the conservatory/outhouse place (which is next to the kitchen), drilling two holes through the wall into the conservatory as they even managed to do that wrong.

So there is was, our dishwasher. And the best part, we've only ever used it once in the last three months.

He then zipped back into the far right lane, cutting off a small bus for a local preschool next to me, who also has to slam on the brakes.

This happened last week. I had just got out of class, and the professor had insisted to make us stay for the 15 extra minutes he needed to complete the discussion of the topic of the day. I live relatively far from my university and I need an hour and something for commuting. I had an appointment after class and was running late for it since the professor had made us stay, so I was walking pretty fast on the sidewalk, dribbling any people in front of me when I could, in order to get to the station on time for my train. The sidewalk was quite small, with a width that was barely enough for two people, and had a fence on the side facing the road, so i couldn't step off the sidewalk, surpass the people in front of me and then step on the sidewalk again. Since it's this small, it is commonly accepted to walk one behind the other and leave space for people walking in the opposite direction and/or for people (like me) who are walking faster than you.

At one point I reached a group of four girls. They were occupying the whole sidewalk and walking really slowing, ignoring everyone around them. All of them were also smoking cigarettes. I approached them from behind and politely asked ""excuse me, could you move a bit and let me pass?"". I got no reply. I tried asking again, but again no reply. They did notice me tho, because they kept looking back to check if someone was behind them and ""accidentally"" exhaled their cigarette smoke in my face. Note that while I have nothing against people who smoke, I absolutely hate people who smoke in my face because I start coughing really violently, I just can't stand cigarette smoke. Anyway, they showed no sign of letting me pass. I was pretty much furious at that point, because I was gonna be late because of them. Being really close to them, I could hear them talking between each other. They had a train to catch but were quite early for it, so instead of taking a bus to the station they decided to go there by walking. Except they didn't know the course... so they had the courage to ask me, the person closest to them, who had repeatedly asked them to let me pass, how to get to the station. This is where my petty revenge kicks in. I know that the station was a 10 minute walk from there (in fact, the station was my destination): you just need to turn left, cross the road and you'll find the station right in front of you. Instead, I told them to turn right and walk for about 10 minutes, then turn left on a certain street and after another 10 minutes they would get there. They didn't even thank me (figured as much), and happily followed my instructions by turning right.

I hope you were late for your train, assholes.

2016-11-27 19:58:46+00:00,2987,"Theft and coupon fraud, I will slay you with fake kindness and throw away your coupons.",ScorpioSpork,"This happened a couple weeks ago. I work in a large store in the toys and electronics department. I was set to close in that department, but the store was extra busy due to some early holiday sales. I got called up to backup the registers as a spare cashier, just to shorten the lines and check out 3 or 4 folks.

I hop on a register and call over the next person waiting in line at another overflowing register. But before that person can move over, another woman pushes past her, pretending not to have seen or heard what was going on. I'm going to refer to her as Bad Mom. She's pulling two overflowing baskets, has a baby covered in vomit in one arm and a toddler running behind, trying to keep up.

I overlook Bad Mom cutting in line, knowing she would only slow down another register anyway, and none of the other customers complained or looked annoyed. This poor mom definitely had her hands full, or at least that's the image she was going for.

I greet Bad Mom, do my friendly bit as I start scanning her items. She is flustered and rushed, but is overly friendly. She starts strategically placing the toys on the counter to check out in a specific order.

""Oh! The friendliest employee was helping me out in toys earlier. She said to double check all of the prices for these toys, because they're not ringing up for the correct amount,"" explains Bad Mom.

Alright, sometimes old signs are left up, and we have to honor them. I'm trying to move quickly, so I listen to her as I ring up the items. I would have ignored one red flag, and corrected one item no problem. The store was incredibly busy, and sometimes it's easier to chop off $3 off their bill and look into it later.

But this wasn't the case. Bad Mom had corrections on almost every toy, $10-$20 off each item with the rare ""Oh that one is correct"" to balance her story out. So I start asking innocent questions in a very friendly fashion to lure out more details.

""Oh wow, these prices seem really off!"" I say in a surprised, apologetic voice.

""Yes, I know! The girl working back in toys was so very helpful.""

""I'm so glad to hear that! Do you remember who it was? It helps them a lot to get good compliments from customers.""

Bad Mom happily weaves a lovely detailed story for me about a non-existent employee. One, I was the only person working in that department. Two, I was the only female employee anywhere near that section of the store that night. Three, Bad Mom describe this girl as being blonde. There was literally no blonde females working in the store that day, and absolutely no blonde female employees in that department or the surrounding departments.

Out of the corner of my eye, I see a manager walking past. I flag her down in front of Bad Mom.

I keep my voice very sweet and happy. I speak clearly and loudly so the customer can hear. ""Hey, [managers name]! This guest had an awesome compliment about a blonde employee working toys tonight, but we can't figure out who it is. I'm the only one working in toys tonight, correct?"" 

I see Bad Mom get a little nervous hearing that I work in toys.

The manager is very obviously confused, ""Uh, yes, you're the only one in toys..."" She speaks politely, but I can see her looking over the customer and her overflowing carts. ""Is something wrong?""

I sweetly explain that I'm having to do some price adjustments and just wanted to double check with her and whoever else was working in toys. As I say this, an idea pops into my head.

""Oh! Was it [employee]?"" I point over to another employee, who's head is barely visible through the crowd. You can just barely see the top of her head, which has two bleached streaks of hair. I secretly hope Bad Mom takes the bait.

""That could be... Yes, I think that was her!"" Bad Mom exclaims, her voice overflowing with happiness and relief at being given an out.

Little did she know, I had pointed to a woman who works in Asset Protection (AP). The manager picks up on it right away and says, ""Oh perfect, I'll send her over. Take care of the other cart until then.""

I become increasingly apologetic about the hassle, saying that I really didn't mean to make a big deal about it and promising to hurry with her groceries in the mean time. Bad Mom keeps her act going, her voice dripping with fake friendliness, meeting each of my apologies with her own for being so much trouble.

As I start scanning her groceries, she pulls out more than 30 pages of printed coupons and scatters them across my entire check lane. She turns up her flustered act, waving her children around for pity. Her baby boy, his face and entire front half of his body covered in dry vomit, looks exhausted. At this point Bad Mom is literally slinging him around in her arms, jostling him, keeping him from sleeping. Her toddler is laying on the floor crying quietly and unable to articulate completely that she is hungry. Bad Mom keeps apologizing to her toddler without even so much as glancing at her, promising to get her home soon.

Bad Mom keeps going with her story, saying she had been in our store shopping for over four hours (which I later learned was very false thanks to the cameras). I offered having her carts ready for her if she wanted to get some food for her kids or take them to the restroom. She declined, saying it wasn't a big deal.

By this point, Asset Protection has arrived. I prompt Bad Mom to explain the details to AP, who is very friendly in return and offers to have all of the prices checked for her, but warns it will take time. Bad Mom disengages as much as possible. She can tell her story is now very obviously false to us, and says she would love to come back later tonight to purchase the toys. Bad Mom diffuses as much as possible, clearly hoping AP will go away.

AP stays nearby, of course.

Bad Mom starts passive aggressively rushing me. She dials up the friendly act even further, responding to anything her toddler says with, ""I'm sorry, honey, this is the last time mommy will use so many coupons. I promise we'll go home soon."" Bad Mom intentionally brings up her children to me as much as possible, trying to invoke more pity and hoping I will mess up the coupons. She starts actively trying to trick me into scanning extra coupons or scanning them twice. She tries to separate out her orders to use conflicting offers.

Sadly, I'm not new to this game. I don't fall into the rushed emotional state she's trying to put me in. I scan each item and coupon correctly, and gently explain each time I can't accept a coupon. I work quickly for the sake of her children, but Bad Mom is wasting time mixing up the coupons intentionally, literally shuffling them when she thinks I'm not paying attention.

My visual memory is very good; I know when I've scanned a coupon. Bad Mom can't trick me, and even when she thinks she does, I intentionally scan a coupon double to show her the error that pops up on the register. After 10 minutes of coupon scanning and item counting, I begin to lose my patience. So I turn it into a game for myself. How many pages of her precious coupons can I throw away?

See normally, we are supposed to throw away coupons when we scan them, but because she had them all printed out together on pages (6 or so per page), she wouldn't let me take them. I began exclaiming things like, ""Awesome! I got all the ones on this page,"" and ""Perfect, you've claimed all of these already"" and throwing away full pages of coupons. After throwing away 5 or 6 pages, which was sadly only a small dent in her stack, she began clutching each page to her quickly after I exclaimed that I was done with a page. 

So I lean back comfortably, take a short step away from the counter each time I pick up a new page to scan. I keep up my friendly chatter and toss each page after I've redeemed the coupons on it. I keep saying little victory phrases after each page, as if I was on her side. I do return a few pages to her to keep the illusion going, but only if more than half of the coupons on the page weren't redeemed or duplicates.

Bad Mom must have admitted defeat after that. She dropped the butt-kissing attitude and didn't shuffle the coupons after that. She even sifted through the cart of toys and paid full price for two of them with the excuse of: ""I remember the price of these were correct, so I'll pick them up now.""

I apologized for the inconvenience (of not letting her get away with lying or coupon fraud) and gave her oldest child a sticker for being so patient. The poor girl had given up on crying and had spent the last half hour sitting on the floor fidgeting with some M&amp;Ms that Bad Mom bought for her quite angrily.

After Bad Mom left, I checked in with AP. Turns out she had been watching her since she first walked into the store since she was a known shop lifter. She hadn't been in the store long, grabbed toys quickly off the shelf without even looking at prices, and of course, there was no mysterious blonde employee. Bad Mom was very lucky that she didn't try to steal anything that day. This just gets added to her file, and she'll be watched even more closely at the registers now.

**tl;dr** A mother tries to get $200+ worth of toys for under $50, feeds me lies to do so and neglects her tired, hungry kids in the process. She then wastes my time and delays her kids from eating even more by trying to commit coupon fraud. I unnecessarily toss most of her coupons and add to her record with AP.

I'm long-winded, sorry. D:",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5f75tb/theft_and_coupon_fraud_i_will_slay_you_with_fake/,pettyrevenge,294,
2016-11-25 03:35:21+00:00,11568,"Tailgate and honk on a single lane street, how'd that work out for you?",Maar7en,"This happened a few months ago as I was driving my work van(the biggest Mercedes sprinter you can drive without a commercial licence) around Amsterdam delivering groceries. This story takes place on a single lane road with high curbs on both sides that takes you from one neighborhood to another. Speed limit is 50kph, although it could have been 70 imho except in some tight corners.

Now I've driven here so many times before that I feel comfortable doing 60-ish, just a bit faster than normal without the risk of getting caught speeding in an urban area. 

Suddenly I hear a loud beep behind me, and wouldn't you know it, it's a BMW! ""What a surprise!"" I think to myself. I was quite impressed by my ability to guess the brand of this automobile, because everything forward of the rear doors wasn't visible in my mirrors. 

The tailgating and honking continues for a little while until I spot the perfect opportunity to teach this Ikea-pencil equipped douche a lesson: a long straight section in the road. For those of you who haven't been to the Netherlands before, our government loves two things: taxes and using those taxes to build speedbumps. 

As such we have a wide variety of speedbumps and this straight section was equipped with my personal favorite: the bus bypass variant, a trapezoid block just wide enough that a normal car has to pass over it with at least one wheel, but a bus can pass over it unobstructed.

I've had plenty of practice with these obstacles and line up for a flawless pass while accelerating to a mindnumbing 70 kmh, the BMW still glued to my rear bumper. I pass over the obstacle without the slightest inconvenience..... The oblivious BMW driver however hits it in the worst possible way, launching himself into the ceiling of his car and grinding his oilpan as the suspension compresses.

After that he kept a good distance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5erj5l/tailgate_and_honk_on_a_single_lane_street_howd/,pettyrevenge,561,

They agreed enthusiastically. For two weeks now I've been cutting the coffee with de-caff,slowly reducing their caffeine dosage until they unknowingly had a collective low tolerance.

I worked next to the office that dealt with ID card issues.  When they would get overloaded I would sometimes slip over to help them.

One day I go over to see if I can help.  I saw on the sign in sheet they had been consistently skipping one particular name.  There could have been a perfectly good reason why, so I asked.  The general consensus was they didn't have time to ""deal with an old drunk.""  I look over at the guy.  Now this guy had red eyes, red nose, was shaking like a leaf and was quietly muttering to himself in confusion.  He was easily well into his 70s and looked like he had slept in his clothes for days.

I approached the man.  I noticed straight off he didn't smell of alcohol.  I took him back to my cubicle because the waiting room was so loud I couldn't hear him.  Turns out his wife had died the previous night.  He had spent the last week in a hospital by her side.  He knew he had to turn in her ID card and deal with the military paperwork involved.  He was just... lost.

One of the ID card airmen came in to tell me in front of this veteran that I HAD to come help them and to stop wasting my time with ""this guy"".  The airman's main concern being the line was backing up and it was almost lunch time.  The veteran actually stood up and started apologizing to this POS airman!

I sat the veteran back down.  I explained thoroughly he was my top priority.  I told the airman I was already handling one of HIS customers.  I then called the Casualty Office to let them know to get the paperwork together, told them not to rush.  The airman was mad but could do nothing so went back to his ever growing line of customers.  In the meantime, I let the veteran do what veterans do best - tell me old stories.  A good hour later the Casualty Office came by to assist and to bring him to their office.

The veteran hugged me quietly as I got up to go to lunch.  It made my day as I sailed through the ID section's packed waiting room knowing they wouldn't be getting lunch that day.

So this place was a great Chinese restaurant with all the traditional dishes and such. But the thing about it was that only locals really ate there. And when they did, it was regularly and pretty consistent.
As time passes, I'm sitting there fiddling with chopsticks and waiting for food. Then, the door opens with an electronic ringing tone. A man (We'll call him Robber Guy, or RG for short) walks in with what looks to be his friend. He sits down at a two person table and opens up the menu.
Now what I didn't know then was that RG has been here about 3 times, and at the end of his meal he would get the check, say ""Oh, I have no money,"" and fucking scamper out of there with a smirk. The owners of the restaurant were really nice people, so they let it slide for those few times because they didn't lose too much money. But this time they had enough, and so did the locals who were there.
(Back to the present time)
As RG was talking with his friend, the local customers around him started saying things like: 

""Oh, you have never been here EVER before? Well, the food is amazing!""  
""There was a guy here before that didn't pay at all, what a shame!""

All while just staring right into his eyes. Every word only made RG's face redder and redder. He seemed to sink into worn hoodie while his friend sat confused without knowing what was really going on. This repeated for a while until the owner finally asked RG if he had money this time. After that, RG's face went completely pale and then he stood up abruptly, pushed in his chair, and ran straight through the door with his friend tagging along.

2016-11-15 00:21:10+00:00,7348,The twice-stolen pen,valiantfreak,"Dad is a principal at a school, and has been for a long time.

It's a relatively small government high school of about 300 students so anyone wanting to enroll has a pretty good chance of actually speaking to the principal instead of one of the admin staff.

One day some lady arrives and expresses an interest in enrolling her son. Principal Dad is speaking with her, gets her some forms to fill out, even offers her his special pen. The pen is a nice stainless steel job that was given to every member of the executive staff on the school's 25th anniversary. It even says ""[school name] Celebrating 25 years 1978-2003"" on the side.

Anyway, lady and her son fill out the paperwork and go on their way, at which point Dad realises his pen has also left. Clearly the pen wasn't a gift; it was obviously more expensive than a plastic hotel pen.

Fast forward to the next week when the lady arrives to drop her son off for his first day at the school. Principal Dad waits for Mrs Pen Thief and gives her the Emergency Contact Form to fill out. Normally this is given to the kid to fill out but Dad was hoping to see the pen again. 

Sure enough, this silly lady forgets where she stole the pen from and out comes the 25th Anniversary Pen to fill out the form. The form completed, she puts the pen back in her handbag and hands the form back.

""And now I just need to sign it here"" says Principal Dad, patting down his pockets as if looking for a pen. Instinctively Mrs Pen Thief reaches into her handbag and offers him The Pen. 
""Thanks"" he said as he signs on the bottom of the form (which was just a ruse, he didn't need to sign anything) and puts the pen back in his own shirt pocket right in front of her.

Mrs Pen Thief looks confused, opens her mouth, realises what has happened, and quickly closes her mouth again. She mumbles a thanks and scurries out the door.

Last Friday, I was running on empty after 55+ hour week and enough caffeine to kill a small child, and was about to go home for the weekend. As I grab my things, my older coworker runs up to me frantically asking if I can help her with her excel spreadsheet because she has a report due **TODAY** and she doesn't know how to do what needs to be done. Me being the nice guy that I am, I walk back and sit down with her. 

About an hour and a half later, what had started as me showing her how to do things had ended with me finishing her spreadsheet for her. I save the file and tell her she can run the report and turn it in. 

""Oh, Jesze_, this report isn't due for two weeks. Thanks for staying late today so I can turn it in early and look like a great employee even though I'm not at all!"" I might've paraphrased a bit but that's beside the point. 

After she left, I got a fantastic idea to be petty. This particular coworker is the one in the office that claims one of the tables in the lunch room as her own, and she does needlessly large puzzles on them. I'm talking 1000+ pieces. On my way out of the building, I stopped by her table and took a puzzle piece that goes right in the middle of one of her puzzles. Today, exactly one week later, I walk into the lunch room and see her tearing the place apart looking for this puzzle piece. It's currently sitting on top of some old food in my trash can at home.

So this 24 year old looking lady comes in and I ask her for her ID. She immediately goes on a tirade of ""do you know how old I am?!"" I explain that it doesn't matter and I have to check everyone's ID as that's our policy (along with the policy of almost every other bar in town.) so all her friends give me their IDs without any issue. Finally the angry one gets her ID out and touches it to my face and says ""see I'm fucking 30! And it's my birthday today!"" So I politely respond with ""that's nice. Maybe you should act like it."" And she loses her shit telling me how much of a dick I am. And I told her she didn't need to come into the bar if she didn't want to. And she told me she'd be where ever she wanted to be. And this is where she is drinking. 
So she goes to the bar and I tell all the bartenders to make her wait as long as possible before serving her and then to only serve her once and cut her off.

""I'm sorry mam we are going to have to stop serving you. You appear to be to drunk."" She freaks out and tells her friends they are leaving the bar.

2016-11-07 21:19:11+00:00,3104,You picked the wrong seat to be rude.,weazalbee,"This morning I hopped on my train toward the city as I normally do for work. It seemed like it was going to be a decent day, it wasn't too cold out, I felt strangely energized (despite it being a Monday), and I was ready to be productive. I live pretty far up on the train line, so I generally don't have trouble finding a seat in the morning. I plopped down and started to wait for my stop to come.

Fast forward two stops: an average looking man takes the seat next to me. Now there's plenty of space on the train to sit, but I suppose the seat next to me was most convenient to him. I didn't really mind as he seemed to be tired and looked like he wanted to keep to himself.

Oh how wrong I was.

This kind fellow decided that his large backpack was too good for the floor and decided to put it in his lap- this wouldn't be a problem if he kept it to himself. Instead, the man chose to allow his bag to enter my space and rest partially on my leg. I tried being reasonable and asked him to move it. He just stared at me and clutched his bag as it was, moving his arms so that his elbows were now digging into my arm. To make matters worse, he decided he'd get comfy and started to spread out. He kicked my foot over and just decided to let his leg be all up in my space while he proceeded to try and take up two spaces on the train.

By the time he was settled as a thorn in my side, the train had filled up and there weren't any seats I could move to. I still had another 25 minutes to ride and didn't particularly want to stand because of this man so I decided to take matters into my own hands. 

As many of you know, trains generally come to quick stops that jerk you around a little bit. Most people generally try to stay steady as to not disturb other passengers. I decided to forego this courtesy. Every time the train came to a stop I would leave my motion unrestriced and slam into this man. Every. Single. Time. The first couple of times it happened the man just glared at me. I responded in the only was I could- I shrugged. After a few stops of being pushed into the wall the man decided enough was enough and got up. He stood the rest of the way to my stop as the train filled with more people. I can't imagine he was too fond of having that many people in his personal space, but I guess he had it coming.

2016-11-05 20:23:34+00:00,5224,"Ladies get mad at me for moving my canopy so I'll be in the shade, I pretend I can't understand them.",Azzizzi,"A few years ago, when my wife and I were still dating, we went to one of my son's little league baseball games.  We knew in advance which baseball field it would be played in, so we already knew they had no seating for spectators and no shade, either.  I brought lawn chairs and an EZ-Up (a canvas canopy with four legs).  

When the game was about to start, we picked out a spot down the first base line where we could set up our chairs and the EZ-Up.  Several parents were already there to watch their own kids play.  Like us, most of them brought their own chairs.  

I figured I’d start with the EZ-Up, then I’d go back to the car to get the chairs.  Among the parents who were watching the game, there were two ladies (who I assume were Vietnamese) that were paying particular attention to me as I put up the EZ-Up.  They were about 20 feet away from where I was putting the canopy up, but they kept turning around and looking at me, talking about what I was doing, and pointing at me.  I got the impression that they had a problem with what I was doing, but I’d seen people with canopies at the games before, and I’d set up behind everyone, so I didn’t see what the problem was.  

When I’d finished putting up the canopy, I asked my wife (girlfriend at the time) to stay with the canopy while I went back to the car to get the chairs.  The car wasn’t parked very far away.  When I got the chairs from the car and headed back to the canopy, the two ladies had gotten up and were moving their chairs to be  under the shade of my canopy.  

This was in the afternoon, so the shade provided by the canopy was already several feet away from being directly under the canopy.  Instead of being under the canopy, the shade was a few feet to the right of the canopy, leaving the underneath side of the canopy directly in the sun.  

These ladies set their chairs down right in the middle of the shade of my canopy and were sitting there talking to each other in what I could only guess was Vietnamese.  It might have been Thai or Laotian or something else, but whatever it was, they were talking to one another and seemed to be very happy with themselves for beating me to the shade provided by my own canopy.  

I unfolded the chairs beneath the canopy and asked my wife, “How’s that?”  

My wife sat down in the chair and said, “Good, but we’re still in the sun.”  

“No problem,” I said.  There was no one to the left of us, so I picked up the canopy by one of the legs and dragged it across the ground to the left until the shade was covering our chairs.  

As I did this, the two Asian ladies, looked up and around, like they’re trying to figure out why their shade was disappearing, as if it wasn’t completely obvious that I was moving my own canopy so I could sit under the shade I had intended to provide for myself and my wife.  

I’d already been married for nine years to a really shitty person, so I had a lot of practice in dealing with selfish people who thought of only themselves.  I wasn’t about to sit there and just suffer in the sun when I’d been the one to bring the canopy for myself and for my wife.  

These ladies were mad, though.  I don’t know what they were thinking, but they had the impression that they were entitled to the shade from my canopy because they had sat down there first.  

“You put that back!”  One of them said.  She had a really thick accent.  “You can’t move that!”  

“I what now?”  I asked.  I couldn’t believe it.  

“You took the shade.  We were sitting here and you took it!”  The other one said.  

I was in disbelief that the two women would both come to the same conclusion.  I wondered if it was some kind of cultural thing, like maybe where they were from, it was bad manners to provide something and then take it away or maybe if they had gotten there first, they thought they were entitled to it.  I didn’t know and didn’t care.  

Those two then turned to each other and were squawking back and forth in whatever language they both spoke.  Then, turned back to me.

“You put it back!”  One of them said again.  

“I what?”  I asked.  “This is mine.  I brought it.”

“No, no,” the other one said, then said something I didn’t understand.  

“You put it back!”  The first one said again.  

The second one said something else I couldn’t understand.  

“Yeah,” I said.  “I’m here to watch the game in the shade.  I don’t know what you’re saying.”  

The first one said something else again in English.  Rather than argue, I just pretended I couldn’t understand either of them no matter what they said.  Every time they said something, I just answered with, “Okay, thank you.”  This just made them more mad.  I got them to speak louder and slower and to used different words, but I would keep answering like I had no idea what they were saying.  

At one point, one of them was saying, ""We sit here!  You move shade!  You sit there!  You move back!""  

I shrugged my shoulders and said, ""I don't know what you mean.  I'm sitting here.   This is my chair.  I brought it.""  

Those two ladies sat there and squawked back and forth, kept pointing at me, pointing at the canopy, and pointing at the shade the whole game.  As the game wore on, the shade kept moving away from my wife and me due to the angle of the sun and kept moving toward these two ladies.  I’d wait until the shade was just about to touch them before I’d get up and move the canopy again.  

TL;DR:  I put up a canopy for some shade.  Two ladies sit under it, then bitch at me for moving the shade so I'll be under it instead.

        After class I talked to the teacher and let him know what was going on. I asked him to not call him out on the cheating because I'm not an asshole. He said ok and i ended up taking the test after school so that I could show that I knew the material.
        A couple of days later we got our tests back and of course i got an A. My mark came over and asked me what i got on my test and I showed him a 96. I asked him what he got and he said that he got a zero on his test. I asked him if he studied for the test and he of course said that he didn't. I could tell that he was pissed because he knew what I did but he didn't want to admit that he was cheating off of me. The part that he couldn't figure out was how I got such a high grade and he didn't. 
         The best part was that he was the star player of the high school baseball team and probably one of the most popular guys at school. His coach is really strict about grades and once he found out that his star player had just got a zero on his test he actually had to sit out like half a weeks worth of practice and a whole game. They ended up losing that game. Needless to say he learned his lesson I came out on top.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5azyj8/to_catch_a_cheater/,pettyrevenge,150,

I actually enjoyed working there during HS but knew it wasn't a long-term gig. I was heading to college in the fall. We had our fair share of irrational customers and I usually handled the BS pretty calmly. 

Then one day a lady comes in and orders light cheese on her meal. I am at the cash register so I only take the order I don't make the food but I specified light cheese. She comes up after receiving her food and complains that there is too much cheese on her food. I look in the wrapper and there are like 5-7 pieces of shredded cheese, normally there would be twice that, and personally I'm of the opinion that she could just remove the extra cheese but I take the food back and have them remake it. I ask them to only put only like three pieces of shredded cheese on her food. 

The lady loses her mind. She comes up to the counter screaming at me that there is still too much cheese on her food and that ""your job is so easy anyone could do it."" Without missing a beat I reach under the counter where the applications are kept and bring one up and slide it towards her and say ""We're hiring."" 

At this point the manager has come to the front of the store and is taking over the situation. I'm told to go on break and when I returned everyone was laughing and couldn't believe I had done that. Seeing the look on her face was priceless. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/5at6pa/fast_food_worker_gets_their_petty_revenge/,pettyrevenge,139,

I had a few cashiers there tonight, all high school kids, let's call them Brianna, Dana, and Jim. Our Halloween shit went on clearance and of course PEOPLE WENT FUCKING NUTS. So Brianna, she's like the sweetest girl ever and will bend over backwards to help someone, and she's running around the store like crazy looking for something. She's looking for popcorn for some lady on the phone, and she finally found it. She told me this woman hid the popcorn in the store, forgot where she hid it, and asked Dana (who then transferred the call to Brianna) to find it. It was one of those 12 pack boxes of mini popcorn bags that you hand out for Halloween. So Brianna gets back on the phone, and all I hear is ""No ma'am I'm sorry we can't place items on hold... I can put it back with the Halloween candy... No I can't.. I'm sorry.. I can't.. no.."" 

So I took the popcorn out of her hand and paid for it. She got off the phone and told me the woman was screaming at her, and I just offered her a bag of popcorn. I handed bags out to Dana and Jim, and even to the customer in line behind me! I hid the box behind the counter with cookies I made for Halloween, so we could snack on them the next few days. We all had a giggle and I figured she'd maybe come in later, look on the shelf, and then just assume someone bought it.

Maybe an hour lady, some woman storms up to the register where I was stuck helping some other awful woman, and shouts ""Did I talk to you on the phone???? About the popcorn????"" I was dying I told her ""Uh.... no? There's a girl down that aisle maybe it was her???"" So I sent her to Dana, (not the girl helping her on the phone), and she told the woman she had no idea that the girl on the phone probably left, because her shift just started (3 hours into her shift). Then this lady is STILL THERE and finds Brianna and knows it's her who helped her and asks where the popcorn is. Brianna says nope, my shift just started, wasn't me, what kind of popcorn you looking for? Then the woman fucking sees the open box behind the counter and said THAT ONE!!!! Brianna told her oh no that's an open box it's our's I can't sell it to you

Earlier today we had a call, it was just a fender bender but the car that was rear ended got pushed into the left lane and held up traffic. At 4:50 pm. Rushhour. Now listen, I know traffic sucks, I get that. But I worked my normal 8 hour job and then volunteer to help people who are by and large having on of the worst days of their life... free of charge. So when I am setting up cones or flares or whatever on the highway I really don't like getting hit by a car flying by at 70 mph. Anyways, today I was setting up some flares when I woman in a white land rover straight up rolls over three of my cones and nearly hits me before even putting her blinker on to try to merge into the next lane (she was trying to get around an 18 wheeler). Bitch I think not. One of the cones got sucked up into her wheel well and she rolls down her window to SCREAM at me that she needs me to get over there and fix it, lol ok sure. I tell her to pull into the closed down lane and put her car in park. She does so, loudly complaining to me that she has been in traffic for an hour. (lady the call came in ten minutes ago, this ain't my fault or problem.) I just calmly tell her to pull over and park her car. She reluctantly does so. I follow her to where she pulled over and walk right up to her driver side window. Just as she is about to start in on me again I calmly reach my hand into her car and take her keys. Wide eyes and an open mouth turn to look at me. ""M'am you just blew through a scene of an accident and nearly hit a firefighter. Please wait right here while I go get the police officer."" The immediate babble of excuses and apologies start rolling in. I just smile and walk away. She got a big fat ticket and a court appearance. Best part is I took my sweet time going to get that cop, ""His name is Henry and he is awesome,"" he had to handle the accident first.

I had forgotten about this until I was thinking about other petty stuff I did while I worked in a meat department.

So in case you've never seen a meat department there is a long cooler with glass and you can look at the meat we have. We stood on the other side and would grab your meat, weigh it, then package it.

So one of my pet peeves when people would just point and say ""I'll have two of those"" it was really difficult to see what they were pointing to so I'd try to take an educated guess as to what they wanted and ask if it was correct. Most of the time they would get the hint and read the label so I knew what to grab.

This one pudgy lady comes in and waddles up to the case. I greet her with my fake customer service smile and she points and grunts. I ask her ""Ma'am do you want the x?"" and she just looks at me dead in the eyes and says ""That"" And looks back down at the case. I'm totally confused and her finger could be pointing at like six different things.

I bend down to look and see if I can tell where she is pointing but I have no idea. So I start naming off things in the general vicinity. She kept responded with more agitated ""Thats"". After some time I start thinking she might be illiterate and I felt bad. So I walk around to the front of the case to see if I can tell what she is pointing at. She starts pounding on the glass with her finger saying ""That one right there"" and her finger was in such a vague area I had no idea what she was asking for. 

So I go back around the case and ask ""How many would you like?"" and she says ""A few"" so I picked out the most expensive thing in the area and put six of them in a package. The total rang up to be about $75 if I remember correctly.

I handed her the package after weighing it up and she walked away without even looking at the label to see I gave her the right thing.

I had no idea what she was trying to accomplish because it was pretty clear I had no idea what she wanted. And when I asked clarifying questions she didn't really respond. So I sold a shit load of stuff to her and got a thumbs up from my boss for making a big sale.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/596nn0/that_one_she_said_as_she_pointed_vaguely_at_the/,pettyrevenge,114,

We have a beautiful lake that is perfect for setting off fireworks above for the fourth of July. We live four blocks from the beach so we know through experience to leave our cars in front of our house in order to save our parking spots but that doesn't stop people from parking across the cross walk at the corner of our lot.

So one fourth I'm sitting on my porch waiting for the wife and kids to get ready to walk down to the beach to watch the fireworks when a pickup pulls up and parks across the crossing.   An older couple get out along with their black lab who immediately trots onto my yard and lays a huge poop pile.  The couple watch this, remember I'm right there, leash the dog and head down the street.   I yell after them to clean up after their dog but they just wave me off and continue towards the beach. 

Well being a home owner I have a shovel , a love of my property and a hatred of dog crap so I fetch my shovel, scoop up the pile and proceed to smear it over the entirety of their windshield. 

After the fireworks the my whole family got to watch them try to clean their windshield with a variety of napkins and rags while swearing at us about what ass holes we were while my wife and boys laughed their heads off.

Parking is somewhat tight for us as we have five people and only five spots that are reserved for our building. On Monday when I pulled up for work I noticed that there was a car parked in the senior director's space, so he took the next best spot and so on and so forth until I was forced to park in another lot. Initially, nobody was upset as the spots aren't marked as reserved (They are in their own lot directly outside of our building), so we left a post it note under their wiper saying, ""Hi, the spaces in this lot are reserved for Technology staff only. Please park in the visitor spaces Tuesday. Thanks!"" And we left it at that.

Tuesday rolls around and this person is parked in the same space again! We're a little annoyed at this point but decide instead to leave another note that was slightly more aggressive. ""Do NOT park in these spaces. They are reserved."" We made some jokes about towing them and blocking them in, but decided against it in the end.

Wednesday, this morning, I show up for work and of course this person is back in that same spot. As a department we decide that three strikes is enough and surround this person's car with our own cars so they can't maneuver away at all. It turns out that the person was a parent helping with a theater project and at three oclock she knocked on the door to the building. She declared that we were ""very funny"" and should move our cars. We normally stay until four oclock and told her that she could wait until then for us to move. She began to swear and yell at us but we just shut the door to our building and went back to work. Four oclock comes and we all clock out to leave. As i walk past her car she gave me the most delicious death stare that followed me all the way to my car. I guess we will just have to see if she parks there again tomorrow!

Edit: Messed up the days of the week.

Thursday morning update: We did it boys! She's gone and parked in the visitor parking like she's supposed to and i didn't need to walk a mile to get to work!

Father and 2 twenty-something sons who feel compelled to scream and holler at each other at all hours of the night out front of their house.  Last night was especially bad because it wasn't constant.  They'd fight for a few minutes then stop.  Just as I was dozing off again, they'd start again.  It was a nice night and I prefer to sleep with my windows open, and it seemed that they were arguing right under my window.

This is a frequent occurrence and I've quite honestly gotten bored with just calling the cops on them - I keep hoping for extreme violence that will land them all in jail for a long time.

So this morning I decided it was time for paybacks.  I get up early, and leave for work before 7AM.  I know they're more night-owls and were arguing until at least 1AM last night, so as I left for work I went next door and banged on their door as loud as I possibly good for a solid 60 seconds.

When the father answered the door I politely asked if I had woken him up - he said yes and asked what was wrong.  I simply replied ""Nothing, thought I owed you one for keeping me up last night. Have a nice day""

After I had been there for about four years, we got a new Production Supervisor. This guy came in from a newspaper in Texas, and on his first day, he toured our press building. 

After touring the building, he told our press foreman to get rid of all chairs in the building, because he liked his pressmen to be standing at all times. This is ridiculous, because many jobs we perform are better done when sitting stably, for instance registering and setting color. Our light booths were set up at stool height, as was our press console. Standing before them made no sense; it was awkward and counter-productive. He insisted that we rid the building of all chairs regardless.

I used to live with only a friend, his gf, and his sister. We're renting a house TOGETHER, keyword there, my name is on the lease too. Lets call them Noballs, Myway, and Tara, respectively, because shit's going to get a bit complicated. 

Queue starting troubles 4 months ago, with no notice/mention/fart in the wind about a new roommate moving in, I notice the extra room's office desk is replaced with a bed. I asked Noballs about it and his response was ""Oh I forgot to tell you? Myway's sister's bf is in a pinch and needs a place for a month or two."" Forget the fact he ""forgot"" to tell me, he didn't even consider it. Lets call Myway's sister and her bf, Parentingskills and Niceguy. Whatever it's a month, two at max of cheaper rent, sure, like I said I'm a considerate guy and probably taken advantage of that quality too often. fucks left to give: diminishing.

Something you should know, Parentingskills has a 2-3 year old child from another man, she's in her early 20s. As you can imagine now that Niceguy is moved in she and the child are over all the time. And that 1-2 month deal? It's been 4. Fast forward to the beginning of last month, Noballs and Myway leave for 3 weeks vacation and all I can think is finally some peace and quiet around the house. NOPE

THE day they left, Parentingskills and her son have not, inflatable bed for the kid in the room, toys EVERYWHERE, smashing, screaming, yelling, crying, this kid is driving me insane. I politely asked just about every single god damn night, please turn down his lullaby, hey can you keep it down, can you clean up some of the mess. You'd think after a week straight of asking the same things they would catch on, nah. Now I'm getting aggravated, I'm losing sleep, it's affecting me at work and I've had enough. I lost it on them one night, I made my opinion and discomfort HEARD. Making the kid cry, Parentskills bitching at me, Niceguy saying nothing. Think this did much? For 2 nights I had peace.

Noballs and Myway have returned from their trip 2 weeks ago. The optimist I am, I thought with this at least Parentingskills and the demon child would be over less frequently. Nope, still haven't left, still losing sleep. Fucks left to give: None.

Now with the fresh month I get a text for the shared utilities bill, it's fucking $30 higher than usual (each!) and I'm living in the fucking zoo with 6 roommates HOW IN THE ACTUAL FUCK? Confront him about it, and you guessed it another ""Oh sorry I forgot to tell you, we decided to get HD cable and a landline now."" He never brought it up, didn't ask if I would like one in my room for my TV, I never even noticed the cable guys come set it up while he was on vacation, some friend he is.

By this point I'm done, I'm not paying for your stupid cable, and who the fuck gets a landline these days? I'm discreetly looking for a new place to live and I try to spend as much of my time at friends houses. But when I am home :D... This is my house too and you know what I like to do at my house? Freeballin! I'm comfortable with myself and everybody knows what a circumcised penis looks like, more importantly my roommates know what mine looks like. For the past 6 days, when I'm at home I am FREE, and oh boy doesn't it feel good. Causing issues? You bet. Legal? I have no clue. I simply just DGAF anymore and since I've started, the kid and his mother haven't been over, Noballs had some balls for once and threatened me, hahaha, ""Oh I forgot to tell you? I'm a nudist now!"" Myway isn't getting her way, but I believe she tried tested my dedication to my nudie strike by having a few of her girlfriends over. You think I'm that easily intimidated honey? Think again, I'm single bitches! That was an interesting and hilarious night for both myself and them I'm sure. And Tara? She doesn't seem to mind at all, haven't heard anything from her. Niceguy is also finally looking to move out, he was the only person who I could see putting some effort into disciplining/keeping the kid quiet for me at night.

Until I find a new place, be careful cooking in the nude, and our whole house will have a story to tell for the rest of our lives.

Like everyday it would be a pencil, paper, eraser, food, etc.  I'm a pretty giving person, but after awhile she got the expectation that I would give her shit no matter what and she just started taking stuff without asking.  So one day I brought a small tube of hand lotion, just because I recently got a new tat and would put some lotion on it throughout the day.  Anyways, this girl of course sees this and immediately asks to borrow some.  I have no idea why the hell she'd want lotion in the middle of a lecture, but to hell with it.  I'd been tired of her freeloading off of me so I decided to get my revenge. So I told her ""Of course, here"", she sticks out her hand and with a smile, I give her the biggest handful of lotion.  I'm talking like half the tube amount of lotion.  She just gives me the biggest wtf look and I return to taking notes. Totally worth the staredown I got from her for the rest of the lecture as she tried to get rid of all the lotion.

I was the first person in B line when a guy and his wife come up and stand in front of me.  There were only six or seven people in line at this time, but it was obvious he was just trying to cut in line.  Someone behind me said, ""Hey, the back of the line is back here,"" and the guy acted like he didn't know any better and moved toward the back.  

I'm at the front of the B line.  This guy and his wife go to the end of the A line.  I'm thinking I'm glad I didn't say something to him because he was going to be in the A group anyway, which meant he was still going to board before me, but as more people join that line, he lets them go in front of him and his wife, which looked really odd to me.  

It took me a few minutes to figure out what he was doing, but it became obvious that he wasn't in the A group and what he was going to do was stay at the end of the A group so that he would be the first one in the B group to board.   

When they started boarding everyone in the A group, those of us in the B line stood in place where we were supposed to be, but this guy and his wife were still there in the end of the A line, expecting to go first.  As the last few people in the A line boarded the plane, that guy looked over at me and was waving frantically for me to move the line up.  The only way his plan would work is if the two lines joined together and the person checking tickets didn't notice what he did.  

As this guy waved his arms at me, I shook my head.  He got more frantic and said, ""Come on!""  

I said, ""No, thanks.  I'll wait until I'm called.  I don't want to get sent to th back of the line.""  

Finally, that guy made it to the lady checking tickets.  She looked at his ticket an told him he'd have to go to the back of the B line.  He fussed a little bit about how he's in the B group and there were no more people in the A group that needed to board, but she stood her ground and waited until he went all the way back to the end of the B line.  

When i got ready to board, the lady checking tickets told me, ""I see this happen every day.""

On the train ride home today a woman in front of me kept talking on the phone even after people nicely asked her to be quiet.  The conductor also came through and informed her she was on a quiet car. 

The seats we are in have very little support so someone behind you could push your seat and you'd feel it. Several riders decided it wasn't worth it and switched cars. I decided I had enough and slouched far enough so both of my knees were firmly in the back of her seat pushing fairly hard. She cocked her head around and told me to put my knees down. I closed my eyes and fake slept. 

She got up and moved to a different seat. There was a person behind her and guess what he did? Knees to the back of the chair. People started catching on and she chose a seat with no one behind her. Another rider changed seats behind her and she got some more knees. 

The conductor came through again and was unaware of our little revenge. She got up and told him that people were putting knees into her back and stalking her to each spot. The conductor put his index finger to his lips and said ""Shhhh, this is a quiet car.""

She moved to a new train car.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/541ezx/quiet_train_car_revenge/,pettyrevenge,219,

We come and sit down, and I realize pretty soon that this girl in the row behind us has her feet up on my friend David's seat. She's there with one of her friends. So David turns around and he says something like, ""uh do you think you could put your feet down?"" And I think they say something in response but I didn't hear it. The feet didn't go down. A few minutes later David says, ""hey, will you get your feet off my chair? It's extremely rude."" And they still don't budge. 

So I tell David that he should go find an employee and get them to talk to this girl. He does exactly that, and after a couple minutes an employee comes and talks to this girl. She is obviously pretty peeved but begrudgingly agrees to put her feet down. 

After the employee leaves, she puts her feet right back up. 

At this point I'm pissed off. Why is it so important to you that you have your feet up on someone's chair? You're just being a brat. 

So I get out of my seat, walk up two rows, sit down in the seat directly behind this girl, and stick my foot on the back of her chair and push it forward. They both turn around and try to say something to me, but I can't really hear them since the movie had started by this point, so I just say ""just watch the movie.""

Cue a group of young, bitchy girls in blinged-out clothes deciding they don't have time to stand in line. They go to the front and stand behind the person currently paying. They pretend to be oblivious to the 4-5 other people in line now giving them death stares.

I am not in line but I see their little act. So I go along and start hooking up the ropes.  The girls are gossiping together and ignoring everyone else around them, because hey, what do they care right?

Just a short little revenge story that happened last week.

I went to a big retail store in the US, and went through to get a basket full of stuff. On the way to check out, I walked by a lady who insisted I tell her where I got an item. I told her it was towards the back of the store and which isle, and started to walk away as to get a spot in the check out line. She then blocked me from moving further, and pulled said item out of my basket and put it into hers. She said ""I just walked from all the way over there, I hope you don't mind"" and walked away. I didn't say anything to her and let her walk away.

I followed her to the garden department, and when she went to put something rather large in her basket and had her back turned, I took her basket and took it with me alllll the way to the other side of the store where that item was originally. I left my basket towards the front and hid it so she couldn't find it. On the way back to the front, I collected my things and saw the lady with an employee complaining and demanding to check the cameras.

2016-09-11 04:48:41+00:00,2377,Revenge is a dish best served with cheese.,TrendySpork,"I work at a specialty cheese shop that is swiftly expanding across the US like a wildfire. We're a pretty chill group of people who enjoy cheese and feeding people cheese (you won't know what you like until you eat it). Our customers for the most part are pleasant and easy to talk to until Raclette Lady.  

Raclette is a flavorful washed rind cheese that is traditionally melted and served with potatoes, gherkins, meats, and steamed vegetables (it also makes an amazing grilled cheese sandwich and macaroni). It's easy to see why people love it so much it's that awesome, however Raclette Lady isn't awesome and shouldn't be scraped over food people want to enjoy.  

Raclette Lady is a jerk.  

I first met Raclette Lady when she demanded that I mark down some perfectly good Raclette for no particular reason other than the fact that she demanded it. After explaining our mark down policy repeatedly and politely refusing, she told me I'm ""full of shit"". My other coworkers were also accosted by Raclette Lady who demanded they mark down the cheese for her. She comes in every few days and makes demands.  

We are so tired of her trying to bully us we've started pushing the Raclette sales so she doesn't get any pieces that we've legitimately marked down (close to sell by date). Someone asking for a cheese to pair with salami? Raclette! Someone looking for a cheese for fondue? Raclette! (as well as the usual fondue cheeses).  

We've started a militant Raclette sample strategy where we do samples with pairings constantly to push the sales even further. Any Raclette that isn't sold on markdown is bought by us so Raclette Lady doesn't get a single piece.  

She has created a monster by being a rude bully. We're doing everything in our selling power to ensure she doesn't get a single tasty morsel of that cheese (and she hasn't, so there!).

2016-09-09 14:04:14+00:00,2702,Don't mess with my grandad,Supernatantem,"So this happened with my grandad, not me. But I find it an amusing story and I just discovered this subreddit today so here you go!  

My grandad lives in a packed-in estate of terrace houses. To access the main road from his house (which is on a dead-end street), you have to drive through three other streets, so it's quite a distance, maybe just over a five minute walk. Now the houses in this estate don't have any driveways so people park on the street, and it's kind of an unspoken rule that people park half on/half off the pavement (important) so there's still enough room for a car to drive through. If someone parks fully on the road, you physically cannot park opposite them. 

Onto my grandad, he's an eighty-something year old disabled man with too many medical problems to count. He can walk, but only with a walking stick and not very well at that. He relies on his car, and being able to park outside his own home. 

Incoming asshole neighbours. This family (who live on the opposite side of the street to my grandad) have a car, a van, and three motorbikes. Aside from their kids driving about on the bikes at 2am, these guys decide that they absolutely MUST park their van outside my grandad's house because they need another parking spot. My grandad also went out a lot to various doctors/hospital appointments, and to tend gardens. (He's retired obviously, but was a gardener for most of his life and still loves his plants.) Perfect opportunity for them to steal his spot.  

Several times he has to knock on their door to ask them to let him have his parking spot because he's an old man who can barely walk, never mind trying an extra five minute (more like 15 minutes at the speed he goes) walk from the main road to his car. Nope was always the answer.  

Now, my grandad has begun to dislike these asshats, so he does what he knows best. Petty revenge. Rings up the council (or whoever is in charge of these things), flashes his blue disability badge, and asks them to paint a disabled parking spot on the road outside his house because he has trouble getting a spot. Sure thing buddy.  

A few days later, they're out painting his little disabled parking spot. I'm not sure if you guys have seen them before, but they're fully in the road. Now let me remind you how people park half on and half off the road in this estate. My grandad knew he *could* park half on the pavement, but of course that's wasting half of his disabled parking spot! So he decides it's best to park fully on the road from now on.  

Cue angry opposite-neighbours. Later that evening they returned home to see they couldn't park outside their house at all and they were pissed. They ended up ringing the council to complain, but because my grandad was a blue badge holder and the spot was outside his house and council-approved, they got nowhere. Now they have to park both their car, and van on the street.  

My grandad had the biggest grin on his face when he told us about it.

The elevator was very small, very old school and had signage everywhere about how you couldn't operate it with more than 4 people. I'd also been stuck in there twice already that weekend (the elevator would stop between floors). Each time, I called the front desk and they were able to recall it to the ground floor but I'd learned to be wary. 

I should have started taking the stairs, but was on the 8th floor and was feeling lazy. So on Sunday morning I waited for the elevator for quite a while (it was pretty slow). It arrives, I hop in and a family of 5 walks up to the elevator and follows me in. They were all large people and they all had huge suitcases. I politely pointed out the sign and said that I'd already been stuck in the elevator twice and that we should split the group into two. They laughed and said they were all staying on. Welp, I thought, enjoy your ride. 

I proceeded to run up the stairs and hit the call button on every single floor. The best part was that I could hear them complaining from the stairwell every time the elevator opened and nobody was there.

2016-09-03 05:53:12+00:00,2478,Screw over the neighbourhood and have your beach views revoked,NotATerryWrist,"My family and I live in nice suburb about a block away from a great beach, we moved in a couple of years ago. The community is on a slight hill, so everyone enjoys a small view of the sea and bay from their houses and everyone knows everyone else. 

Previously the neighbours had all gotten along and been friendly, but that all changed just before we moved in. The house next to ours (which was some prime real estate)had been bought by some developers, who planned to tear it down and put up some double story gaudy monstrosity full of small units. Many of the neighbours took issue with this, as the community is full of single story houses, and a double story would be able to peep into everyone's backyards as well as blocking people's views of the bay. 
So a lot of the neighbours took action to prevent it being constructed: they signed petitions, threatened legal action, did everything possible to try and stop it from happening. 
Eventually after a few months of this, developers decide it's too much bother, and sell property to someone else. Neighbours celebrate their victory over nasty unfeeling developer and think that's the end of that. 

A few weeks later, a local couple who had been spearheading the effort to drive the developers out of the place, bought the property they had been fighting so hard to preserve. Then they promptly demolished it. Then surprise surprise they built AN EVEN BIGGER AND TALLER two story house than the developers had originally planned. They sold their own house and moved a couple of doors down into their new one after it had been built. Naturally everyone felt pretty pissed off but didn't ultimately challenge it that much, the couple indicated they would fight tooth and nail to build what they wanted. They were no longer invited to some local BBQs but that was the only real repercussion. They now have superb views of surrounding area and beach at everyone else's expense. 

Anyway so we move in shortly after all this, and hear from many annoyed neighbours how the couple basically fucked everyone and can now see into everyone else's yards. With out backyard facing their balcony, my dad decides he wants a little more privacy, and plants some very large and sturdy trees right at the back of our property along the fence line. 
As our house is situated between theirs and the beach, these trees when fully grown in a couple of years, will block out any view they might have of the beach. In addition, the trees will be mostly unprotected from winds coming off the bay, while they can live through such winds they will undoubtedly shed a shit ton of leaves into their nice clean pool and yard.

there is this bar in West philadelphia in my neighborhood that i occasionally go to. Its a unique bar in that it sits in the cultural center of the neighborhood, which depending on which way you turn out of the bar and walk 5 minutes, could bring you through several dramatically different socio-economic situations.  I say this because this bar attracts a very eclectic mix of people and cultures of all ages. 

This one night, 2 Saturdays ago, a few friends, our girlfriends,  and i go to this bar. we get there early enough so that we can snag some couches from the lounge area (which are never available) and settle in for a night of regrettable city-wides.  after a drink or two we decided to grab the ""cards against humanity"" game off the game rack and all settled in and started playing. after a few turns around, we are having a good ol' time, before we are interrupted by a stumbly drunk early 50's woman who is literally repeatedly yelling ""PUT DOWN YOUR PHONES."" we are all really caught of guard and looking around at eachother confused. she continued to yell it a few more times before going on a tangent and ripping us all apart for ""all being on our phones and not talking to each other."" granted, we were all sitting there looking down at our own hand of cards when she was walking by, but nonetheless it was an obnoxious inaccurate accusation.  Several of us tried to interrupt her over the course of her tirade, but she clearly had an axe to grind and didnt care to listen to us as she continued loudly talk-yelling over us in a drunk blind rage about how ""your generation doesn't know how to speak to each other any more, you always have your face buried in your phones, blah blah"" after about a minute of loudly generalizing an entire generation of people, i finally stand up from the couch and put my hand of cards into her face to show her exactly what was going on.  she was awkwardly kind of taken aback and didn't know what to say, as she was very proud of herself and her generation for bellowing her speech onto us shit-bag millennials.  She gave this weird drunken half apology and shuffled away back to the bar without truly understanding how stupid and obnoxious she just came off.  

the night went on and we forgot about it until we were leaving. the 6 of us walked past the bar to the exit when we see the woman nestled into the corner of the bar. she is sitting there with her half finished drink, face buried into her phone and the friend she was clearly there with was doing the same. 

My friend looked at me, smiled, then walked over to her (she did not see him approaching) and leaned over close to her ear and in the most condescending tone he could muster spat out ""put.down.the.phone."" the woman popped up all surprised that someone snuck up on her like that and we promptly all left. cackling into the night. so proud of ourselves.

The second I start unloaded the basket, the cashier makes eye contact me and says, ""Is that less than 15 items?""

I replied something along the lines of, ""Uh, yeah I'm pretty sure,"" assuming she was kidding.

She gave me the nastiest glare and demanded, ""count them.""

Again, assuming this was some rude joke, scoffed and finished unloading. She kept glaring at me, and once again demanded that I count my items before she rang me up.I humor her and slowly count out my items, and lo and behold, I have well below 15 items.

Right as she's done aggressively ringing up my items I say,

""Oh, and this please."" tossing a pack of gum onto the counter.

She rings it up.

""Oh, this looks good, too."" A Kit Kat is added to my haul.

This continues until I'm left buying 16 items from a very frustrated cashier at the 15 items or less lane.

I left and enjoyed the first of 7 treats on my walk home.

2016-08-21 01:41:48+00:00,2657,Maybe sales people shouldn't mess with their cashiers,Puggy_Ballerina,"So, I'm a cashier at a hardware store. The sales people on the floor have stickers and/or employee numbers that they attach to big ticket items to get ""credit"" for it. They don't make commission, but it is kept track of in our systems so it can be looked up and we can see who makes the most money for the company in each department and sometimes small bonuses are given, but they're not expected or required. It's mostly bragging rights and bargaining chips for promotions and raises.

Tammy in the Lumber department is not a nice lady to cashiers. I don't know why, but somehow she feels that if we make a mistake and sell something wrong from her department, it is a personal insult to her, despite there being at least 4 more people who work in that department. 

So, she takes it upon herself to leave her department and come to the front of the store to read the riot act to any cashier that rang something up wrong. Now, normally, if a cashier makes a mistake, the person who finds it let's them know in a civil, calm manner or the cashier notices their accuracy numbers are down and tries to fix it themselves. Tammy is the only person in the store who feels it necessary to loudly, and angrily lecture the cashiers. On the clock. In front of customers and coworkers. Keep in mind, that a cashier making a mistake doesn't actually effect her personally very much at all. At the most, inventory might be off because someone sold a 2x2x8 oak that was actually a 2x2x8 fir, which, yes, is annoying but not worth humiliating a human being who made a human error. 

After the second time she chewed me out, I decided that hmm... oh jee whiz, when she sells $400 worth of stuff, when I ring it up, oh boy, I just didn't happen to SEE her employee number on it. Despite it being right next to the barcode.

I've told one other cashier who adopted this practice (who told another... who told another...) and so far it's quietly spread across at least half the cashiers who've been disrespectfully shouted at and talked down to by Tammy. Most of us have now memorized her 6 digit number so even if she sneaks it on there, just numbers by themselves instead of including her name too, we still won't add it.

Guess whose no longer the #1 sales person in lumber anymore? She's not even in the top 3 as of two weeks after ripping me a new one. 

Maybe don't screw with your cashiers.

Edit: hey, happy ending. Early this morning, Tammy came at the head cashier. I just watched the head cashier have a meeting with the store manager, then they both talked to Tammy. From what I overheard, they explained that cashiers are not lumber experts. That we cannot tell the difference between pine and oak or spruce and cedar, that lumber needs to keep up with marking the different types. Then they walked her through how the mistake was made (you have to type in ""5/4 x 3x3 ft"" not ""5/4x3x3ft"" or any other variation, or the correct item won't come up at all. Yeah, our system is fucking stupid sometimes), and the fact that cashiers are also expected to be able to tell apart at least 20 different kinds of electrical wire from that department, hundreds of different kinds of pipe and pieces from plumbing, and the fact that barely 4 out of 15 or so cashiers, have been here for more than half a year. We are doing our best. 

She smiled and nodded and did the charming act, then walked away and maybe 5 minutes later, ripped into the store helper about leaving something on the Lumber desk instead of putting it away. Despite the fact that everyone could hear the store helper being called to 3 different places to help customers with load outs.

In a fit of rage at having to climb through my passenger side I approach his truck knowing I must do something to correct this injustice. The truck bed has a cooler inside and I flipped the lid off to reveal several ice cold beverages. I decided to help myself to a Coke. I left the lid off so that the ice will melt and the driver of the terribly parked truck will know his cooler has been compromised. Then I ate my long awaited pretzel and enjoyed a nice cold coke that tasted like sweet justice. Inconvenience me by making me crawl through my passenger side and it will cost you one pop.

2016-08-16 00:05:23+00:00,2226,Condescending Manager,stewietm,"I've worked at my current hotel more than long enough that at any other business I would be treated as if I was just as competent as any other employee. But unfortunately I have the weirdest most baby talky mother fucker of a manager.

 But I was warned when I first started working here by the previous new person that this behavior will continue until their is another new person. She apparently had dealt with this for 3 years.....


On to the story.

My Manager starts hovering as he usually does cause I'm ""new"" and starts saying things like ""you could do this to make it faster"" or ""I usually click these buttons"" but the one thing he says that pisses me off more than anything is when he says ""f1 THEN f5, to save and checkout the folio"" like bitch I can remember two things damn! All of these little suggestions are always unprompted.

But I have one thing up my sleeves. I'm younger and better then him at anything technology related. So obviously I decided to switch that little shortcut to f5 first then f1.

The next day he starts his usual suggestions all the while I'm waiting for ""f1 then f5"". He finally says it and the following interaction occurred.

&gt;me: Hah so you're trying to mess me up now? That's new.

&gt;him: What?

&gt;me: Its always been f5 then f1.

Approaches computer after letting out the most fucking sarcastic sigh I've ever heard. 

&gt;him: No no no seee...

He stands their confused as nothing happens when he hits f1 and im just sitting their watching him but I decide to mess with him more.

&gt;me:Is this some sort of weird test? Why are you doing it wrong?

&gt;him:No its always been this way..... (he really trailed off like mindfuck trailed off)

&gt;me:Well here comes some customers let me take over again.

He walks away looking extremely confused, as hes walking away

&gt;him:Okay.... Okay... Right

I really hope that ends his hovering. Sorry If I butchered formatting.

I used to work for a retail hardware shop and we had a small wood workshop where I used to be every saturday.
Basically it goes like this: Customer gets over here, orders the kind of wood and size he wants, I note it and tell him, how much time this is going to take depending on current workload.

The day in question was a normal day, medium work to do, so the customers usually get their stuff in 20-30 minutes (this is usually my normal estimate, so I can react if something else interferes, like another customer). 

A customer comes to my desk and orders a piece of wood with some special small stuff on it, not much work for me (we have a wall mounted circular saw for stuff like this). 
I told him the usual 30 minutes and that was it, I started to go to work.

...so I thought…

He wanted it faster, asked if I could do his order first, since it is so small.
I told him that this is not how we operate. He started to argue, being an ass, threatened to call the boss, you know how they do it…

After 5 minutes of arguing, I saw a regular customer come in, and he basically only ever wanted some small cuts, which are even easier.

As he was approaching I finally told him, that now special for him, I will do the easy tasks first, went back to the workshop (there is a door to hold the noise back in), and started working on his order for about one minute, only to go to the desk to service the regular…
As usual, only the 3 cuts and he will be gone. But the other, angry, customer was still waiting like a shark.

So I smiled to the regular and said: “Sure, I’ll do it right now, this is a fast task.”

Now my story would end here, but it still gets better:

He was so angry, he went to my boss and complained about it. Boss goes to the workshop and gathers my version of the story, then tells me to come and have a conversation with him and the customer.

Boss proceeds to lecture the angry customer how it is my part to guarantee for my safety in the workshop and manage the time myself. Customer gets even angrier and threatens to never visit the store again. Boss takes his order and rips it in half. Customer leaves.

5 Minutes before closing time my boss brought me a cold beer.
This feels so good.

My office is set up to be nice and open.  We are a small office, consisting of 5 people.  My co-worker, who sits closest to me, has the manners of a wild animal.  She never washes her hands, doesn't cover her mouth when she sneezes, and makes all of the doorknobs smell like cigarettes from her chain smoking.  The worst of her offenses is her noise level.  She talks to her obnoxiously loud daughter every single day on facetime, for at least 20 minutes.  Her daughter and grandchildren live in Scotland so Facetime it is... on speaker.  Those disgusting creatures (daughter included) will belch, fart, scream, laugh, for the entire chat.  They need some Gas-x in their lives.  I have asked her to go outside to talk because I can't hear my clients, but she said it is too hot and there is nowhere else to talk other than her desk.  Aside from her conversations, my co-worker also chews the crunchiest foods with her mouth open.  Her mouth sounds as though someone is trying to cheese grate rocks.  We have to deal with these things because she has worked here for 30 years and the boss loves her.  She is also a diligent worker bee.    

My revenge is simple.  I went to Frys (local electronic store) and found a new mechanical keyboard.  Now when she answers her phone, or eats her concrete chips, I start mashing away.  CLICK CLACK CLICKITY CLACK CLACK.  I think the negative reinforcement training is working  because today she went to her car to talk to her daughter.  She came back up drenched in sweat.  Success!

edit:  A lot of people think I smell the actual doorknob... I do not.  The smell is transferred to my hand when I open the door.  Sometimes I forget to wash my hand after, and get a nasty whiff when I go to push my glasses up, or scratch my face.

How about a nice surprise.,2ManyToots,"For those of you who don't know what a Chromecast is, it's a small little dongle that you plug into your T.V. and it allows you to stream most media to it.  I purchased one several months ago, and have left it in the living room so that we can all enjoy it.

One of my roommates, who is an alright guy, has recently started to take it from the living room into his room so that he and his girlfriend can watch T.V. in there, leaving the rest of us having to watch anything on our computers or phones, which, is a minor inconvenience, I know, but still it ticks me off.

Being that you can stream from any room in the house as long as the Chromecast is connected to a T.V., I decided to wake him and his girlfriend up from a nap with the beautiful moans and grunts of porn.  He quickly turns the T.V. off to hide it, which I quickly realized.  But..the Chromecast can turn on a T.V. when you decide to cast it, so I do it once again.  He turns the T.V. off again, and lo and behold, I do it once more.  He finally unplugs the Chromecast from his T.V., and later brings it in the living room.

Needless to say, we've been able to enjoy Netflix and Hulu on our big T.V. in the living room without having to get it back from him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4w73q6/keep_stealing_my_chromecast_how_about_a_nice/,pettyrevenge,218,

I tend to stay until around 10:55 but if someone ordered at 10:56 I'd probably still take it.

I was cashing up and at 10:53, a group of drunk - and I mean staggering drunk can't hold themselves up - 14 year old teenagers stroll up. There's 30 of them. I've worked a 14 hour shift today and I can't be fucked. I politely tell them we're closed and one smug cock fucker decides to start using the one piece of legislation he can remember from his year 7 general studies lesson.

&gt; Me: *Seeing where this is going* Yes.

&gt; Him: Hmmm. *looking at an imaginary watching on his wrist* And is it not 10:55

&gt; Me: I'm the manager. I decide the closing shift.

Boom. Roasted. He's fucked off outside. But now his friends have got the same idea. They're yelling at me how we don't close when we say we will and how we 'suck'. They're trying to bribe me into taking orders by telling me that four orders of chips will be worth the money. I've taken £1500 in four hours. £8 won't make me homeless. One of them calls me a bitch, fantastic, keep it coming. 

They're still ranting and then one of them drops the bomb: We'll order from [Insert other Chinese here]. Alright, it's go time. I know that [Other Chinese] closes the same time we do. I know that they, unlike me, will take orders up until 11 and then wait for you. But if you order after 11 you're shit out of luck. This Chinese is a 30 minute walk away if you're sober, and we all know drunk teenagers take twice as long. 

You've kept me here arguing for four minutes and called me a bitch. It's fucking on. I kept them talking until 11:01 and then told them all to leave or I'd phone the police. Locked up and walked past them all jeering about how they were going to phone [Other Chinese] and spend so much money. Waved a cheery: Have a nice time at [Chinese that has now been closed for 1 minute].

I had something similar happen to me. Now I dunno how you handled your situation but I was a monster dick in how I handled mine.

The short version of events went down like this. This dude I had been crushing on needed a ride back to his apt from the school library, he previously made it clear he had no interest in me but he led me to believe that we would fuck around when we got to his place (gay dude here, btw and I would have given him a lift home if he just asked but he used sex to get me to do it) but when we got there he gave me some lame ass excuse that his roommate was home and was fighting with his boyfriend and consequently we couldn't fuck. I realized I was played, he had no intention of messing around with me, he just wanted a ride home and decided to take advantage of the dude with low self-esteem.

So a couple of months go by and I'm back in the library and we run into each other again. He's all apologetic about the last time and asks if I'm still interested. I go along with it and say sure and SURPRISE, he needs a ride back to his apt again. And again, I say sure but I need to run an errand first. He agrees to come with me. So we drive about 20 min to this place I need to go to, I apologize saying I didn't realize it was so far out, I thought it was closer, he acted cool about it, but I knew he was mad. We go into the store and I tell him ""Hey, to speed this up, can you run over to aisle x and grab this item while I get this other item."" He says sure and off he goes in the direction I tell him. As soon as he is out of visual contact, I high tail it out, jump into my car and take off, leaving him abandoned on the outskirts of Lubbock, probably 30min+ from his apt.

He hits me up online later that night, pissed as hell and I just tell him ""Oh...sorry man, I had to run...my roommate was fighting with his boyfriend and I had to get home.""


Edit:  A few people asked where I dumped his stupid ass, I cannot recall the name of the store but for those familiar with Lubbock, it was past the North Loop and 27.

As I'm pulling in, I see a pair of open pumps. My sister had told me earlier that the near pump was faulty and did not let her purchase a car wash, so I started to go for the far pump. As I'm about to pull up, some big SUV comes screaming up to the far pump, pulling up so far that he blocked me from even using the near pump. I was extremely confused, as I had noticed that the gas cap for the SUV was on the left side of the vehicle, but in his rush the driver had pulled up with the right side facing the pump.

Since the SUV pulled up so that we were facing each other, the driver and his passenger were able to see my face, and I theirs. They were laughing and pointing as the driver got out to pump gas while I just sat there, blocked from the pump.

The driver went to unscrew the gas cap, but realized he had pulled up on the wrong side. As he went to get back into his car to fix the issue, another car pulled up behind me. 

And so a plan was formed: as the obnoxious SUV driver pulled out to try and realign his car with the pump, I pulled all the way forward and the driver behind me pulled up to the second pump. As I got out to pump gas into my car, the SUV driver comes extremely close to hitting my car and gives me the finger. Whatever, I'm getting my gas and car wash and you have to go elsewhere.

 I am an anesthesiologist, and back when I was doing my residency training there was this loud-mouth prick orthopedic surgeon at the hospital I worked. Let's call him Greg. He was always bitching about anesthesia delaying him, was never happy, and talked in this loud abrasive tone. Basically treated everyone like peons around him. One day I was in his room wearing a lead apron as we were doing a case that required intra-op X-rays. Unbeknownst to me, I had grabbed the personalized lead aprons of one of his colleagues, Dr. Smith  who was not working that day. As the case is going, Greg looks up and sees I am wearing Smith's lead apron. He stops what he is doing and asks me, ""are you Dr. Smith?"" I replied that no I wasn't. He then proceeds to flip out and ask ""why the hell are you wearing his lead then?!? Take it off now and get another different lead apron at the rack!"" (The rack had literally 10-15 other lead aprons that weren't personalized).
Me being a lowly resident at the time, I  bit my tongue and changed lead aprons in front of all the other coworkers in the room because this prick was making such a big deal out of it. A belittling experience and it made me hate the shit out of this guy.
The revenge:
One day soon after that experience, I grabbed some lunch at work and went into the lounge to eat. The lounge was empty, so I started to eat my hospital cafeteria sandwich in peace. While eating, I noticed a white coat that physicians wear hanging on a rack. I looked at the name and saw it belonged to that prick orthopedic surgeon Greg. After checking to make sure nobody else was in the lounge, I got up and grabbed the sopping wet pickle spear that came with my lunch and placed it in Dr. Greg's white coat pocket and left. Why?

2016-07-26 20:36:37+00:00,5743,"It's only fair, right?",ALLFATHER2233,"I work at a logistics company and my job is to find drivers to take freight from A to B. I work with the same trucking companies a lot, but sometimes I get one-off drivers. This is one of those. 


A truck driver calls me asking about a load for the next morning coming out of Laredo TX going to Portland OR. 


TD: What is rate?


Me: We can pay $3,500 on it


TD: How about $4,000? 


Me: Sorry, customer is strict about the rate on this one. Has to be 35.


TD: Oh man, I need this. I need to get home to see my son and my wife is sick. 


Me: Then we need 35 on it. Customer will not go higher. 


The guy ends up taking it. If you think I’m being too hard on him, keep in mind there really isn’t a whole lot heading from TX&gt;OR at any given time, so I could try to get him his rate but I’d risk losing the load to another driver. If he really needs to get back, why does he want to go back and forth negotiating on price and risk it? 


The answer is because he’s full of shit. 


The next morning I get a call from the customer saying that the facility that’s receiving the freight has been changed. It’s still going to be in Portland, just in a different place. Something like a 20-30 mile difference, tops. Should be a complete non-issue, considering the driver has just started a 2,200 mile journey, so it’s a drop in the bucket. 


I call him back.


Me: Hey, just a heads up, receiver called to say that it’s going to deliver at a different address. It’s XXXX, Portland, OR


TD: Oh well, you can send me rate confirmation with little bit more money. 


Me: … What do you mean?


TD: Agreement has changed, need to renegotiate. 


Me: … seriously? It’s like a 20-30 miles difference from the original one. 


TD: 20-30 miles is kind of long way to go. 


Me: (humoring him) Okay what do you think you need for the new rate? 


TD: Ehhh, $4,000 should do it. 


*OOOOOH REALLY? THE ORIGINAL RATE YOU WANTED HUH? WOW WHAT A COINCIDENCE.* 


Me: Are you serious? 


TD: It’s only fair. 


I put the driver on hold just to spite him for trying to handle me like that, and I start working on something else. Out of curiosity, I check the address for the original delivery facility compared to the new one. Turns out the new receiver is actually 25 miles *closer* to the shipper in Laredo. New travel distance is 2,175 miles. I pick his line back up. 


Me: Hey we will change up the rate after all. 


TD: (very excited) Okay, send to me the confirmation.


Me: Okay, we ran the miles and the new receiver is actually 25 miles *closer* to Laredo, so we’re going to need to reduce the rate to $3,000. 


TD: Wha… *what are you talking about??*

Me: Well, we’re cutting 25 miles off the trip and it’s kind of a lot of miles to cut. It’s only fair, right? 


TD: Ahhh, ah hah hah hah… ahhhh so, ah that's… yeah, so $3,500 still good?

2016-07-24 13:08:14+00:00,2757,Revenge at the DMV,PegasusCoffee,"I work for the Department of Motor Vehicles. In Texas, this means I process vehicle registration and titles, along with handicapped placards and provide information about how to minimize personal liability if your vehicle is stolen, or was never removed from your name. It's actually an enjoyable job, despite what many think, but it takes a specific understanding of the clientele to get a feel for the job: These are people who *have* to be here. They have a right to be grumpy, and they've got a right to bring their screaming, unbehaved crotchspawn if they can't find someone to watch them at home.

Just last week, I was dealing with a group of three-- a daughter, and her parents who've made the bold assumption that blue blazers and khaki shorts are all the rage--, who were none to happy to be at my office. Their first sin was to attempt to skip the line (which led to other, patient customers explaining the dynamics of the first-come-first-served queuing). Next, they continued to lean over the line barriers, towards our windows, to ask a myriad of questions. I don't mind questions that can be answered with short, one-sentence answers (Hours of operation, county lines, things of that nature), but they're asking me for details on the finer points of title transfer. **While I'm handling another customer**. When I explain to them ""I'll be happy to answer your questions when I'm helping you"", I get a big, loud scoff and hear the father say ""That sounds about like the government for ya'.""

Charming.

Our queue lines are sort of a corral system- there's one big line, five-six clerks, and the next available clerk takes the next person in line. As luck would have it, the lovely group of three saunters over to my window, already huffing and scoffing at the wait (13 minutes. Yes, I kept track).

Me:""What are we--""

Dad: ""Alright we're selling our daughter a car!""

Me: ""Alright, selling, or giving?""

Dad: ""I guess... giving?""

Me: ""Alright, no problem. There's gonna be a little bit more paperwork,"" I explain as I retrieve the Gift Affadavit, a paper that takes no more than four minutes to fill completely, ""but we should have--""

Mom: ""I don't wanna be here all day! It's a sale!""

Me: ... ""Alright, how much are you selling the vehicle for?""

Dad: ""ONE DOLLAR!"" At this point, Dad looks to his Daughter, who looks at me as if I'm the cause of all her misery, produces a single, crumpled dollar from her miniature purse, and hands it to Dad.

Me: ""Alright, it's a sale.""

**Note:** In Texas, there's two values you can be taxed on; one of them is the sale price, but there's something called the Standard Presumptive Value (SPV). The SPV is taking the vehicle's Year, Make, and Mileage (or a flat EXEMPT if the vehicle is 10 years old, or other), getting the value of those three criteria, and taking 80% of that value. That 80% is the SPV, and if it's *higher* than what you paid, we have to tax on that amount.

**This was a 2013 Acura. It was worth more than $1.**

At this point, I'm wondering if I should explain this to the trio as I'm highlighting the appropriate parts of an application to fill out (you know, so we don't have to be here all day?). The Dad asks me what I'm doing, and as I explain the color-coding (Dad is Orange, Mom is Pink, Daughter is Yellow), he proudly explains; ""This ain't preschool, kid, give 'er here."" and beckons for the applications. 

Well, the first application was trashed in a matter of seconds, as all the incorrect information was put into the incorrect boxes. The second one was filled out by Dad instead of the Daughter. By the beginning of the third one (which was promptly filled out wrong once more), I've begun to highlight a fourth application to save them the embarrassment of their supposed illiteracy. And sure enough, just as I finish up, I hear the sheepish bleating ""Hey, you got another one'a those?"" All the while, I'm listening to a chorus of jokes at my expense, all of which relegating to the fact that I'm a public employee, with the added, salty bonus of the Daughter muttering ""They probably just hired him to fill some kinda quota."" Thanks, toots.

I make sure to keep it on my side of the glass and explain to the Daughter what *she* needs to fill out. At this point, Mom pipes up with ""If you keep us here any longer, that car's gonna be a Classic by the time it's in her name!"" Cute.

Up until this point, I've been weighing the idea of ""turning a blind eye"" to the sale that went over, and explaining the option of a gift transfer, which is a flat $10. Their irate bickering, inability to follow directions, and belittling has turned that option into an idyllic fantasy.

With a completed title and application, we get through the transaction, while Dad and Daughter take turns complaining about having to wait in line, and having to be at the DMV. And then I hit them with the total:

Me: Beaming, I say ""alright, it's gonna be $934.""

Dad: ""WHAT?! How the hell you figure that?!"" He slams his palm onto my counter- I hope your hand is still stinging, guy.

Mom: ""Oh, that can't be right! What'd you do?!""

Me: ""Well, it's $822.50 for the sales tax, $78.50 to renew the expired tags, and $33 for the Title Application fee.""

Dad: ""I'm sorry, *how much* for the sales tax?""

Me: ""$822.50."" I explain the virtues of SPV while the Dad glares at me as if I'm chanting to Satan and drawing a pentagram over his signature.

Dad: ""I'm not paying that sales tax. Can't you just go by the dollar?""

Me: ""Afraid not, sir. Now, we can accept a card, but there's a 2.34% processing fee, a check if your check and--""

Dad: ""It's a gift. Can we do it as a gift?""

Me: ""It's not a gift, sir. You sold it to her for $1. I witnessed the exchange, and therefore cannot tax it as a gift."" I'm determined to be as little help as possible by now.

Dad: ""Isn't there SOMETHING we can do?""

Me: ""Well, you can pay for the transaction.""

Dad: ""Alright, lemme speak to your boss.""

While I work for the public sector, the *amazing* thing about my job is that our policies are backed up by Texas State Law. Which means, if someone has a problem with something in our office, 9 out of 10 times, it's tough shit. My supervisor comes out to assess the situation. Dad explains it's a gift, I explain I saw money change hands for the transaction, and surprise surprise, my supervisor backs me up:

Supervisor: ""I'm sorry, sir, but if money was exchanged for this-- which I did see from my office, by the way-- it's subject to SPV. Did he explain SPV to you?""

Mom: ""This is criminal! We're selling the vehicle to our daughter!""

Supervisor: ""I'm sorry, but the State of Texas charges on SPV if it's higher than the sale price. If you have any issues with it, you can contact the Comptroller and apply for a refund.""

At this point, Dad relents:

Dad: ""Alright, look, I'm not paying a thousand dollars to sell the vehicle to my daughter. Is this,"" he held up the title, referring to the signatures on the back, ""going to affect things?""

Me: ""Yes, sir. You'll need to get a new title when you go to sell, or trade the vehicle in.""

Dad: ""Where can I get that.""

2016-07-22 14:32:39+00:00,2242,Drive through lady,Dognado,"There is a bank by my house with a drive up atm. The way it works is that the atm is built into the wall of the bank so only the left most lane can use it and the other 2 lanes are for something else. 
So I pull up to the atm to get some cash and this Lexus with a woman and her daughter pulls up behind me. It's after the bank closed so this is the only atm that can be used. The lady waits about 30 seconds before getting out of her car and asking what's taking so long. I had been there about 30 seconds, during that time I took my wallet out of my pocket an put my card in the atm. Now I had to take it out and she was saying something about being in a hurry and needing to get her daughter to a party. I tell her to move so I can finish up. As she walks away I do my business. She sees me take the money and starts honking at me to move. 
I decide that I need to check my balances. I do that.  She honks again. I decide I need more money. This time she gets out of her car again and comes up and yells, ""what the fuck is taking you so long. My daughter is in a hurry and your dicking around"". 
I look at her for a second and say, ""I think I need to check my balances again"". She looks at me with the most angry look I have ever seen some one give. She just walks away and gets in her car. She puts it in reverse and drives away. 

Short version: I took too long at an atm and some lady got pissed. I make her wait and the she drives away. 

Edit: For those of you saying it's rude to do something like that, I normally just take out money and go. I checked the balances and stuff one time because this lady was being a bitch. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4u31bn/drive_through_lady/,pettyrevenge,148,
2016-07-21 22:20:56+00:00,2481,If the customer before me was a bitch. I guess I should keep the ball rolling and be a bitch myself.,ddeellyynn,"I used to work at a bakery. We get really nice customers most of the time. Then we get customers that just hate life and want to complain about every little thing or even out right lie about an order just so they can get it for free. Well actually that happens quite often. 

Anyway, a lady comes in and I hand her her order. Someone accidentally put the wrong label on her order. It was a 1/4 sheet cake label for $19.48 instead of $9.98 1/8 sheet cake. She's freaking out. Wanting to speak to a manager. Calling me names. It was an easy fix so I don't know why she had to go crazy like that. I go to our label machine and print out the correct label with bar code. I tell her that a manager wouldn't be needed unless there's something actually wrong with her cake. She's staring at it. Looking for anything wrong with it. Thankfully nothing. She takes her new label and leaves because she's running late.  She claims she didn't have time to be bullshitting... Right...

So naturally everyone's staring. It's a Saturday. We're really busy. I go on to help the next customer. I'm hoping she'll be nicer or even feel a little bit sorry for me. 

Nope-she isn't. She has a bitchy grin and tells me her last name. I hand her her order. She tells me to take the cake out so she can examine it. I do so. She's looking at it. Nothing wrong with it.  I swear she looked upset that her order was correct.  I put the cake back in the packaging. I last minute notice that on the corner of the sheet board of her cake its marked that it has strawberry filling. The label reads 1/4 sheet cake for $14.98. When her cake is a 1/4 sheet cake with filling which should be $17.98. I never would've noticed if she had just taken her order. So I tell her. Apologize for our mistake.  I walk off before she can respond. Print off the correct one. I tear off her old label and replace it. Hand her her cake and tell her to have a nice day. She stood there dumbfounded. Even a little pissed off that she could've gotten away with paying less. I can tell she wanted to say something. But she already felt like an ass for being a bitch for no reason. It was her own damn fault. Most of the time I just disregard minor details like that and move on. 

As she walks away. I tell my bakery crew that we need to make sure we're printing out the right labels. She turns around and gives me a hateful look. I just ignored her. 

We make mistakes. But we're really good about fixing them and giving discounts when necessary. Or even if we get a really nice and understanding customer. We really hook them up. Ah- gotta love customer service jobs.

2016-07-18 01:12:57+00:00,2534,"Save 20 seconds, lose 5 minutes, b----.",Falcon10301,"Recently, I attended a sewing summer camp. Pretty fun, ""counselor"" was super chill and most of the other ""campers"" (note: I use quotation marks because those words make me think of sleepaway camps where you go on hikes and sit around the campfire and all that jazz; but this was a 3 hour day camp at a school) were nice. 

There was one girl, however, who seemed to think that she was some kind of special snowflake because of about a year's worth of experience over the rest of us. Let's call her Soccer Mom In-Training. Finish your project 10 minutes after her because you were being careful? ""ohmygosh you're sooo slow."" Prick yourself on a pin? ""Wow you're so clumsy, learn to sew."" Verbal assault doesn't bother me like some people, so I just took it.

Then one day, she escalated it. 

I was at a mat for cutting fabric, because those rotary fabric cutters are sharp as hell and you have to do it on a special mat or you'll cut up the table. There were only 3 of those mats for 10-12 campers, so sometimes you had to wait. It was common courtesy to let someone who needed to do a quick cut go ahead of you if you were taking a long time.

 So as I was saying, I was at a mat when I realized I needed a piece of fabric I'd left by my machine for my last cut. In the 10 seconds I took to grab it, SMI-T decides to rudely sweep my fabric, which was painstakingly perfectly aligned for an efficient cut, to the floor. I awkwardly picked up my pieces and got in line behind her. Then she proceeded to take several minutes cutting out all the pieces of her bag she was making, even the pieces she didn't need until later, to spite me. 

Was I going to take this lying down?! Alright, normally I probably would...but not today SMI-T, not today. 

I waited patiently, pretending all was well for all of 30 minutes, until my chance came. She left to use the restroom. Under the pretense of going to iron my already-ironed strap, I surreptitiously switched the stitch selection on her machine(for those who do not know, sewing machines can stitch in different ways--straight, zigzag, double, etc) from the basic option to a wide zigzag. Since she didn't need to switch the stitch selection for her particular project, when she came back she took no notice of the selection change.

Since she was talking with her friend while sewing, she was distracted. And since she was distracted, she had done a full length and a full width and only during her second pivot(turn) noticed that something was off. 

She had to go through the seams with a seam ripper and rip out every other stitch so that she could rip it out and redo the line. Those stitches were in there to stay, and it took her a good 5 minutes to get them all out and then redo it.

""Hey, sorry to bother you.  But I just overheard that guy in the red shirt (pointing at my friend who was across the gym) saying some extremely crass stuff about you in the locker room.  It was really sexual and graphic, basically talking about ripping off your purple spandex and violating you in front of everyone.  I couldn't just listen and not tell you because you deserve to know what certain people are really like.""

Listing to this I was furious.  This guy had obviously seen my friend and the girl talking in the gym (*she* approached *him*) and gotten jealous because he wanted to get with her.  So he made up this lie to throw him under the bus.  I know it was a lie because 1) I was just in the locker room and nothing of the sort was said and 2) the dude he was lying about was actually a really nice, respectful guy.

So he finished up his tall tale and before the girl could respond I scoffed really loud and said:

""She knows you're lying just to try to get in her pants.  That guy would never say those kinds of things about her because *she's his sister*, you moron.""

The look on LT's face was priceless.  He went pale and stammered something about how he must have gotten the guy mixed up.  But the girl (who had caught on and was playing along) pointed out how he had been very clear about pointing her ""brother"" out.  So LT shifted his story again and said he must have gotten the girl he was talking about mixed up.  So I pointed out that she was the only girl wearing purple spandex.  

He actually looked like he was about to cry, and I never saw him in the gym again after that.

This proved to be a bit of a curse as I'd often return home to find people had parked in our space. It was never any individual consistently, it was generally one-off visitors, so there was very little I could do to stop this. I took to blocking them in, so they'd have to buzz the intercom up to my flat and sheepishly ask me to let them out. I'd have some fun with this, and over time I developed some great passive-aggressive sarcastic responses to annoy them. All of the residents spaces in the car park are very obviously marked with the flat numbers, so anyone parking there knows exactly what they're doing, and are simply being both lazy and ignorant.

But onto the petty revenge. I'd returned home from a long day to find an estate agent's (realtor) car in my space. When I got up to my flat, the door to the vacant flat next to mine was open, and there were voices coming from inside. I popped in, to find the estate agent standing in the corridor. I politely told him he was in my space, and could he kindly move his car so that I can park. His response was a rather brash and dismissive ""Yeah I'm a bit busy here mate, I'll come and move it when I'm done, yeah?""

The couple looking round the flat then emerged from the lounge, and were obviously surprised to see me, some randomer, standing in the flat.

Me: Oh sorry guys, I live next door, I just popped in to check up as the door was open.

Them: Ah nice to meet our potential new neighbor - so tell me, what's it like to live around here?

Me (now staring straight at the estate agent): Well, we won't be here much longer, the freight trains that run by at 2am every night are killing me, there's a power cut at least a couple of times a month, and now that my GF doesn't feel safe round here after those news reports about the park opposite, we'll probably be gone before you guys move in.

To try to fix this (and help with the whole getting a job thing) I went to meetups. At one of them, we were working on projects, and by the door was a coat rack. So I hung up my zippered-pocket jacket and got to work. I keep my bus pass in my phone case, but since for the project I needed it off, I decided to put it in my jacket. I wrapped it up in receipts, and zipped it up into my jacket pocket.

Come time to leave, and the card is no longer there, and my pocket is unzipped. The receipts are though, but they aren't in the shape of the card anymore so someone clearly stole my card. I am forced to, in the middle of a strange place, navigate home while suffering anxiety attacks and needing to pay money I don't have for a new bus pass.

Fast forward to now, and I finally get around to adding my new bus pass to my online account, and I see that my old one has been in use. Regularly filled up with money even.

So every day, I check on that old bus pass's balance. Until one day, it reaches $86. A $5 payment, and it's reported lost and the card is blocked, a new one with the balance to come in the mail.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4siyi9/fucker_left_me_stranded/,pettyrevenge,186,

2016-07-11 15:21:29+00:00,2884,Never contribute to the pot luck but always grabbing a plate?,amandahugingkiss,"This happened approximately 20 years ago.

One summer while I was in college I volunteered for a small laboratory. The lab had 8-10 regular employees, 1 pathologist and 1 lab director. The pathologist was Jewish and the lab director was Muslim.

Near the end of the summer before I was leaving them to go back to school they threw a potluck lunch and put up a sign-up sheet for it.

The potluck came and everything was delicious. About 30 minutes into it the director walks in and eyes everything up. ""Does this have pork in it?' he asked pointing to the lasagna?

'Yes' was the reply.

'This?' he asks pointing to greens.

'Oh yes, I cook those with bacon fat'

I suddenly realize that every dish included pork of some sort. green beans with ham, meatballs with pork, mac and cheese with bacon, etc.

The lab director slowly realizes this as well and walks out defeated.

Once he was out of ear shot the entire room starts laughing, and it was explained to me that every time they have a potluck that the director and pathologist NEVER brought anything, ALWAYS took a plate of food, and ALWAYS took it back to their office rather than eating with the group, which i think offended them the most. So they plotted together to only bring in dishes that included swine.

Soon after that the pathologist walked in to the same pork-laden options and left without any food as well. It was hard to keep a straight face now knowing what was happening.

2016-07-07 23:50:10+00:00,2776,Neighborly pretty revenge.,PM_ME_UR_DARKSECRET,"Our neighbors and I share a common fence, though it's entirely on our property. It was wire and old, offering no privacy between us. Now, we have a pretty good relationship, but sometimes I just want to garden without their kids bugging me.

For some reason, the other sides of their yard and our yard have wooden fences of different designs. When we got together to discuss the fence, we decided to build the fence with their wooden design since it would be cheaper by $500. Also, the husband is a little OCD and wants a perfect backyard whereas we don't care that much. We were going to go in halfsies with them, but it still would cost $2,000 a piece.

The company had time to set the posts, but had other jobs to complete said they would come back in a few months. Not a big deal since we could keep the wire fence up. The night the posts were set, our neighbors approached us sheepishly and admitted they could not afford their half at all. They had a sob story which we accepted and let them know not to worry about it. We could cover another $2,000. 

About two weeks ago, we noticed our neighbors meeting with a construction crew. I asked the wife what was going on and she excitedly explained how they were building a new patio with outdoor kitchen and pergola. I said it was convenient they had the money for this, but not the fence and she just shrugged and said since the fence was on our property, it was our responsibility.

I went into my house, called up the fence company (who were coming by in a few days) and said we had changed our minds about the fence design. We were happy to pay the extra $500 to match our current fence. 

The fence was finished and it looks great. Within hours the husband was knocking on our door asking why we had changed the design. I said that while we were getting the cash together, we found an extra $500 for the more decorative design. I said since the fence was our responsibility, we wanted to make it look the best. He was *pissed* and left quickly. I didn't even get a chance to tell him we are getting the entire fence stained dark grey next week. It might clash with his red cedar, but after all...it's our fence and needs protection from the elements.

2016-07-06 17:17:43+00:00,5812,So I got fired from my job..,SgtSlaughterEX,"I had two jobs, one was at this country ice house in buttfuck nowhere outside of my city. This place was pretty small, but was one of the few bars in a certain area so it would get busy. A lot off good ol' boys and oil field guys. 

I worked the door, checked ids and such, and usually broke up fights or kick people out. The owner of this place was very ""hands on"". He liked to micromanage everything. Didn't want me to kick people out unless they were throwing punches, and even then to try and talk to them. Never cut anyone off. Had that ""always be selling"" attitude.

One night some trouble happens between some regulars and one guy tries to hit another guy with a pool stick. I happened to get hit in the arm but got behind the guy and put him to sleep. 

Next day the manager calls me to tell me I'm being let go. Apparently pool stick guy spends a lot of money and me putting him to sleep left him bitter so he called the owner. 

That's fine.

Anyways the bar has a nice fancy jukebox. If you have the app you can just pick songs on your credit card and they'll play. If you hit play next on a song, even if they turn the jukebox off, it'll play when it starts back up. It's also unskippable. 

With the master remote you could skip a song but they lost that remote so they really can't do much if someone plays a certain song they don't like, and even if they unplug it, it'll play no matter what when they turn it on.

Here's my petty revenge:

The owner does inventory every tuesday night. It also happens to be a busy night because they do pool tournaments and it usually gets packed.

So here I thought, I could probably just play the same song over and over and there's nothing they can really do. 

I got twenty bucks in credits and that usually gives you about 18 unskippable songs. Plus more depending if the app gifts you credits. 

I picked a remix of Cotton Eye Joe, that comes in at around 7 minutes a pop. Usually when the pool tournament started.

Two hours of hearing the same song has killed their business on tuesdays. Even if they unplug it, it'll still play when they plugged it back up.

I've been doing it for two months so far, last I heard they had to buy a new jukebox at a cost 5,000. I'll probably stop for a month then start again. I'm an asshole I guess.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4rjl8i/so_i_got_fired_from_my_job/,pettyrevenge,550,
2016-07-06 03:15:31+00:00,2422,Jerk coworker is rude to an old lady because he wants to leave early.... I make him stay late.,Delanium,"When I was 16 I worked at a bakery/cafe, specifically in the bakery section.  I sold pastries and made the drinks, and other people manned the actual sandwich/soup/salad area.  We all worked very well together, had good managers, and had our lunch rush or closing cleanup routine down.

Then there was him.  I'll call him AA, because he had a name that started with A and was also an asshole.  And he probably could've used AA.  At his interview he put on a very professional front, and seemed to me at first to be a pretty nice guy.  I noticed his asshole-ness slower than others, because I worked in the bakery and he was on line.  But here are a list of his crimes:

~Not wearing gloves
~Not changing gloves when he should have
~Smoking in the cafe
~Snapping at customers (even the nice ones)
~Lying to customers
~Hitting on the 16/17 year old employees (he was about 23), which included me
~Generally saying dickish things

It's been too long for me to give any actual quotes except for this gem.  ""You know that soda'll kill you"" AA tells me as he takes a drag from his cigarette.

And somehow the managers NEVER saw any of his bad behavior.

Now after he worked there about three weeks, he was on a closing shift with me.  It's looking to be pretty standard.  I close down the bakery, in my lonely isolated bakery bubble, while two people close down the food line and one person cleans the dining room.  

About five minutes before closing, a nice elderly lady comes in wanting to order a salad.  She wants it for here-- that's not a problem.  The only thing we can't do while she's in the cafe is mop or vaccuum the dining room, which we don't do until the last twenty minutes of closing anyway.  And she's alone, ordering half a salad, and sure to eat quick.  Just as I'm about to finish her order, AA pops up behind my shoulder.

AA: ""Oh, ma'am, you can't order in, we're closed.""

Me: ""We're not closed yet, it's fine.""

AA: ""We can't start cleaning until she leaves.""

Me, holding back an eye roll: ""Yes we can, we just can't vaccuum--""

AA proceeds to pressure this little old lady into taking her order to go, when she would clearly like her salad now.  I awkwardly apologize as we finish the order, and I give her a free pastry since we're closing anyway.  (They get donated, not thrown away, btw)

When the nice old lady leaves, I fix AA with a death stare.  He shrugs and asks ""What?  Don't you wanna go home early?""  I was seriously mad.  I remembered his hitting on me, his lying to a customer (which is a story for another day), and his general dickishness.  I say simply ""You're an asshole"" and turn to my closing duties.  AA does the general douchey ""Oooooooooh"" but doesn't press further.

The hour passes.  The cafe is clean.  I look over at the other line worker doing her last cleaning of the appliances.  I look at the wetspots from the mop on the floor, drying.  I wish that I could somehow make AA stay longer.  And then it hits me.  The new manager is on tonight.

Oh, that new manager.  That new manager who does everything by the book and doesn't care about staying late.  That new manager who does the closing thing that no other manager does-- make us scrub the floor before we mop it.  It takes 15 minutes, not counting the sweeping and mopping.

I look at the other line worker, whose duties don't include the floor.  She can go home.  The dining room worker is done.  I'm done.  The manager has been in the office counting the day's profits.  He doesn't know if we've mopped.  

I grab a slice of bread from the donation bag.  I step over to the now-dry floor of line.  I crumple the bread and let it fall.  I step on it a few times to make it look like it's been there a while.  I grab a slice of lettuce.  I grab a bit of onion.  I grab a crouton and crush it.  All while keeping the counters and appliances absolutely pristine.

I step back to my bakery and start putting out the clean trays and labels for the morning shifters.  Then I hear the manager's voice.  ""(other line worker), you're good.  (Dining room worker), you're good.  AA-- Did you do the floors?""

AA: ""Yeah, of course.""

Manager: ""Why don't you take a closer look.""

I can't look, I'll give myself away.  I hear AA spluttering.  Manager: ""Clean the floors, then you can go.""

AA is still spluttering.  ""I-- can I just sweep?""

Manager: ""Seriously?  No.  Sweep, scrub, mop.  Then you can go home.""

My heart is pounding as I hear the manager approach me.  I've just finish putting the labels in the correct places.  ""Delanium, looks good.  You can go home.""

16 year old me couldn't believe I'd gotten away with it.  I smiled at the manager, clocked out, and asked about last night's episode of a show.  We chatted for a few minutes and I watched out the corner of my eye as AA scrubbed the floors, looking utterly defeated.  I left before he was finished.

Tl;dr: My coworker was a first class douche, and when he pressured an old lady into ordering out so he could leave early, I sabotaged his closing so he could stay late.

Edit: I've been on Reddit about four days, and this seriously makes me feel good.  I made my own front page, lol.  And for anyone who is curious, AA was ultimately fired for sexual harassment and banned from all chains of the cafe, or from any restaraunts affiliated with the parent company.

Edit: Given a few comments, I feel the need to say that the old lady ordering 5 minutes before closing was not an inconvenience.  She wanted half a sald-- that takes 90 seconds to make and 5-20 minutes to eat.  She would not have inconvenienced us unless she sat there for 45 minutes eating her salad.  AA was out of line.

The cashier, a teen aged girl, I could tell was working as best as she could. The process was a tad slower however, because she had a stutter, and a bit of a lisp.

As she worked through the line, asking the usual questions probably mandated by the big wigs (I've worked in retail, it's a thing), the man behind me began to huff and puff. He muttered something about having places to go, he was in a hurry, etc. I ignored him, until I heard him start to mock her to his kids.

The kids began to laugh. It really made my blood boil. Especially since I could tell the cashier heard his mockery. That **really** made my blood boil. When a person doesn't respect retail employees as people, it's the best way to tell whether a person is an asshat or not.

So, when it was my turn at the register, she asked me in a small voice ""Are you a member o-o-of the rew-w-rewards club?"" And I looked smugly at the guy behind me, and back at her.

&gt;Me: The rewards club? Oooo that sounds great! Please explain it to me? 

She seemed surprised at first, but then looked at the guy behind me, and then it clicked.

I have never given my information so slowly in my life. Never had I asked as many questions as I did. She smiled and answered my inquiries, while the guy behind me was seething.

&gt;Him: Can you hurry up, **please?**

&gt;Me: And miss out on these great rewards? *As if!*

I only held him up for about 5 minutes... but wooo child, it felt so good.

2016-06-28 14:56:13+00:00,3682,The laziest hostess,ImAgInE78,"So yesterday was my real life cake day and I wanted to go out to eat with my daughter. Our first choice of restaurant was closed on Mondays, no big deal we'll go down the street and just have dinner at the local pizza place. 
Once inside we were seated by the hostess and given menus and water. I'm looking around the restaurant and it's fairly busy with just one server running around. No help at all from the hostess once she puts someone at a table, as a matter of fact she goes and sits down at a table herself and starts playing on her phone and talking with her friends. Now up until 2 years ago I had been a server for almost 15 years, so I know how to observe what is happening in a restaurant. I stopped my (the only) waitress and asked her if she ever got help and she said no, that girl never helped out.
So my petty revenge on behalf of the server was to call the restaurant every time that hostess sat down and pulled out her phone. I'd wait for her to get up, walk across the floor and pick up before I hung up. After a few times she was getting visibly upset and I could see her talking about it with her friends. I told my server before we left and she loved it. Thanked me profusely and even got me extra dessert to go.

EDIT: To everyone hating on me for ""ruining"" this teenage girl. My issue was with her sitting down in the middle of a semi full restaurant and playing on her phone. I fully realize she may not be expected to run food or anything. However, I know the management and know for a fact that she should have been helping more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4q9tve/the_laziest_hostess/,pettyrevenge,504,
2016-06-27 13:15:28+00:00,2740,Don't shove me into a locker and expect to get away with it.,hydroto,"The cause of this story started in 6th grade. I was goofing off with a friend of mine in the hallway after school. I punched his arm after he made a jab at my mom. The class bully, who I'll call Justin, was a pudgy, self-absorbed twerp. Justin saw the punch and wanted to get in on the action. Being the colon-pirate he was, he came up behind me, grabbed my head, and slammed it into a locker. One of the teachers saw this, thought we were fighting, and sent us to the office. We both promptly got in-school suspension for three days (you sit in a room in silence and get handed your homework).

For two years I sought after a way to get back at him. I was finally presented with the opportunity in 8th grade History. Justin and I were both out of class on a test day. When we got back the following day, we were sent to the library to make it up. He, thinking we're buddy-buddy, sat next to me and told the librarian we were allowed to work on it together. I was initially hesitant, but agreed. I knew 95% of the answers, but purposefully answered more than half of them incorrectly. After we finished, I told him to go back to class first so it didn't look like we were working together. As soon as he left, I went back and changed my answers. 

When we got our test grades back, he glared at me for the entire class period. Of course, he couldn't say anything to the teacher about the answer-sharing, so he just had to suck it up and take the failure.

This is still one of my proudest moments to-date.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4q39j4/dont_shove_me_into_a_locker_and_expect_to_get/,pettyrevenge,127,
2016-06-22 15:11:08+00:00,3294,Simply Petty,poop_squirrel,"This just happened about 20 minutes ago.

My husband and I are students at a local community college.  This semester it just so happened that our class schedules match perfectly, so we are able to carpool.

After class today we met up and began walking to our car in the second lot (we found EXCELLENT parking today!), and we went to cross the crosswalk, as the only car travelling through the lot was WAY at the other end, having just turned in.  We should have had plenty of time to cross, but the car suddenly accelerated at an alarming rate half way through the parking lot and barely came to a screeching halt before hitting me (we're talking inches, people).  

My husband was understandably pissed off, but at my insistence he decided not to confront the guy, even though the guy was yelling out the window as though it was our fault that he nearly hit me.  Instead, the opportunity for petty revenge presented itself.

Remember that excellent parking space we had?  Well, it turns out that Douchebag McAsshole wanted it.  So we took our sweet time.  Instead of throwing our bags in the back seat, we gently placed them in the trunk of my car.  My husband decided to do a once-around inspection, to check for any tires with low air and scratch marks.  Then I realized that I had dropped my headphones from my purse when we placed our bags in the trunk.  Oops!  They were in my purse the whole time.  Silly me!

Mr. McAsshole was getting furious at this point, still yelling at us out his window.  New classes were starting soon, and if he didn't get into this spot soon, he'd be late, and all of the other spots in the lot were being filled!

When we were finally satisfied that everything was in order for us to leave, another car came from the other direction, hoping in vain  to catch our spot.  So my husband (who was driving) pulled slowly out of our spot in such a way that it blocked Mr. McAsshole from entry (backing out at an odd angle toward him), allowing the sweet young girl in the other car to enter.

2016-06-21 15:06:00+00:00,2377,My petty revenge turned full blown evil,4lips2gloss,"This was 15 years ago now. My brother (Jack) and I are 1.5 years apart. I was always the goofy, annoying ugly older sister and he was the cool, good looking, funny younger brother in school. Obviously there was rivalry.

My brother would do anything he could to get on my nerves. One day he took it too far, and while I was tying his laces he kicked me in the teeth, caused the front one to fall out and me being even more embarrassed at school. My mum chalked it up to an ""accident"". He was also regularly sneaking into my room to pee on my floor, something my mum also didn't believe until she caught him, but he suffered no punishment.

About one week later, I laid in bed. Waiting. Once the clock hit quarter past midnight I crept out onto the landing with a black biro and sketched into the wall ""Jack is the best"". I'd been practising his handwriting, formulating this plan for the past week. It looked absolutely perfect. Added to this, the walls had been freshly painted.

In the morning I went downstairs to make my cereal and as I was coming up I see my brother in tears while my parents shout at him, telling him he's always getting into trouble and this was the last straw. He was grounded for a year and for 6 months even his friends weren't allowed over.

2016-06-19 05:45:04+00:00,3278,I orchestrated a situation where my bully had to listen to 20 people tell her she was garbage to her face while she was unable to say anything back.,everytownhasanelmst,"One day in high school I was scrolling through my tumblr dashboard when I see something that looks familiar and do a double take... It was a piece of artwork that I drew. A piece of artwork that I never posted to the internet or even took a picture of. I was thoroughly freaked out. 

A friend of mine reblogged the picture from the original poster, which is how it ended up on my dashboard. The original poster and her cronies were all talking shit about it. They called it ""atrocious"" and that it looked like ""a kid scribbled it with crayons."" So then I was thoroughly freaked out and really humiliated. 

After some sleuthing I discovered that I knew the original poster and her posse. Sarah, the ringleader, and her cronies were all in my AP Art class. I've always had this thing about not stooping down to their level/being the bigger person, so I left the nicest and most civil message in her inbox I possibly could. Something like ""Hey Sarah, so I don't know if you know, but I'm the person who made that drawing. It makes me really uncomfortable that you're making fun of it on the internet so I would appreciate it if you stopped :).""

She didn't reply, but the post was deleted impressively fast.

Sarah was in two of my classes and I didn't want things to be awkward, so I took the kill-her-with-kindess approach. I never mentioned what happened, but every chance I got I went up to her like ""Hey Sarah! We never talk, why is that? How's it going? Thinking about college?"" It made her EXTREMELY uncomfortable. She would sweat, squirm, and stutter--constantly waiting for me to call her out. But I never did.

A couple weeks later my hippie AP Art teacher wanted to spend a class just asking us questions and talking about our feelings. We were only allowed to speak when holding a stuffed bunny that the students were to pass around. The questions were mostly about how choosing art as a career path had affected our lives. 

Finally, our teacher asked something like, ""has anyone ever had someone react negatively to your artwork?"" I shot my hand up lightning fast and someone passed the bunny to me. 

I told my whole class the story I just told you. I didn't use anyones name, but a loud-mouthed friend of mine revealed the perpetrators were sitting in the class with us. 

The whole ""only speak when you're holding the bunny"" rule went out the window pretty quickly. Everyone was pretty disgusted with this mystery group's actions and did not keep it to themselves. 

Sarah and the others tried to defend themselves once or twice, but there was no way they could justify what the perpetrators did without identifying themselves as said perpetrators. All of their sentences awkwardly trailed off. Sarah just had to sit there and listen as everyone, even the teacher, shamed her to her face. 

I mean, seriously, *who takes a picture of something someone made and posts it publicly on the internet without their permission, just for the sole purpose of tearing it town with their friends?*

Fucking Sarah does.

2016-06-13 07:21:16+00:00,2299,Delicious revenge against the neighbourhood brats.,MissPlant,"I recently moved to a small city for work and the first place I lived was amazing, nice quiet area, large house, friendly neighbours in general. I really lucked out.
  
That is, however, until the two hellspawn from the house next door made themselves known to me. Let it be known that I don't like children that much to begin with, but if they're polite and well behaved then there are no problems. These two kids were not, and could often be heard whining and screaming loudly in the street, often as late as eleven at night because their parents apparently did not give a fuck. Now this I could tolerate, my house is well soundproofed with the windows closed. 
  
My house had a driveway which I did not use at all because I don’t yet own a car. These little shitnuggets would use it to play football/soccer, and if that wasn’t bad enough they would directly aim for the windows of the house. On more than one occasion I had to run out, fearing a broken window, and tell them to get lost. They would run away laughing and would return again shortly after when I wasn’t looking.  
  
So one day I happened to be sitting outside my house reading a book and enjoying a rare patch of sunny weather. The kids were also outside giving me stink eye because they couldn’t play in front of my house. This alone would have been satisfying revenge for me, but it gets better. An ice cream van likes to travel around that neighbourhood and as soon as the tell-tale music started playing these kids ran to their mother demanding money for frozen treats. Mummy said “no” very firmly and these kids started screaming and wailing like banshees, with stamping of feet and crocodile tears. Thoroughly entertaining stuff.  
  
Seeing an opportunity I went to the ice cream van. I bought two large ice creams with sprinkles, turned towards the kids and smiled at the hope in their young faces. Then I turned back to my house and ate every last bit of those two cones with a great big smile on my face. The crying of those two brats only made it more delicious.

2016-06-01 14:46:14+00:00,2541,Friend's mom loses it on me for using her decorative soaps. I get revenge by stinking the place up a bit.,still-improving,"As a kid growing up, I had never encountered the concept of ""decorative"" soaps and towels. To me, soap was for cleaning up, towels were for drying hands. I had never encountered towels and soap that weren't supposed to be used. The idea had never occurred to me.

When I was 9 I was over at a friend's place hanging out. After using the washroom at my buddy's house, I proceeded to wash my hands with delicate decorative seashell soap and then dry them with decorative towels.

I go back to the rec room to continue playing Monopoly with my friends. About half an hour later we hear a shriek coming from upstairs. We looked at each other in shock, then my buddy's mom came rushing down the stairs, clutching several small decorative soaps in her hand, and screaming, ""Who the hell used my soap?!?""

I was in shock, I admit. I didn't answer, because I was stunned as I tried to process this scene. I mean, she was acting like I pissed in her fridge, but all I had done was wash my hands after a pee. *Aren't you supposed to do that?* I wondered? *Isn't that what soap is **for**?*

Meanwhile, AngryMom is yelling at us, ""Come on, out with it, which one of you bastards did this?""

Meekly I reply, ""I did, why, was I wrong?""

""These soaps are for decoration ONLY,"" she yelled. ""What kind of ignorant bastard would ruin my decorative soaps?!""

I started to reply, to try and defend myself from - what I considered - the ludicrous charge of using soap. I tried to explain that I had never seen or heard of soap not meant to be used, but she immediately interrupted.

""Well, I don't know what kind of mother you must have to be so ignorant!"" and went storming back upstairs, audibly muttering about what a bad kid I was and how my mother was a bad mother.

I was mortified and embarrassed, as was my buddy. He apologized for his mom's behaviours, and said that she was nuts about her decorative soaps and towels. He said he should have warned me, and was sorry, which was nice of him.

As we chatted he started listing other things his mom was crazy about. Like raking her living room carpet. Seriously, it was a deep shag, and she had a garden rake she used only indoors, on that carpet. If you walked across the carpet you had to rake it after you because she'd lose it if there were footprints in her shag.

Turns out the the thing she loved the most was her garden. She was nuts about it, and would brag about it constantly to anyone who would listen.

After the shock and embarrassment wore off, I was pretty angry. Angry because the idea of soaps and towels you can't use is stupid. Angry because she thought it was ok to yell at me like I had just shit in her bathtub. I felt revenge was in order.

I waited about a week, during which I began to collect dog shit in a bag. We had a dog and it was my job to clean up the poo, so it wasn't a difficult task as it was a chore I was responsible for anyway. Instead of putting the poo bags in the garbage can, however, I hid them behind our shed.

Then, about 3 am one night, I snuck over to my buddies house and filled his mom's garden with dog shit. Our dog was a boxer and pretty big, so a week's worth of shit was a lot of shit. I put shit on the ground, shit in her bushes, and shit inside some of the flowers. I even lined dog shit along the window sill so when you looked out the window it looked like the shittiest shit Easter ever.

Fuck you, Mrs. Benito.

**Edit:** For those who are asking, here's how things turned out:

Unfortunately the follow up is a bit of a let down. I simply don't know how she reacted. My buddy never mentioned it, which is understandable as her hysterics embarrassed him mightily.

This morning I was helping set up for a big (25 or so people) family BBQ at my brother's house.  I had to keep excusing myself to go inside to respond to emails / texts (unexpected work related emergency).

On one of the trips inside I was on the phone in a small home-office.  My brother opened the door, walked in, farted, and then shut the door as he walked out, as is tradition.  Fortunately his farts are more bark than bite.

He knew my revenge would be forthcoming, so extra trickery was necessary.

As it turns out, most of my trips inside were to the bathroom because my insides are still processing the toxic debris from a late night last night (rare red meat, chicken, bacon and bean chili, deviled eggs, homebrew, etc.).

For about the next 30 or so minutes I held in gas until I could hold it in no longer.  I excused myself to go inside, and headed straight for a tiny, stuffy, utility closet.  I flipped the circuit breaker for the exterior power outlets (this killed the music outside), closed the door so it was just wide enough to stick in my ass, and then I trumpeted out a ten second, four-note fart.  It smelled like a combination of rotten eggs, and a skunk fucking a burning tire.  It was so spectacularly putrid that I gagged from my own fart.  

I hid in the next room as I could hear my brother coming in to reset the breaker.

Footstep…  Footstep…  Footstep…  Footstep…  Door opens…

""Uuuuh.  What the…? AAAEEEUUUGGGHH…  AAAEEEUUUGGGHH…,"" (loud gagging noises).

At this point I started cracking up, walked around the corner, and patted him on the back (he was doubled over) as I let loose a seven step walking fart.  As I walked away I said, ""Don't crop dust the master.""  But we both know that he will.

Several years ago I had an issue with this at a company I worked at (in Utah) for a very short time. It was one of those pyramid marketing style companies (tons of them there). I didn't enjoy the job but needed the money and it paid okay. They required all employees to purchase headsets for the job (answering the phone and placing orders), and the headsets cost around $60~100 for the most basic one. Everyone else paid for it like it was no big deal and it'd been going on ever since they first opened, but I searched and found out that it was against the law.

I confronted the top manager about it, first asking nicely if they could reimburse me for the cost of the headset. He replied rudely that they didn't do that, so the next day I asked again to a different manager, and showed them the law that required them to do so. That manager pretended he didn't know about that law and that it somehow didn't apply to that job. Utah law said they have to either pay for equipment, or re-purchase the used equipment from you once you leave at a fair price.

I ended up quitting that job 3 months later because they repeatedly moved my hours later and later into the late evening when I had originally signed up for a regular morning shift. I'd even threatened to quit ""within 2 weeks"" because the hours were so bad, but they kept saying HR couldn't do it and that they tried. Funnily enough the day I walked up to a manager and told him ""today's my last day"" within the very hour they came back to me saying HR magically approved fixing my hours back, but I told them it was too late and they shouldn't treat their employees like this.

After I quit I asked them once more for a refund for the headset and they denied it again. So I did what any rational, revenge-seeking employee would do - I simply submitted a report to the labor department in Utah with all of the required information on the form, waited a few weeks, then received a phone call that they had spoken with the company and fixed the problem. I got a check in the mail for the full amount of the headset, and since they didn't let me return the headset I even got to keep it (which was useless without a phone to put it into). I really hope they got some sort of fine for doing that too, but I never heard anything further. I don't know if they stopped charging employees illegally or not either.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4lm67c/make_me_pay_for_a_required_headset_how_about_you/,pettyrevenge,107,
2016-05-25 04:04:24+00:00,2552,"Sorry Mrs. Drives-Like-a-Jerk, lawyers really are allowed to fire their clients",sirthopas,"This happened about two years ago when I was working as a paralegal for a small personal injury law firm. I was on my way to work and stopped in one of two left turn lanes waiting for the light to give me the go ahead. I started to turn when the lady (hereafter referred to as Mrs. Jerk) next to me realized she was in the wrong left turn lane and cut me off to get into mine, almost making me crash into her. I barely managed to avoid slamming into her (or her slamming into me), and she pealed off, quickly accelerating past the speed limit. A few seconds later I see her ahead of me, trying to change lanes again, and crash into someone else's car.

I pull over and call the police. The poor high school girl Mrs. Jerk had hit was shaken but alright, but Mrs. Jerk was raising hell, screaming and cussing. When the police arrive, I tell them what I had seen and gave them my information. I didn't think anything else about it until six months later.

One of the paralegals at my office was incompetent and couldn't follow the simplest of directions (I will call her Bimbo). It wasn't long before Bimbo was fired. As luck would have it, I got saddled with her clients. Yay me. One of them was a super annoying woman who would call at least three times a day wanting an update on her case, demanding to know when she could expect some money for her ""debilitating injuries"", and if she could get a loan (she was apparently under the impression that we moonlighted as a bank). When we told her there was nothing new to report (because it can take a while) she would start screaming at us, telling us that ""we weren't treating her right"", and that she would fire us if we didn't get her the money she felt she was owed.

I finally got all of her medical records and bills and sent a demand package to the At Fault Party's insurance company requesting they pay X amount to our client. Now, for those of you who don't know, a personal injury lawyer will step in to represent you if someone causes an accident and hits you. We will negotiate with your insurance (UM) and the At Fault Party's insurance (Liability) to get you as much money as you need because insurance companies can be pretty scummy. But if YOU were the one to cause the accident then tough shit. Shouldn't have been driving like an asshole. Well, the At Fault Party's insurance sends back a later stating that they had never received anything from us notifying them about this accident. Bimbo had never sent them a notification letter. Therefore, they would not respond to our demand package until they had received said letter and a copy of the accident report (because bureaucracy!). So, I pull the accident report to send them a copy and what do I see but my own name listed as a witness. Confused, I quickly read through the report and realized that our client was Mrs. Jerk.

Mrs. Jerk told my boss (Mr. Lawyer) and Bimbo this sob story about how she was an innocent victim who had been hit by this wild, out of control teenager. And because neither Bimbo nor Mr. Lawyer bother to read anything until the last minute, took her at her word and stuffed the accident report into the file without bothering to look at the particulars of the case. For months I had to deal with this woman's bullshit and now I was finally free. I quickly brought up the problem with Mr. Lawyer, who quickly scheduled a meeting with her.

Mr. Lawyer kindly told her that although he wasn't able to help her, he knew the name of another lawyer who could. This lawyer was Mr. Asshole, who was - as the name implies - an asshole. For almost an entire year, Mr. Asshole would send us the most ridiculous clients he came across (my favorite was the man who insisted that his surgeon had implanted a listening device into him and wanted us to take his case, despite the fact that we did not practice medical malpractice nor any other type of law that involved the insane ramblings of smelly rednecks).

One day I had a table of two. They were the absolute worst. They sent every soda, drink, french fry, you name it back to the bar/kitchen. They would yell for me while I was clearly talking to other tables. After about 90 minutes of being the worst and spending about 65 bucks, they didnt tip me anything. They also left a huge mess on the table and a giant puddle of sprite and mango margarita on the ground. So as i'm on my hands and knees cleaning up, wonderig how much more of this shittiness I could take (i walked out about three weeks later) I noticed the girlfriend left her really nice scarf on the chair. The rags i needed to clean up the sprite/ margarita were about 4 feet away from me, and her scarf was within arms reach. So i used her scarf to dry up all the sticky puddle she had left behind. 

She came back about five minutes later, she asked if she left anything. So naturally i pretended to be dumb and eventually remembered ""oh is this your scarf. oh, i found it......in that puddle under your table. have a nice day"" and then I handed her this dirty, sopping wet scarf and continued on with my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4ktcbf/vengeful_waiter/,pettyrevenge,161,

So when me and my ex-boyfriend of 3 years were together, we'll call him Nathan, he cheated on me and slept with a girl we'll call Samantha. Samantha knew he was in a relationship with me, and after they slept together they continued to keep in constant contact via texting and often bashed me and he would vent to her about our relationship. I knew nothing of this until about 2 years in when I discovered it. I tried to make it work for another year and they cut contact, but of course it didn't work out, because he's a terrible boyfriend and such, but we decided to remain great friends. 

When we were together be had bought a wii console and split the cost down the middle. When I broke up with him he decided he got to keep the wii, whatever I didn't care.

A couple weeks after breaking up he begins dating Samantha and she moves to our town. So, the other day I was at his work (a bar) and we were discussing some furniture he was going to be buying/picking up from me. Then he says ""Oh by the way, what's the password to your Wii account? Every time me and Samantha turn on the console, your mii (a figure created in my likeness) runs up and starts hopping around and waving at us, and it's really pissing Samantha off. But, I can't delete your mii because it's password protected."" I laughed my ass off and said ""oh, sorry I just can't remember it""

How does he pay? By just dumping a handful of change into the drawer, making me pick it all up. Even if I have my hand out, he'll go under my hand and throw it in the drawer.

That pissed me off like you wouldn't believe, so I started being rude back to him. I don't give him his stuff until I pick up each coin piece by piece and then count it all out and put it in the drawer. I'm talking like $30 in quarters and dimes and nickels so it takes a good five minutes. 

One time I was doing it, he says ""Come the fuck on man, I'm in a hurry!"" I just said ""Yeah?"" and kept going while he huffed and puffed and swore and paced back and forth.

2016-05-06 23:02:57+00:00,2560,Retail revenge,Truthpaste62,"This story happened several years ago when I worked in a small town 2-man hardware store. 

One of the services we offered that you can't get at the big city box stores is window repair.  Basically, you could bring in your sash with a broken pane and we'd replace any broken parts and the glass. Total cost was the price of the glass plus $3 labor... we certainly weren't getting rich off of the deal but that type of service kept our customers happy and coming back.

One day a man who only shopped with us once or twice a year brought in a small aluminum framed window off of his storm door which had a broken glass and corner clip busted. I put his name on some masking tape and stuck it on the broken glass, told him how much it would be (I don't remember exactly but it was around $8.50), told him it would be ready the next day, and then set it on the work counter to fix when we weren't busy with customers.

About 2 weeks later he shows up for the window. I go to the back to get it, put it on the work counter, and go back to the cash register to ring it up for the total I quoted earlier. All of the sudden he starts throwing a fit saying that's way to much for a piece of glass. I explained how it's $3 labor plus the price of the glass. He then goes into a tirade about how the big box center in the city 20 miles away sells glass for a lot less and I should drop my price to meet theirs. Now I knew my competition and I knew for a fact 1) our glass was cheaper, 2) they don't cut the glass, and 3) they would never go to the trouble to repair the window, let alone do it for $3. 
 
I stand my ground with him and tell him it's $8.50. Oh hell no, he's having nothing to do with that. He wants it cheaper. Finally, I figure shit, I have lost nothing if he never came back so I walked the few steps back to the work counter, grab a hammer, and smash the glass with 5 or 6 good blows right in front of him. The glass covered the work counter which was no big deal to me, it happens all the time. I will never forget the look on his face when I handed him his frame and tell him, ""no charge."" 

He just stood there looking at me in disbelief. I thanked him for the opportunity to earn his business and told him, ""You're just going to have to go to that big box store to get it fixed now. They'll save you lots of money.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4i7l92/retail_revenge/,pettyrevenge,145,

Now, normally, I'll filter out most useless stuff that fixes itself in under ten minutes, because the local police are technically my boss's bosses, and I don't want to piss them off by calling in pointless shit. This still has me calling maybe 5-6 times a day.

That was until I found out the dispatcher that works my shift was talking shit about me and how much she hated working with me because I called ""everything"" in, keep in mind this is third shift and none of the other departments are active save mine, and that she didnt like having to deal with our calls and just ignored everything I reported any way because she felt it wasn't their job to respond to our side of things. Even though we're explicitly told not to do anything but observe and report.

That's where she fucked up. I don't care if she doesn't like me, because, whatever, I don't know her so fuck it. But her not responding to our calls when it could be dangerous to my co-workers and I, pissed me off just a bit.

I started calling *everything* in, so now I end up calling them maybe three or four times as much, since now I'm calling in every time there's a small problem and every time the problem fixes itself. And every time they haven't responded, I report that to my supervisor who reports and documents it with the police officer in charge of the area, causing more paperwork for everyone there.

2016-04-20 13:45:03+00:00,2254,Handicapped Man Gets Back at Woman,abCEEdeeznuts,"As promised, an update has been posted [HERE] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4ft744/update_handicapped_man_gets_back_at_woman/).

Warning: This is not my revenge and is only something I witnessed. 

Backstory: I take the train everyday from a suburb to the city. The train station I use is small and only has 3 trains each morning that lead to the city. They are about 1/2 hour apart and arrive at 7:00, 7:30, and 8:00. I take the 7:30 train each morning and a handicapped (able to walk but in a very slow manner with 2 canes) man takes it along with the rest of us 7:30 commuters. The train station has a very strong bottleneck where people who just parked their car file into a 3-4 ft. corridor and follow it for 50-75 ft. It basically means you have to be in a single file line leading to the train. 

So our story begins yesterday. I was walking through the corridor and see the handicapped man waiting for the train per usual. I sit down at a bench waiting for my train, pop in some headphones, and begin listening to some oldies to relax before my work day begins. Enter ""Inconsiderate Woman"" or ""IW"". She has a walk about her that just screams suburban entitled woman. You could just tell she had a way about her that was unpleasant. It's 7:28 and our train is arriving. She is standing behind the handicapped man and just seems agitated for some reason. 

The crowd begins flowing into the train and she is in a rush even though the train won't leave until everyone has entered. She is tapping her foot incessantly waiting for our double caned man to step onto the train. He drops a cane and is forced to pick it up. IW can't take it anymore and steps around him and ""accidentally?"" hits him with her giant name brand, expensive bag. He kind of side steps trying to catch himself and she walks onto the train without looking back. People around start helping him and he regains his composure and cane. We all get on and as I passed him, you could tell he was embarrassed. I felt awful. 

The rest of the day went normally and I awoke the next day to continue my routine. As I arrived to the train station and walked through the corridor at 7:20, I notice the handicapped man isn't there. 7:25, no sign. 7:28, still nothing. The train arrives and we all get on as usual, but he's nowhere to be found. I sit down and get a window seat! 

The conductor could not see them in the corridor so he began leaving the station. I look out as the train is leaving and can see through the corridor. Handicapped man has dropped one of his canes and behind him is IW absolutely livid. Red in the face, wanting to scream for the high heavens. She couldn't pass him if she tried. My first thought is that he dropped a cane on accident and will miss his train. Oh no! He stands up with both canes and smiles at all us watching through the window. I'm not sure if everyone else knew, but I did. He purposely dropped that cane and forced her to be late by at least a half hour to wherever she was going. Some may think he did it on accident, but that smile spoke to me. It was a smile of pure bliss and petty revenge. 

TLDR; Handicapped man canes a woman.

2016-04-19 17:47:34+00:00,2466,Here's your extra centimeter of soda,arbores_loqui_latine,"I work at an entertainment type place (think roller skating rink, laser tag, etc) with a cafe/grill thing located inside. I don't work at the grill but my job involves some down time, so when they're busy and I'm not, I always try to help out. 

A couple days ago we had an ENORMOUS birthday party going on. There must have been 20 kids and 20-30 adults, and almost every adult decided they wanted food from the grill. Normally we are not busy during this time so there was only one person scheduled at the grill to take orders, ring people up, *and* cook the food. Of course I rush over to help her, and another employee who wasn't busy came too. There are now three of us back here in this tiny grill area working as fast as humanly possibly and there's still a really long line. Other employee is taking orders, I'm getting drinks and delivering food, and the original lady is cooking everything as fast as she can.

Then the next guest in line comes up and orders a large Coke with no ice. Our large drinks are gigantic, I don't know for sure but I think they're 64 ounces. So with no ice she's already getting a ridiculous amount of soda. I fill it as full as I can without the foam spilling over the top and bring it over to her, and when I set it down on the counter the foam has settled so that there's about a centimeter of space to the top of the cup. She takes one look at it and goes ""um, could I get that filled *all* the way up?""

While my brain is thinking *SERIOUSLY?!* I hear myself saying ""oh of course ma'am, I'll fill that the rest of the way up for you."" So I take her cup, go back to the soda machine, and with extreme precision fill it up ALL the way to the top. It's so full that the soda is actually curving a little bit over the surface of the cup. I veeeerrry slooowly make my way back to the counter so that I don't spill a single drop and gently set the cup down in front of her with a bright ""Here you go ma'am!"" as I hand her a plastic lid. 

She had the grace to look slightly ashamed of herself and sort of mumbled ""oh, thank you"" as she tried to put the lid on, and as I turned around to get drinks for the next people in line I saw her trying to wipe off the sides of the cup with napkins as when she had put the lid on it had displaced some of the soda.

2016-04-17 15:03:51+00:00,2076,Everyone has a weakness,thehofstetter,"This morning, I was walking between terminals in the Minneapolis airport. A bunch of us got stuck behind a group of 8 teenage girls slowly walking side by side. Side by side, 8 deep! I fly over 100 times a year, but I'd never seen anything like this - a human traffic jam caused by 8 oblivious idiots. 8 obliviots.

More than two dozen people and an airport cart driving an elderly woman frustratedly walked behind them. They ignored people's polite requests of ""excuse me"", angry pleas of ""I have a flight to catch!"" and even the beeping of the cart. And this was not a mall or a park - this was an airport, where delaying someone else by even a minute can destroy their day. 

Meanwhile, they loudly gabbed about what cute boys they liked - as if sticking to script from an Archie comic. While they physically blocked the entire hallway, they were emotionally two-dimensional. 

Finally, the hall widened enough for us to walk around them. I hung back and let everyone else go ahead of me, as I had some leeway before my connecting flight. As the mess cleared, I walked by the gaggle, then stopped in front of them, turned around, and said, ""I think it's wonderful that there are still teenage girls willing to hang out with a friend who is clearly so much uglier than the rest of the group"". And then I kept walking.

I didn't even get to the end of the hall before I heard them fighting about who I meant. 

For the sake of the people on whatever flight they're eventually on, I hope they're now giving each other the silent treatment.

2016-04-15 16:15:59+00:00,2753,So I went to my old school today...,FatDwarf,"Walking up to the big glass entrance I passed a small group of three or four young boys, probably around the age of 12.

You could clearly make out the type from afar: Loud, attention deprived, the kind it's best to not even look at if you don't want to give them a chance to talk shit.

Well, sadly I didn't need to, as the alpha kid had planned to impress his fellow morons by loudly yelling at a stranger. When I ignored his first attempt of making contact he had found reason enough to move on to even cooler stuff, namely fearlessly insulting a random and obviously stronger male from 20ft away.

At this point I was considering walking right up to them and give them a piece of my mind, but decided against. After all, they would get bored quick if I don't react at all, also I was expecting to be inside the school very soon after.


Much to my dismay I found the doors had already been locked shut, with only someone from the inside being able to let me in since I didn't have a key and looking through the mostly glass front no one was in sight. So I waited, having my back towards the kids who had gone on shittalking me loudly, as to make sure I wouldn't miss any of their intellectual artistry. It became obvious they where also waiting to get inside.

After about two or three minutes I finally saw someone walk past the door and signaled to him that I wanted to come inside. Although he didn't seem too pleased with his newfound divine purpose, he reluctantly walked over and opened the door.

I went inside, turned around and saw the alpha kid running towards me shouting ""hey, guy!"", hoping to finally get to go inside aswell. I looked over to the open door, which basically closes in slow motion if left to itself, smiled at the boy, grabbed the handle and shut it.

Keeping that big smile on my face I headed towards my destination, now accompanied by the beautiful sound of muffled curses from a boy who had it coming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4exg1i/so_i_went_to_my_old_school_today/,pettyrevenge,82,

If you can't find a spot, you have to park across the street a good 200 feet away. It's a pain, but generally the neighbors try to keep their cars in the guest stalls moving from day to day so they aren't hogging them. Except this one guy... he lives alone, gives everyone the stink eye if you wave hello and just comes off like an asshole. Well, he owns two vehicles... one car and one 90's pickup that isn't suped up or anything. It's just a normal truck with a faded factory paint job. This prick parks in the stall so it goes over the line and crowds out anyone trying to park next to it, he's got a super sensitive alarm that sets off a little warning beep if you fart to close to it and then you can see him yank the blinds down from his window and look out at you if he hears it. So, here's the part that makes him a total shitfuck.. If he leaves for a weekend, he takes the truck, so he moves his car into the guest stall, leaves his covered stall empty and takes off. Fuck you.

So, one day I happen to come home while he's doing the ol' switcharoo and ""his"" guest stall is empty because he's in the truck, while his car is double parked in the street. Quick as I can, I drive into the lot and jump into the guest spot. I get out of my car and look over to see him standing by his car, which he was about to put where I am. He's giving me a death glare, then drops down into his car TEARS off with a chirp of his tires and parks it waaaaay across the street and has to walk back. At this point I'm in my own apartment and I hear his door slam and his truck leaves. I give it an hour and then move my car into my designated covered stall. By the time he returns Sunday afternoon someone else has his spot, so he still can't park there. It's been 3 weeks and he still hasn't gotten the guest stall back.

I ask for o.t if needed, he simply replies if my relief is not there I'm ok for o.t. 

Well a manager who was on channel overheard the conversation and the ensuing conversation goes something like this.

Mngr: who was that!

Mngr: that was a stupid question, you do not ask the yard master stupid questions! He's busy and you are not ok for ot. Your relief is here!

Me: my relief is here and I'm not ok for ot is that correct? (Checking my watch)

Mngr: yes he's here are you even paying attention out there? I'm coming down there to discuss this further, who is this?

Me: checks watch,  23:55, b side operator off duty, out.

I turn my radio off,tie up my ticket, and leave since my ot was canceled. My relief was not there and they had to shut down my job for almost an hour until my relief came in.

Best part was conversation was recorded so they couldn't even try to discipline me.

Summary: jerk manager tries to flex authority, ends up shutting down important part of yard all because I followed his directions knowing he'd screw himself.

So one of my best friends from my freshman year of college is a bouncer at a popular bar on campus, and once in a while, if there's a concert I like, he'll set aside a few free tickets for me (as long as I let him know in advance, and usually I pay him back with drinks, food, whatever). 

My girlfriend is a major Skrillex fan (eh, whatever. I like EDM, but I don't like that ""bro-y"" kinda dubstep). It turns out a couple of her ""friends"" in class were too. So she asked me if I could get my friend to give her and her friends four tickets. I was wary, because I didn't know these chicks and they looked bitchy, but I trusted her judgment. I talked to my friend, got the tickets, and gave them to my girlfriend. 

It turns out that my girlfriend trusted these bitches too much, because she gave them the tickets to hold on to, since one of them was going to drive everyone (you could use the bus system, but this was FEBRUARY, and it was too cold to wait outside). 

Naturally, shit goes South, and my girlfriend is calling me crying a few hours before the concert, saying that the girls just ditched her and decided to bring a different friend instead. Now, I was driving home for the weekend, but as soon as I heard this, I called my dad and told him I'd be a day late. As soon as I explained the situation, he laughed, because he knew I was going to do something or the other in response. 

I called my bouncer friend an hour and a half before doors opened, once I'd reached campus again. I let him know about the situation, and since these tickets were those ""print out and scan the bar code"" kind, he just cancelled those four tickets, and actually printed out two new ones specifically for me and my girl (I picked them up myself, and he told me he'd kick my ass if I let anyone have them this time).

My girlfriend was so excited when I told her this, and we both quickly got ready (well... I quickly got ready). We showed up right as the doors were going to open, ready to hear a bass drop so sick it would make ebola seem like a cold. As we showed up, there was naturally a long as hell line, and luckily, about twenty people in front of us were those bitches.

As soon as the doors opened, they started letting people in, scanning tickets, and checking IDs. Once the bitches were getting their tickets scanned, the bouncer (my friend) saw from the error that these were the tickets that were the ones stolen. He saw me a little bit behind, and told them to wait on the side while he let in the next few people. 

After the next ten people, they start whining and complaining that they should be let in because they're going to lose good spots. He tells them there's an issue with their tickets, and once my girlfriend and I show up, they immediately shut the fuck up and their faces turned really white. He scans our tickets, says to them ""Oh look, these were the tickets you girls wanted, weren't they?"" and they just stormed out of line, pissed as hell.

As they left, I yelled ""if you want, you can just sit by the walls and feel the bass from there!"" (I was kidding, but honestly, Skrillex uses way too much bass for my taste. Holy shit, my heart was shaking during that concert.)

TL;DR some bitches tried to use my girlfriend to get free tickets out of me, so I fucked them over and enjoyed a wub wub concert (and yes, my dad had a great laugh when I went home the next day).

2016-03-27 01:06:31+00:00,2131,Be a creep and stalk me at the gym? I'll take you up on that!,[deleted],"So this actually happened something like.. Two weeks? ago, but I was just told to post this here, so I will. 

First of, I'll clarify that I'm female, and a bodybuilder. I'm almost 200 pounds by now. I'm fairly well built in other words. 

I noticed about 15 minutes in that a guy was more or less following me around the gym, always doing something that happened to be right next to where I was at the time. He also thought I didn't notice him checking me out in the mirrors. Him looking I guess I can deal with, whatever, enjoy the view I suppose. But he kept giving his buddies this... *look* and then back at me, and they just kept smiling and nodding, as if they're giving him approval or something. 

After a while I had enough, and decided to give a little back. So I started going to whatever he was trying to impress me with last time, adding some weight, and then redoing the same set he did with the extra weight. I don't even think he noticed at first... But his friends did. 

After a while of this circus of us basically walking in circles and me putting on weights on his previous machine and then outdoing him, I managed to get him back into the same one twice in a row. I swear to god he was oblivious to even that fact. Only thing was I had added almost 45 pounds to it since he was there, and done my set on it. 

He sits down, gives it a push and realizes he can't do it. He tries again, gets about an inch of lift, and then drops again. His friends burst out laughing. In an embarrassed rush he pins the weight down and continues to be his impressive self. But the damage was done, as was I, so I left. 

When I left his friends were still laughing their asses off at him. I just smiled and waved goodbye to my new gym buddy. Haven't seen him in there since. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4c3rhl/be_a_creep_and_stalk_me_at_the_gym_ill_take_you/,pettyrevenge,195,

About a week ago someone drilled a hole in the gas tank of his truck to steal his gas. (gas is down $3 so who would do that?) Needless to say, he was pretty pissed and came up with a simple - but highly effective - plan.

He grabbed an old gas can he had and filled it up with gas... And about a gallon of water and a bag of sugar. He left it in the bed of his truck and, as expected, it was stolen within a few days.

2016-03-16 08:11:10+00:00,2230,Too many crickets.,JimiBrady,"I work at a small pet store, and we sell two things in abundance: dog food and crickets. As for crickets, we sell them at twenty for $1. Now, the store is almost always busy, so we don't have time to actually count out twenty crickets. We usually eyeball it, keeping our guesstimations on the generous side. Customers dig it because they usually get a few more crickets than they asked for, and we get to save time and generate a little good will. 

One day a customer comes in and asks for one hundred large crickets. Let's call him Clyde. No problem, I tell him. As I'm gathering the crickets into the bag, I ask him about what he's feeding them to, and we get to talking about lizards, tarantulas, and other cricket-eaters. Clyde seems alright at this point - I genuinely enjoy talking about animals with the customers. 

I hand Clyde the bag of about one hundred crickets, and he takes a long look at it, turning it this way and that. He looks at me and skeptically asks if there's *really* a hundred crickets there. ""Looks like 70 or 80,"" he says. Mind you, everyone at the store is very good at guesstimating how many crickets are in a bag; we all know what 20, 50, and 100 crickets look like, and in all the time I've worked there, I've never been questioned by a customer. 

My immediate emotional response was somewhere between annoyance and wounded pride. So, I did the reasonable, logical thing: I took the bag back, and I told him I'd count every single cricket, 'cause I'll be damned if he doesn't get *exactly* one hundred crickets. 

So, I painstakingly count each cricket by dropping them one by one from the first bag into a new bag. He watches me the whole time, making comments here and there like ""unnecessary"" and ""I'm sure it was a hundred."" But nay, I tell him. ""I want to make absolutely sure that you get the crickets you paid for.""

As I count my hundredth cricket, I look at the remainder in the bag. Lo and behold, there are ten crickets leftover. A whole fifty cents! As I hand Clyde the new bag of exactly one hundred crickets and toss the rest back into the bin, I thank him for keeping me and the store honest, and assure him that I'll count his crickets every time he comes in from now on. 

Haven't seen him since. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/4amu2p/too_many_crickets/,pettyrevenge,112,
2016-03-14 19:15:55+00:00,2369,*Click.Click.Click.....*,Rios91,"Firstly, long time lurker, first post ever. 
Secondly, I'm typing this from my phone, so I apologise for any formatting issue.
Thirdly, English isn't my first language, so please bear with any spelling or grammatical errors.

Now, this happened around 3 years back, when I was in my 6th semester at university. One of the lecturers from my department (who's normally an ok guy but a douche in this story so let's call him DL) informed my section and another that he'd be taking one of our hour long free periods to make up for a lecture that was missed for reasons I can't recall. Fair enough. DL had course to cover, and missing one hour of freedom doesn't really spell the end of the world.

However, the thing was, said free period was right before our lunch break, and most students were worried that DL's lecture would cut into that, despite his assurances that it wouldn't. You see, while some students eat at the cafeteria, a significant number head to their dorms mess, which has fixed lunch timings.

So, the hour comes and goes, and DL is droning on and on, with no end in sight. Students start to complain, but the DL says no one leaves until he's done talking, or they'll be marked absent (attendance held weightage in our grade).

So, as DL starts eating away at our lunch break, I decide to use the tools at hand to exact retribution on behalf of my dorm friends. From the mid row bench in the class, I begin clicking my ballpoint pen repeatedly. The guy next to me begin, and then the guy next to him, and so on, until DL's voice was drowned out by the glorious chorus of around a 100 clicking pens. He stopped talking.

2016-03-13 18:31:59+00:00,2645,I ruined a 14 year old boy's weekend after he called me names online.,Rich-P,"Hello! 

My name's Rich and I'm an illustrator. In November of last year I started drawing 1000 monsters for charity. At the time of writing this I'm about halfway there. 

Anyway, I've been experimenting with Periscope recently, drawing live for whoever fancies watching. 

So the other night I thought I'd draw something on Periscope. It was all going well, a comedian I'm a big fan of watched for a while, things were going great. 

Then a pack of trolls arrived. 

The leader's opening gambit was 
""I'm gonna come yours and stab u mums"".
This was troubling for 2 reasons, 
1 - Periscope uses GPS to give a fairly accurate location of where I was broadcasting, (my mum doesn't live with me but I live there and I certainly didn't want to get stabbed) and 
2 - he said ""mums"" plural. Did he know something I didn't? Did I have more than one mum? And was she also in danger?

After a mercifully brief torrent of poorly spelled abuse and well worn threats they up and left as suddenly as they arrived. 
I should have thought ""Trolls eh? Whaddya gonna do?"" 
I should have risen above it all. 

I didn't though and I found it was still playing on my mind the next day. 
I remembered that my troll had rather foolishly used his actual name so I googled him. 

Eventually I found him. I say eventually but it was actually disturbingly easy to find out vast swathes of information on him by simply googling his admittedly fairly unique name. 

He looked about 14-15 years old. He looked exactly as I'd imagined. It was as if every troll there's ever been had been fed into a supercomputer and this boy was the result. 

I should have laughed it off and thought nothing more of it. 

I didn't. 

I found who I believed to be members of his family. It's like I always say, ""don't get mad, tell their mums and dads."" I picked out 2 who I gathered were probably his parents. 

I messaged them over Facebook telling them what had happened in the most grown up and rational way I could muster. I also provided screenshots of the chat log just in case they went on the offensive and accused me of making it all up. 
I read my message over once or twice and pressed send. 

About an hour later I got a message back from his dad which I've posted below. It seemed my rational and calm approach had paid off and that his little darling would be in for a right ticking off in the very near future. 

That day?
That day was a good day!
And I only had to use my AK 3 times which is a definite improvement. 

It's just a shame that I wasn't present to actually witness the almighty bollocking first hand. 

Hope all's well

Directly in front of our home, the curb is long enough to comfortably park 2 cars (if you pull all the way up to the end). My wife parks in our driveway, and I park on the curb, leaving room for anyone else who needs a spot. A couple months ago we got new neighbors who consistently park on the curb, right in the middle,  in front of our house...which effectively takes up BOTH spots. They continued to take up both spaces Even after talking to them and politely asking them to pull up so everyone could park. Last weekend I started feeding the birds again, and REALLY seeded the berm right by the curb. The next morning their car was COVERED in birdshit. They haven't parked there since. Petty, but worth it.

2016-03-11 06:24:50+00:00,2013,I waited five years to get back at you,eatonsht,"My family didn't have a lot of money, so right after I graduated from high school, I got a job waiting tables to help pay for Community College. I was lucky enough to get a job as a server at the local Houlihan's and it was pretty good money for young college kid.  In the back there were these two Mexican dishwashers who were also joking around and laughing.  They spoke very broken English, but were able to communicate.  Every time they would see me they greeted me with a Spanish sounding version of my name.  I didn't really understand it, but they always laughed and seemed genuinely happy to see me so I laughed along too.  
  
After several months working there one of the cooks working the line, who always had a front row seat to this suddenly called me over.  I remember this guy was always stoic and we weren't really friends, but we weren't on bad terms either.  I always did my job, and tried to keep as much shit from angry customers from coming back to the kitchen, which is probably why he took pity on me.  He said, ""Do you know what they are calling you?""  I shook my head no.  I had no idea.  
  
""It is a joke on your name.  It basically means take out and suck your dick.""  I thanked him profusely and after that I tried to go even more out of my way to help that guy.  At the same time a smouldering fire began to rage and burn in my heart.  I was humiliated and angry, but I didn't say anything to them.  I just smiled and played the game.  
  
I immediately enrolled in Spanish classes the next semester.  I found Spanish speaking students to hang out with.  Soon my entire group of friends was Spanish speaking.  By this time I had moved on from that restaurant and left those two dishwashers behind, but they were not forgotten.  After several more semesters I started spending my summer breaks volunteering in South America, and finally as I graduated from University with a degree in Engineering I won an internship to work in Spain only because I had become so good at speaking Spanish.  It was an amazing three months, but all good things come to an end and I had return home.  
  
After I came back home I was exhausted, but my friend forced me to go to a birthday party.  By coincidence I ended up meeting an amazing Hispanic woman there who was going to be my future wife.  Later that night we all went to a club and as we were dancing and having a good time I suddenly felt someone tapping me on the shoulder.  I turned around and standing there is Oscar, one of the dish washers.  
  
""Take out your dick and suck it!""  He said in Spanish.  
  
Without missing a beat I replied in perfect Spanish, ""Your sister already did that for me last night!""  
  
His eyes got really big and then we both burst into laughter and hugged.  The petty dream I originally had to get back at him had finally been fulfilled, but now 5 years later my heart was suddenly filled with gratitude.  I had long since realized that he had unknowingly launched me into an amazing journey where I travelled the world, met some amazing people, fell in love with a new culture and had just met my future wife.

My roommate and I have been friends since high school ten years ago, lived together for the last three. For the most part, things have been great, we get along well and both of us are easy going to not sweat any minor things. 

Lately though she's gotten very careless - I've gradually had to take over doing almost all the cleaning, dishes, etc. Plus I don't think she's bought groceries once over the last three or four months.

My first petty revenge was to stop buying groceries myself, letting the fridge gradually empty as we ate through things. I've seen her come in, open the fridge and get frustrated when there's nothing there. But it gets better! On Sunday, when there was nothing left besides milk, I ordered a pizza before she came home. I ate all I wanted and then gave the last couple slices away to a nice homeless man who's often outside our building. Then ... I brought the empty box up to our apartment and left the empty box on the stove. 

She came home shortly thereafter to the room smelling like pizza with an inviting box sitting in the kitchen. Opened it and found ... two leftover crusts! Take that!",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/48hy7s/roommate_stopped_chipping_in/,pettyrevenge,198,

The dog could run all around the yard and make it just up to, but not on, the driveway.  Unbeknownst to us, the paper boy (this was in the 1980's) would drive up to the edge of the driveway and rev his moped to tease our dog.  He'd rev and rev the engine while our dog would go nuts at the limit of his rope, up on his hind legs trying to reach out and grab a hold of him with his front paws. 
 
Anyways, one day, the rope broke so my dad went to the hardware store for a new one. The guy tells my dad, ""We don't have any 75' ropes. Only 50' or 100'."" My dad took the 100'. 
 
I just wish I could have seen the look on my dog's face the next day when the paperboy came around and woke him up with that stupid moped.  I always imagine that dog taking a second to  thank the dog gods, for the day of reckoning hath come!  Our dog charged, jumped in the air and took the kid off his bike. The kid tried to get away, but our dog bit down onto his ankle and dragged him back into the backyard.  Eventually he got away but had to call the police to get his moped back.  The dog was sitting patiently next to it.
 
We found out about it when the police came by that night to complete their report.  The next day, the kid's dad called and told us not to worry about him suing; his son was an idiot and got what he deserved (that's how we got the whole background).

Enjoy waiting 10 extra minutes while I block you in.,Hyro22,"Yesterday I was shopping at a pretty busy Walmart right after work with the gf. We were getting a few cheap bar stools for our new apartment. Self checkout was pretty packed so I went to the 10 items or less line that only had 3 people in it. I notice some commotion coming from the person in front of the old lady in front of me with the cashier. The cashier politely asked for his women in her early 40s if she can go in one of the other lines that have way more counter space for ringing things up. I felt like that was a reasonable request because her cart was so full of food and clothing I was surprised it wasn't falling out the sides.  


Well this lady flat out refused stating ""I waited my turn in line you have to ring me up or I'm complaining to your manager."" The cashier folded and started to ring up her items. Soon the small counter space was filled up and so was the bagging area but this women's cart was still half full. She complained once more scowling and saying ""Can't you hurry it up a bit? I need to beat rushour traffic so I can make dinner in time for church (Ash Wednesday was yesterday when this happened)."" The cashier then says ""this would take less time if you went to the regular lanes where they have a bagger.""   


At this point the old lady in front of me just leaves the line to go to a different line to get her bananas. My girlfriend is getting annoyed at this point and wants to switch too but I'm a pretty patient person. My girlfriend starts making passive aggressive remarks loud enough for the lady in front to hear but not to her face. Stuff along the lines of ""I hate those idiots who take hundreds of items to the express lane."" You could tell this lady heard it because she started getting flustered.  


About 5 minutes later she finally finished. After we had finished packing up our car and heading for the exit, we saw that lady putting the last of her groceries in her minivan. I decided to slow to a stop in front of her car blocking her in and turn the car off. I told my gf to be patient for a few minutes and winked that our battery had died. I hopped out of the car, popped the hood, and disconnecting the battery. This lady starts honking like crazy so I turned to her and just shrugged. She got out of her car yelling at me to move. I told her no can do the car just died and won't start up. I pretended to call a tow truck and told her she would have to wait 30 min for it to get there. This lady had a mental breakdown started cussing me out and eventually climbed back in her car. Around 10 min later the people in the car in front of her got back and started unloading their groceries. She started honking and yelling at them to hurry up. Amazingly this just made them go slower. They eventually finished and pulled out and the rude lady was free to go. I reconnected the battery after she left and laughed about it with my gf all the way home.

(Fast food revenge),richhomiekarma,"So I use to work at a fast food place and nothing will make you lose faith in humanity faster than that or a retail job. Anyways... I am working the drive thru window where you hand the people their shit, wave em off, and on to the next one - I also have to make the customer's drinks. We, like most places, have an automated soda fountain that, with the press of a button, fills the cup with soda. It's very helpful being able to fill up 5 different cups of ice and watch them all fill up simultaneously... pretty satisfying too. 

Now to the story. Next car pulls up, its a dad and his daughter. I hand pops his drinks and he's looking at them oddly. After I hand off the sodas he says to me, annoyed, ""could you bother filling these up all the way, buddy?"" The drinks fill up automatically, and ever single time, not even a half inch below from the brim of the cup for a couple of reasons. 1.) So when you put the straw in soda doesn't spurt out, 2.) So when I put the lid on your drink, soda doesn't come out the sides ... but nope. This guy really acted like I was stiffing him here.

What do I do? I give my fakest smile and ""wow, okay sorry about that!"" ever, and proceed to fill up his sodas to the brim, to the point where the soda is over the brim, barely clinging together from overflowing. Then I put the lids on - of course soda comes out - and the lids are distorted, looking like they're about to burst from the pressure of the soda they are still retaining within the cup. I made sure to wipe of the sides of the cups. I then hand him the drinks. ""Here you go, bud."" He felt accomplished but when I said that I noticed he knew he might have overreacted I think. Not sure, meh. He then goes to put his straw in. Soda shoots out the straw opening, out from the lids sides, and all over his cup holder and car. I had handed off his food to him already so it was pretty glorious watching him fumble around in his bag for napkins while his embarrassed high school daughter bitched him out for asking for more soda. He could have asked for more napkins too as I stared at him - I never closed the window, but he didn't. He did what he needed to do - never look at me again and leave.

Our Homeowners association (HOA) restrictions say that sports team flags can only be flown on a day in which the team is playing. My intention was to only fly it on Saturdays when the football team was playing.  So I put the flag up on a Saturday the Dawgs were playing but forgot to take it down until Monday. On Friday I get a letter from the HOA stating that I am in violation of the restriction and could be fined. Okay, fair enough, they are correct on this one. I then noticed that the date of observation was on Wednesday. I called and said that couldn't be true because I took it down on Monday. Instead of admitting her mistake, she lied and said that she had seen it up on Wednesday. Now I was mad.

I've noticed a lot of the time, the worst ones are suburban soccer moms with spoiled little kids. They would always do dumb shit like if they wanted half a pound (.50) and it came as .51, they'd ask for a discount or outright flip shit.

I've been at my job long enough to essentially sense these people come in, and when I do, the game begins.

My deli offers free samples on anything the customer wants, and me being a good guy, make sure people are aware of that. Well it turns out, 90% of soccer moms actually do not want free samples for their kids, so I make a strong point of asking the child directly if they want free meat/cheese/salad, to which, 99% of the time, the answer is yes.

This starts an argument between spoiled kids and snobby parents, and they usually leave my counter, and don't return.

Enjoy the judging stares, bitch.",DarknessPrincess,"On the way home from visiting a friend me and my blind friend had to get on a bus. Since we both have the right to sit in the priority seats, my friend because she's blind and me because I had knee surgery a while back, we of course sat in them, but mostly since they were the only free seats were we could sit next to each other and chat.

After a while some bitch got on the bus and immediately tried to force us out of the seats. Now, I kept my crutch between me and my friend so it wasn't visible, and you obviously can't see that my friend is blind, so the bitch started sceaming at us because she just saw two normal teens hogging the priority seats.

Bitch: ''What the hell are you two sitting here for? I'm pregnant so I have the right to sit here!''

She didn't even show, and I looked around to spot another seat right by the exit door in the middle of the bus.

Me: ''My friend and I have the right to sit here, and there is still an open seat a bit further back you can sit on.''

Bitch: ''I demand to sit here!''

I really hate being ordered around, and I would have had absolutely no problem with moving if she had asked politely. But since she decided to be an obnoxious bitch from the start, and made my friend feel really uncomfortable with the screaming, I decided to make her feel most and utterly embarrassed. I get out my crutch from between me and my friend and hold it out to her.

Me: ''Can you please hold it so I can help my blind friend move? And please don't drop it. It's hard to bend down after my knee surgery.''

The bitch stares at us for a while, and since I spoke very loudly many people are now staring at the bitch. She then slowly shuffles to the seat in the middle, people giving her glares since she tried to force us out of the seats.

The rest of the ride went on in silence, and two nice people helped me and my friend off the bus, giving us a ''nice job'' before they went back on the bus.

The boys can't be more than 8, and like most kids, they like to play in the back yard. Which is totally fine, doesn't bother me at all. They're kids and like to run around. 
What bothers me though is that they love to throw their toys over into my yard. Alot of toys. Action figures, balls, frisbees, rackets, etc. Them throwing them over don't even really bother me that much. What bothers me is that the parents keep demanding that we have to throw them back. 
They don't ask, they don't knock on the door and apologize, they just yell over there fence when they know that we are outside and TELL us to give it back. And that bothers me. They also seem to encourage their kids to throw it over to our yard.  
So after Christmas I was at the store and saw that they had a ton of  Barbie's, nail polish, Bratz doll frisbees, and balls on the clearance. I bought 5 of everything I could find that I knew my neighbors would hate seeing their sons play with. 
Every time an action figure gets thrown over to my yard, I will throw a barbie back with it. Every time a ball gets thrown, a Bratz ball will be returned. I already threw a couple nail polishes over and the twins went crazy. They loved it. They've had pink, purple, and green nails all week.  
It's been 2 days and not a single action figure has crossed my fence. More importantly, not a single rude demand from the parents to return them.

Well the past 2 days he started doing it again along with using my tooth paste and not even fucking being kind enough to put the cap back on after using it.

So I confronted him about this AGAIN and he said ""Whatever I don't give a shit, hide it somewhere then"". Nah... nah I will keep it there, I have an idea.

A couple days ago he said he has a girl coming over and would like to get some action and leave him alone. I said OK no worries. So about an hour before she came over I pretended to leave and said I am heading out for the night. 5 minutes later I snuck back in while he was making dinner for the both of them.

I got to my room and hid in there knowing that for a fact at some point in the night she would ask to use the bathroom, and I needed to take a shit. So 45 minutes goes by and she arrived and I am just waiting. About 2 hours after she gets there I hear him go take a piss. AH perfect! he went first!

Now time to take a big fat fucking shit. I run into the bathroom and crap as quiet as I possibly can. A huge load. And I don't flush or put the lid down.
I go back to my room and wait. I stare at the clock and sit there giggling like Quagmire, exactly 28 minutes go by and whoooop There she goes, into the bathroom.

I am from Scotland and have been living in the US since Christmas day 2013. 

In 2011 I met my wife when I was working in London.  She is from Houston, Texas and was sent over to work for the London office of our company.  We got married in 2012 and due to the company we work for closing down, we move back over to Austin, Texas where she was living for 20 years before London. 

With her being from Texas you can imagine that some of her family are extremely conservative.  Which I frankly don't care if they are or not.  However, doesn't matter if you are a Conservative, liberal, socialist if you are a cunt then you can go fuck yourself.

We are sitting in the living room watching TV after an amazing thanksgiving dinner.  Someone mentioned the whole new open carry law starting this new year in Texas.  Being from Scotland where guns are a no no they ask me ""what do you think of that law, uberhaqer. Being from a place with no guns""

""It's kinda foreign to me. Not sure how I would react seeing a holstered gun in plain view. Honestly think I would feel uncomfortable and unsafe but that is just my upbringing"". Which I think is fair enough to say.

My wife's aunt turns to me and comes out with. ""Well that's because you are from a socialist country. You also have a queen that rules you people. You are not citizens. You are a subject. If you were allowed guns you would be a citizen"".  She then proceeds to tell me that the Syrian refugees coming over its bad and she needs to protect herself from them.

Fast forward an hour and she is pretty drunk. We are about to head back home. I thank everyone for the great meal and she turns and says ""too bad you are not going back to your own country"".  I don't say anything at all. I did not want to stoop to get level...then. 

Since then she has apologized.  Via text.  I reply saying ""no problem.  Dont worry about it""

So. We go to Houston for Christmas. She is there. We exchange gifts.  I hand her an envelope.  She opens it and as I expected, she loses her fucking mind.  Throws the piece of paper on the ground and storms out. 

My mother in law picks up the paper and reads. 

""A donation of $250 had been made to unicef usa for the Syrian Child Refugees by Uberhaqer on behalf of Aunts Name""

I just say ""I thought, judging by the pro life sticker on her car, she would appreciate that...my bad""

Drinks were hard and cheap and we were known for some of our destructive shots. 

A regular who was always a dick to everybody (no grounds to throw him out yet tho) was dicking around as usual, and while trying to be cool in front of his friends grabbed my ass. This is a total no bueno but i let it go. 

Just as it happens, a little later he comes to the bar, and to try to impress the gang again, orders our harshest shot  -  1/3 tequila,  1/3 80% absinthe, 1/3 Jägermeister and a few drops of Tabasco sauce.

Fucknuggets like him need to be punished and it's my time to shine. 

He isn't paying any attention to what i'm doing in the bar so i pour a tiny bit of the alcohols needed and top it up with Tabasco, which makes most of the shot now. 

He cheers, takes the shot, everybody's having a good time UNTIL he starts silently crying, coughing and then finally yelling at the top of his lungs and begging for an ambulance. 

That's where my smug smile appears when i calmly state ""Do *not* grab my ass again.""






EDIT: I didn't kick him out on the spot because none of my co-workers were there yet, nor the bouncer. So as a 5'1'' girl i have to pick my fights.

2015-12-23 08:01:25+00:00,2193,Don't be a dick to whoever is serving you alcohol,zrfisher,"I worked as a bartender in an Irish pub connected to a hotel for the last couple of years and generally enjoy it except for odd occurrences like anybody else in the service industry. Anyway, since it is connected to a hotel we get a lot of businessmen who stay frequently.

This one guy, let's call him Chad, stayed in the hotel Monday-Thursday every single week and frequented our bar (and by frequented, I mean he was there from our 4pm open to close every single day he was there).  Chad always bragged about how much money he makes (yet he was a poor tipper), would always criticize others' food choices, tell them to go to other places for food, and he made snide remarks about how weak my drinks are (i actually have a decently heavy hand... i pour 2.25 ounces in a drink instead of the typical 1.5 ounce pour), among other things... Basically Chad is a grade-A D-bag.

Chad's drink of choice was a grey goose ginger which ran him $7 per drink and he rarely drank less than 10 of them so he always ran a decent sized tab.  Every single drink he would ask me if i forgot to put the alcohol in his drink or make some other remark about how weak the drink was.  It really bugged me because I pour right in front of my customers so they can see their drink being prepared.  He would always try things to get more alcohol like asking me for a tall (a tall in reality is just a bigger glass so you get more mix but the same amount of alcohol).

One day (and everyday after that) I decided to take revenge on Chad by giving him less alcohol by plugging the air hole so the alcohol flows out much slower making the illusion that he is getting the same or more than usual when in reality he is getting about 3/4 ounce of alcohol and then I finish it with a quick pour down the straw so his first sip is strong.  As a result, he started buying around 15 drinks instead of the normal 10 so he wasted about $35 more dollars per night and got less drunk. 

Suck it, Chad.

2015-12-14 02:20:05+00:00,2213,Never mess with a flight attendant.,yellow_jelloo,"Not mine as I was only privileged to observe, not deliver.

I was on a Thursday afternoon flight from DC to New York. This flight is, perhaps not surprisingly, generally filled with bankers, lobbyists, and other suits who generally know the drill.

Once in a while though, you get a guy who decides that his personal business is more important than everyone else's desire to get home. On this day, I had the unfortunate luck to be seated in the aisle seat next to one of these people - in this case, a stereotypical 50-60 year old banker/finance guy, slightly balding, dressed in a suit that fit him just a little too loosely. He was yelling over the phone at someone to ""get him on this deal"" loudly enough for the entire cabin of the A320 to hear. I shrugged, put in my headphones, and started blasting music to drown out the details of his deal, figuring that he'd probably hang up once we pushed off the gate.

Nope. The doors slammed shut, the plane pushed off the gate, and the flight attendant, an industry veteran with the look of someone who had been doing her job a little too long, finally finishes her safety demo. As she's walking down the aisle during the seatbelt check she reminds him, with the broadest forced smile, ""Sir, you're not on the phone, are you? The captain will take us back to the gate and remove you."" He stammers an apology and promises to hang up. A minute later, the plane is in line to takeoff. The attendant walks back up and notices that he hasn't hung up. The smile is gone. ""Sir, I really will ask the captain to remove you off this plane,"" she threatens, and she watches him as he reluctantly gets off the phone.

Seemingly satisfied, the attendant walks back up front. But a moment later, she comes back with all the safety demo equipment - the oxygen mask, the seat belt, and the safety manual. She stands right next to me and stares at phone guy. ""Excuse me sir,"" she said, ""I do need to ensure that you heard the entirety of the safety demo.” The guy tries to stammer that he really did know the safety protocol, but the hostess silences him. “Sir, it is crucial that I make sure you understand protocol, as it presents a safety risk to you and others if you missed the demonstration.""

The surrounding passengers start snickering as phone guy reddens, and he’s forced to sit and pay attention through how to properly operate a seatbelt, where the exit doors are, and how to put on the oxygen mask.

""Please assist yourself before you attempt to assist others,"" the hostess reminds him, grinning widely as she snaps the mask on.

The demonstration takes a couple of more minutes, at the end of which the guy is reduced to staring straight down at his phone, bright as a tomato. Upon landing, he immediately starts up his call again, but in a whisper instead, and hurries out of the plane without making eye contact with anyone.

Unfortunately you always get scammers in god knows what country that try to1)  get your Paypal info and scam you or 2) mail you a fake check and get you to send the excessive amount back to them…Check bounces and you are out all the money.   

So this is the play:  Scammer contacts seller to buy car and promises to pay more than car is worth.  He says the car is going to be picked up by “shipping agent”.  Check is mailed, seller goes to bank and takes cash out for the amount that was over asking price.  Seller electronically sends money to scammer.  Check eventually bounces and seller is out a few grand with his bank.  Car never gets picked up but you are out money.  In the US you legally owe the bank that money. 

So one day I had some time on my hands and decided to play along with this scammer.  They always communicate via text or email.  There is never a credible number to call back.  I tried to waste his time by asking a LOT of questions. His method of scamming was the same as the example I gave above.  So pretty much you know this is shit when they want to buy a car without looking at it. The car was selling for 16k and he was going to send 19k by “mistake” and asked I just send the 3k back to him.  Cool, I agree and keep in daily touch with him on the details.  **The beauty here is that In his mind he has a pay day coming!** Most likely he is in an impoverished county and $1 will go a long way there.  If these guys get one scam every 3 months they are doing well.  Every day I thank him and tell him how much this will help me and my family and my special need child.  So he sends the check to a fake address I gave him and asks if I received it. I tell him thank you so much for the check. He asks that I send the money back immediately.  At this point it has been over 2 weeks of us communicating.  I act like I have the check and tell him that I REALLY need a new TV and if it is okay that I use the extra money for that instead.  He starts to get angry and demand that I send it back. I keep him going for a few hours promising him that I will pay him back. *(Remember this is all over text messages)* Eventually he loses his cool and gets nasty with me.   I finally apologize and say that I will send him the money.  He gives me the numbers I need to send it electronically and I confirm that he is at the store to pick up his money. This goes on for another hour as I keep asking him to check and see if the money arrives.  **So not only is his appetite wet, he is at the store waiting on his payout.**   I finally n tell him I knew from the beginning that he is a scammer and that I utterly enjoyed wasting his time and playing with his emotions. He says: ‘You stupid piece of fuck cunt shit”  I laugh and blow up his phone with 50 random texts saying how stupid he was and how smart I was.  

Petty, but it felt great. I know it ruined his day as he was expecting a payout for at least 2 weeks.

I would have had to pull a U-turn in a back lane, drive 500 feet, take two left turns, drive 600 feet, two more left turn 100 more feet to get into the parking spot that was now 20 feet away from me. The two ladies in the truck were unloading groceries from the back of the truck at a very cumbersome pace. So I respond ""can you pull ahead 20 feet or pull into the empty driveway (yes they had a spot they could have pulled in too) to let me pass?"" To which she responds ""no, my flashers are on I have 10 minutes to unload."" So I was having none of this nonsense so I turn my car off, put my flashers on, go to my parents, get my moms keys, reverse her car into the back lane, and put her flashers on. I now have my vehicle and my moms vehicle blocking them in. They are finishing their unloading of groceries and start to go off on me saying they will call a tow truck and so on, and several other verbal abuses, to which I respond, ""My flashers are on, I'll only be 10 minutes."" I moved the car 5 minutes later, the people in question were not amused.

2015-11-10 16:57:53+00:00,2714,"Harass my Counter Clerk = Get Banned, Arrested, and Towed",lendergle,"I was 18 and in my first ""managerial"" job.  I.e. Swing Shift Manager at a fast food burger joint.  Like every place, we had a couple of ""usuals"" who were assholes for the sake of being assholes.  One of them, an over-the-top egregiously aggressive woman who found fault with everything, would go ballistic if you so much as failed to address her as ""ma'am"" in every sentence.  
Things came to a head when she was so rude to one of our counter clerks that she made the girl cry.  I told the girl to go back to the break room and take a breather, and then calmly informed the woman that she was no longer welcome in our store.  That triggered the nuclear option.  I waited for the screaming and cursing to stop, waved her to the door, and then watched as she left.  
I sent Corporate her CC number and license plate info, and they sent her a ""you're banned from ALL the stores"" letter, filed it with the local PD, and told us to call the cops immediately if she ever showed up in our store again.  
Which she did.  A few weeks later, she showed up ready to launch into another tirade for whatever imagined offense might occur.  We politely kicked her out despite her screaming that the do-not-trespass order was fake, wasn't legal, didn't apply to her, her lawyer said ...  It happened again a couple of times, but eventually her luck broke and there happened to be two cops on their dinner break in the restaurant.  
I was on shift that night.  And I can tell you that I have rarely been so satisfied as when I showed the officers the order, identified the woman as the person referred to in it, told them about the frequent return visits and then watched them arrest her on the spot.  Best of all, I never had to testify- she went totally ballistic and scratched a cop's face.  No need to book her for trespassing when resisting arrest and cop assault were so convenient!  
Now, the vast majority of this story is Instant Karma.  So why am I posting in /r/pettyrevenge ?  The answer is simple: After they hauled her away, I noticed that her car was still in our lot...   Oh yissss.  That call to the towing company was the most satisfying two minutes of my young life.  Sure, I could have just let it sit there until she came back for it.  But make my register clerk cry?  Yeah, enjoy your trip to the impound lot... ma'am.  
tl;dr: rude customer got banned, refused to stop returning, got arrested for some instant karma.  Then I pettyrevenged her ass by having her car towed.
EDIT to answer some questions:  
 - *How is the clerk doing?*  She was fine by the next day.  No lasting issues that I noticed.  
 - *Did you stay in management?*  No.  I quit in my freshman year of college.  I'm more of a tech-head these days, so I leave the management up to other people.  
 - *Why did you send the CC # to corporate? Wouldn't that be mishandling of the information to send it unsecured via email to a corporate office?*  When my franchise owner and I called the corporate offices to report the incident, they asked for the entire receipt history for that visit including the credit card #.  I don't think we actually *sent* it to them.  They probably just pulled it from their computers or something.  
 - *So, you were her manager...... You dated a while. Didn't mention to her that the crazy bitch that made her cry got arrested and towed?*  To clarify, yes we discussed it.  N.B. The original question was ""Did the clerk get to witness the call?"" so my answer that I was sure she was aware of it didn't specify how.  
 - *Ever find out what happened to her in court?*  No.  All I got was a call from the arresting officer stating that I would not need to give a statement other than what I had told him at the time.

2015-11-08 19:53:25+00:00,3733,Racist woman on bus gets more than she bargains for..,Dragonflie,"A couple months ago, I was on a 7 hour bus ride when I was seated by a woman from hell.  When I boarded the bus, I was told that it wasn't fully booked so I assumed it would be alright if I left my backpack and personal items on the seat beside me so no one would sit with me.  I normally wouldn't do this, but I am someone who gets extremely motion sick (no amount of meds or other remedies seems to help) and since this bus ride was going through the mountains I thought I'd save someone the trouble of sitting next to a puking, feverish girl.

Anyways, I rode like this for about an hour and half the bus was empty so I thought it didn't matter.  Then, out of nowhere, a woman across from me starts looking back and me, sending me death glares over and over.  At this point, we are slowly moving into the foothills of the mountains so I ignore her, trying to focus on relaxing and not letting the nausea overwhelm me.  

After about 20 minutes she comes over and says ""Excuse me I'm going to sit here"", pointing at the seat next to me.  I give her a look of frustration but being the non-confrontational person I am, I moved my stuff off the seat and allowed her to sit there despite 30 empty seats around us.  Intentionally, I scatter my stuff on the floor just enough so her feet don't have quite as much room as they should, hoping this would persuade her to leave.

Nope.  She begins kicking my things, hard.  I ask her, very politely, not to kick my things.  She looks at me with moral outrage.  ""Little girl, you don't own this fucking bus.  Give me my fucking space, I am 60 years old.  You little Indian bitches seem to think you own this fucking country.""  So, the realization sets in that this woman is a racist bitch who intentionally sat with me to bitch me out.  

I am really a Canadian citizen, born and raised here, however I am brown because my mother is a Filipina.  Anyways, I tell her there is no need to be so hostile and as she begins to snort rude remarks back to me, I put on my headphones and blast the loudest Radiohead songs I can find, just to bug her.  At this point, the anger boiling up inside of me and the nausea are beginning to get to me so I decide it is best to ignore her.

But she won't let that happen.  She begins elbowing me, hard.  Then, kicking my leg.  I finally give in and take of my headphones.  She demands that I turn down my music.  I demand that she leaves me alone. Suddenly, from the corner of my eye I see her opening her water bottle and pouring it all over my backpack and personal belongings.  I push it out of her hands at which point she begins SCREAMING obscenities at me, telling me I am abusing a poor elderly woman with back problems, that I'm taking up too much space, that I am part of the ""Indian problem"" that is destroying our respectable nation.  

At this point, the anxiety and the mountainous bus ride is just too much to bear.  As she screams at me, I realize I need to throw up and although I could interrupt her to quickly run to the bathroom, I instead decide it was okay if I just let it go in her lap.  I am terribly sick so I end up vomiting almost an entire sandwich onto her.  She stops for a moment out of shock, and then begins to hit me as hard as she fucking can.  I am a tiny little half Asian girl who weighs less than 95 lbs, and she's huge.  People around who have been hearing her bullshit finally, at this point, call for the bus driver who pulls the bus over in the town we are passing through.

The woman demands I be removed from the bus for elderly abuse.  The other passengers back me up and defend me after witnessing the insanity.  The police are called and the woman is escorted off the bus, literally kicking and screaming about how Indians should be banned from public transit.  Last I see of her, she is being held by police on the side of the road, covered in vomit..  As much as I believe you shouldn't vomit on people on purpose, I must admit that my motion sickness has never felt so good before..  Also, I ended up getting a coupon for a free ticket with the bus company as an apology for what happened, which was only an added bonus.

TL;DR: Racist woman sits beside me in almost empty bus.  Terrorizes me for so long that I vomit in her lap.  Forcibly removed from the bus by police for being a racist bitch.  HA.  

Edit:  So many people are asking me: ""Why didn't you just get up and move to a different seat?"".  My answer is, I probably should have.  But, I am easily intimidated and I was just hoping that she'd leave me alone.  Once she started acting nasty, then it became an issue of pride.  I didn't want her to get her way, so in my passive-aggressive sort of way, I was fighting back by not switching seats.  Also, I was feeling so ill I probably would have vomited anyway had I attempted to gather my things and move.  I can't say it was the right thing to do, or worth it, but that's how it happened.  I have social anxiety so I get very nervous and don't think clearly in such situations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/3s1h8n/racist_woman_on_bus_gets_more_than_she_bargains/,pettyrevenge,367,

2015-11-05 14:56:06+00:00,2327,"Neighbor blasted Aerosmith, I took her electricity, money and food away",BlazeCT,"Forgive me, as this is my first post in r/pettyrevenge. 

I lived in an apartment building for a couple years.  This building was a part of a larger condo association.  There are town homes and some building with apartments all of which you could own.  I rented from a landlord.  The building I was in had two one bedroom apartments in the front about 900 sq ft and two two bedroom apartments in the back about 1200 sq ft.  This was repeated for three floors so 12 apartments in total.  I had one of the one bedrooms on the first floor where it was me a 23/m at the time and my dog.  The tenants were a mix of older folks and younger professionals like myself.  There was one middle aged alcoholic woman that was the pain in everyone’s ass.

About a week after I had moved in it was about 1am and suddenly over the sound of my own tv I hear Aerosmith blasting.  After a quick process of elimination, I determine it’s the drunk upstairs.  I walk up stairs and not wanting to piss anyone off, decide to politely knock on the door and ask her to turn it down.  After knocking a couple times, there’s no answer.  I retreat back to my apartment throw some headphones in and go to sleep.  The next day upon returning from work I decide to go knock on the door to see if she’s home.  She answers and I politely ask her to try to keep the music down after 10pm Sunday through Thursday.  Don’t worry about Friday or Saturday because I’ll be out or hammered and it won’t matter.  

Over the course of the next few weeks everything goes smoothly.  Some other neighbors warn me that it will happen again and she’s been like this since she moved in.  I say shame on them for never trying to do anything about it.  They say “you’ll see”.  Sure enough, a couple nights later Aerosmith is blasting at 3am.  I go up and knock on the door.  She answers the door, clearly hammered and calls me an asshole and shuts the door.  I go back downstairs and call the cops.  Cops arrive, she’s rude to them and they do nothing but give her a warning.  They leave and she turns the music back up.  They come back and only another warning.  This happens a handful of times after this and I finally accept defeat, the cops can’t or won’t help.  

A few days after this, I hear her in the shower as I take a crap.  Her bathroom is right above me.  The light bulb goes off in my head and I hurry into the basement where there’s some storage areas for all tenants and look for a hot water disconnect.  I determine my revenge will be turning her hot water off every time I hear her in the shower above.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t find the hot water disconnect.  I do find another treasure though hidden in a small area behind one of the storage units that you wouldn’t even guess was there, a large breaker panel.  I open it up and find breakers for the hallway and staircase lights etc.  But wait!  There’s a breaker for every individual apartment also.  My plan is now set and I walk back smirking to my apartment…waiting.

Finally, my day has arrived.  I wake up at about 2 am and hear…..Aerosmith.  This time it’s music to my ears though.  I grab a flashlight and hurry down stairs.  I find her apartment’s breaker and turn it off.  I take my victory lap around the basement and walk back up to my apartment.  I can hear stomping and screaming but she can’t figure out why her apartment’s electricity isn’t on but the lights in the hallway are.  I hear her knock on neighbor’s doors but no one has the answer.  I smile and go back to sleep.  The next day I wake up and go turn her power back on.  I was working from home that day and as I sit at my table and return some e-mails I see the electrical service guy arrive.  From the bit of conversation I could eavesdrop on, it was clear he had no idea what had happened, and thought she was a little crazy.  After he left I saw her carry out all the food in her fridge that had gone bad.

As months progressed, every so often she would start blasting the music.  I would go downstairs cut her power off and turn it back on hours later.  She never picked up on the correlation between her music and losing power somehow.  Every time she would call the electrical service guy, I would turn the power back on before he arrived.  She would then be charged for the visit and lose money throwing out the contents of her fridge.

This worked for two years up until about a week before I moved and forgot to turn it back on one day and there was a lock on the breaker box.  

TL;DR: neighbor was repeatedly blasting aerosmith late at night, so i turned off her power and made her food in the fridge go bad.

On my way back with a soft pretzel in hand, I see the a woman with her kids and she's moving all of my stuff to a different seat so her and her kids can take my spot. I stomach it, grab my stuff and move to a different spot. While I'm sitting there eating my pretzel, I notice her and her kids all going to the bathroom. I seize the opportunity. I run, grab all their stuff, and move it to seats right in front of the entrance so they'll see it as soon they walk in. I then reclaim my rightful place in my perfect spot. The lady comes in, sees her stuff, looks at me, connects the dots, and now has been shooting the occasional death glance from the front row and every other spot filled up.

2015-10-20 13:37:43+00:00,2856,Sushi thief gets a taste of justice,oversoul00,"I was at this club one night that had two levels, one for dancing and one that is a bar type area with some food. After hanging out on the first floor all night I decide to go get some food on the second level because by this point I'm drunk and starving. 

I look on the menu and I am a little surprised that they have sushi and decide that is going to be the solution to my hunger. I'm chatting with my girl waiting for my food to arrive and once it does I'm super happy and I start chowing down while still chatting away. The table we were sitting at was a little small so the server sat the sushi on the table behind me and the area wasn't packed so I thought no big deal.

So I'm turning away from my girl to eat and toward her to talk. About the fifth turn in as I'm getting more food there is a super drunk guy eating my fucking sushi! Now I'm a little compassionate because I have done stupid drunk things too but I'm also really pissed that he is eating my food. We make eye contact and he knows he is wrong, I know he is wrong, and I very calmly push the glob of wasabi and ginger that I have barely touched toward him and tell him that if he doesn't eat them in one bite we are going to have a problem. He surprisingly does because I guess our drunk brains agreed that would be dispensed justice. He eats them both in one bite and proceeds to have somewhat of a rough time with it coughing and eyes watering.

2015-10-08 14:51:51+00:00,2688,Don't Want To Follow the Rules? Go Home.,ListenToTheStooges,"This happened many years ago. At the time I was working at a popular tourist attraction that had a hall that could be rented after-hours for events and functions. The hall could be accessed in a number of ways, including a doorway that opened out onto the street. During functions, we would often use this doorway to let smokers in and out of the building. The only rule was that they had to leave their drinks on a table near the door, since liquor wasn't allowed on the street.

One night we were holding a holiday party for a large bank. For whatever reason, a number employees of this bank thought they could take their drinks out with them when they were having a smoke. This is not legal in our city. I was posted near the door to make sure they didn't do this because, if they were spotted by police or we were subjected to a random liquor inspection (it happens), we could lose our liquor license.

One employee was particularly douchey about not following this rule. In fact, let's call him DB. The very first time he attempted to bring his drink out with him, I stopped him and let him know the rule. He looked me square in the eye and said.

""What a terrible shame it is that I can't enjoy my scotch with a cigarette"".

I looked him square in the eye back and replied:

""Yes sir. The world is in mourning. Now please. Leave your drink on the table if you're planning to go outside.""

From then on, DB didn't like me. For the rest of the night he would attempt to hide his drink under his coat, get his friends to distract me, or sneak in and take his drink outside when I wasn't looking. Every time he did this I would quietly approach him and ask that he please take his drink back inside and leave it on the table. Every time he would openly mock and insult me in front of the entire group of smokers.

The last straw happened when he got a number of his friends to walk out the door en masse with their drinks, as some sort of First World Problem Protest. This time, after herding them all back inside, I radioed our building's maintenance worker and asked him to lock the door. 

No more smoking area.

DB and his friends' howls of protest attracted the attention of their boss, who had planned (and was paying for) the event. He asked me what the problem was and then proceeded to tell off DB and his friends for acting like a bunch of immature dickwads. He then asked me what he could do to fix this so that the smoking area could be reopened.

I pointed right at DB and said ""I want him gone"". The boss nodded and told DB to get his jacket and go home.

I made sure to be at the coatcheck when he left. I handed him his jacket and said ""Have a nice night, sir.""

2015-10-04 21:20:10+00:00,2508,"Kick the back of my seat like a child? Enjoy nose scum, you scum.",Copacetic_Detritus,"So today I was on a flight from Oakland, CA to Ontario, CA. Mind you, this is not a long flight. It's usually about 45 minutes, so when most people are doing something annoying/ unacceptable on the flight, I can ignore it pretty well due to the short exposure.

Today however, I got a chance to pettily punish someone that I could not pass up.

This grown-ass man was sitting in the seat behind me, and even before we took off, he started bumping up against the back of my seat.  I thought ""he's a tall guy, and must be uncomfortable, so I'll give him like ten minutes to settle down.""

He did not settle down.

He constantly kicked the back of my seat for the entire flight. I know I should have turned around and told him to knock it off (gently, of course), but part of me was hoping that he would be a decent enough human to realize how horrible he was being. I'm not a confrontational person, and I'll avoid social interaction with strangers if I can help it. So, I settled in and gritted my teeth.

Much to my disgust, he not only does not stop the kicking, he decides it's ok to cram his smelly, unkempt man foot right up next to me, between my arm rest and the wall (I was in the window seat).

At this point, I think he must realize what he's doing- he's so very clearly violating my personal space. I wait patiently to move his foot, but of course, he just leaves it there.

So the pilot announces we were making our final descent into Ontario, and I had just about had it with the smell of this dude's foot and his constant kicking. 

In fact, the smell was so bad, it was kind of tickling my nose.

It tickled my nose enough to kind of make me have to sneeze.

Normally, I would have not done what happened next because it is uncalled for and wrong, but I had been listening to Eugene Mirman and his sardonic comedy kind of pushed me over the edge to ""fuck it"" level.

I sneezed on this dude's nasty foot. I pretended I was covering my nose and mouth with my arm and turning my head away from the passenger to my left. Even though I apparently sneezed into the crook of my arm, In reality I missed it completely and most of my nose juice landed in his flip-flop clad foot.

Needless to say he immediately retracted his foot. 

He couldn't say shit to me, either. He didn't bother to confront me, but if he had, I would have apologetically said I didn't realize his foot was there. Between my window and my seat. So sorry.

TL,DR;; I sneezed on a man's foot because he invaded my personal bubble on an airplane and would not stop kicking the back of my seat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/3nhvo5/kick_the_back_of_my_seat_like_a_child_enjoy_nose/,pettyrevenge,153,

2015-09-28 17:34:54+00:00,2323,Won't break my $20?,mcdonaldstrump,"This happened about ten years ago, but I was recently reminded of it. 

I owed a friend $5 or $10 and was headed by his house, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to repay him. As I was driving to his place, I realized I only had $20 bills and knew it was unlikely he had change for me, so I stopped into a local convenience store to make change. 

Now, I'm pretty considerate when it comes to asking stores to make change. I know convenience stores don't like $20s, so I didn't even consider outright asking for change. I walked to the row of glass doored refrigerators in back and grabbed a Coke. I even reached into the back to get the coldest one since it was a scorching hot summer day. 

I waited my turn in line, and handed the clerk the Coke. He scanned it and $1 and some change pops up on the screen. I open my wallet and pull out a $20. He asks, ""got anything smaller?"" I show him my wallet which has three other $20s inside, saying ""no, sorry, I don't.""

""Well, I've got too many $20s,"" (or something similar), he replies. I politely asked him again to make the sale as it was hot and I didn't have any smaller bills, getting nowhere.

I turn to leave and he says, ""put that Coke back."" No please, nothing. I continue walking out and reply, ""no thanks,"" and leave.

2015-09-23 10:20:49+00:00,2374,Netflix? No chill.,Schelander,"So, this happened a few months ago, but I just remembered it would fit in this sub.

I was talking to a girl for about a month or so. We were really starting to click and we hung out two or three times a week. About three weeks into our ""flirtationship,"" she and I were chilling at her house and were really bored. I had Netflix and she didn't, so we turned on her dad's XBox and I logged into Netflix on it.

Now, after about another week or two, she decided to call things off- and in quite a bitchy manner. She stopped talking to me, texting me, and taking my calls and said she didn't want to date me and that it was my fault. To avoid sounding sour about it still, I'll just say that she wasn't very reasonable. So, I tried to get over it as soon as possible, and went about my business.

And then it happened.

I was at home, playing Call of Duty or something. I saw her dad's username pup up, saying he was online (her parents were pretty fond of me, and her dad added me over the course of those few weeks). I went onto my friends list to see if he was getting on a game I had to, and I realized it wasn't him. ""Netflix"" popped up on his activity log. She was still using my Netflix account after completely shutting me out. So I did possibly the pettiest thing I've ever done- yet it was satisfying to no end.

Today, I had this lady call 3 or 4 times over the course of about 15 minutes looking to be transferred to our daycare subsidy office. The next time she calls she says to me that she wants daycare subsidy ""but I do NOT want voicemail!""

I explain to her that, unfortunately, there is only one extension available for their main reception and if staff is unavailable their voicemail will pick up.

She very rudely asks if she failed to make herself clear and says, again, she doesn't want voicemail. I explain, again, that there is only one line to transfer to and that I can not force them to answer. We go around in circles like this for a few minutes until she decides to threaten me with ""Do I need to talk to the mayor's office about this?!"" I told her that it was up to her and I would transfer her if she would like.

One day out of the blue my watch list no longer had all of my movies and TV shows that I was really looking forward to watching and was replaced with crime stories shows and shitty reality tv. She logged in to my account thinking it was hers and removed everything, she even watched so much shows that my recently viewed wasn't my own. I feel like a logical person would realize that maybe since nothing looked familiar they would realize maybe they clicked the wrong profile. She said is was an accident but laughed it off saying now I can watch her shows and have something to talk about. For the past few months I have been watching strategically picked programs on her profile so swerve the recommended programs, mostly LGBT shows since she is kinda homophobic. I will also add really bad, or really fucked up movies to her watch list.  

TL;DR Mother in law deletes my to watch list on Netflix, I secretly add things to annoy her and fuck with her recommended list.  
  
Note: I just wanted to add that I'm sure it was a accident but still it was very annoying. My MIL and I get along very well but sometime we can get on each other's nerves. We have taken painting classes together and gone shopping so it's not like we are not friends but sometimes I just want to stick it her for getting in my business.

While I'm waiting in line this woman (We'll call her ""Loud Bitch"" = LB) is shrieking down her phone to who I can only presume is her now totally deaf boyfriend. She's visibly pissing off most people in the general vicinity with her swearing and general attitude.

As It's coming up to my turn to check out, she's decided she's fed up with waiting and puts her big bag of M&amp;M's in front of my lunch on the conveyor and says *""I need to go first.""* 

Without so much as a moment to think and without making eye contact I pick them up and move them behind my items, saying nothing.

**RED ALERT: DIVERT ALL POWER TO BITCH DRIVE**

&gt; LB: *""What the fuck are you doing?""*

&gt; Me: *""I was here first, wait your turn.""*

&gt; LB: *""Fuck you I am on my lunch break and I have a very important job blah blah blah""* (I can't remember the whole rant)

&gt; Me: *""It's lunchtime, everyone is on lunch, you have to wait""*

&gt; LB: *""Fuck you! I asked nicely!""* (lolwut.)

At this point LB throws her M&amp;M's in front of my lunch still ranting and it's now my turn to check out, enter awesome check-out girl. (Who we'll call ""ACG"".)

So after seeing the bag of M&amp;M's land on the conveyor I decide, fuck it and I accept LB's gracious offering and buy the M&amp;M's for myself, leaving her M&amp;M-less.

Of course the battle was not yet over, more screaming was coming my way.

&gt; LB: *""What are you doing, those are mine!""*

&gt; Me: *""Nope, I'm paying for them now, if you want M&amp;M's you'll have to go get some and wait in line.""*

&gt; LB: *""You're a theif! You stole my M&amp;M's!*""

&gt; Me: *""No I just bought the M&amp;M's you rudely threw onto my pile of stuff.""*

&gt; LB: *""I'm not getting anymore, give me my M&amp;M's back. You're a thief!""*

&gt; ACG: *""Ma'am, I suggest you go and get a new pack and wait in line, there are people waiting. The gentlemen hasn't stolen anything, he paid money for the M&amp;M's.""*

&gt; LB: ""*Call the fucking manager, get this piece of shit kicked out for stealing.*""

&gt; Me: *""Mind if I step out anyway? I have a very important job and I'm on lunch?""*

&gt; LB: *""Where the fuck are you goi-""*

&gt; ACG: *""Sure, here's your receipt.""*

&gt; Me: *""Thanks.""*

To wrap up, the M&amp;M's were delicious, I shared them with my co-workers. Don't know if LB went back to get some, but I highly recommend them.

I noticed my gas tank almost empty, so I pulled into a station behind the car in front of me. There were two pumps open on the end, so I kept following the car in front...until the car stopped at the first pump instead of pulling through to the second pump. There was just enough room to squeeze my car by between the car at the first pump and a fence. As I'm driving by I see a teenage girl give me an exaggerated sad smirk while her friend laughed. Wrong move, ladies.

I pull into the second pump, but I do NOT leave them enough room to pull by after they finish pumping gas. I decided today to pay inside for my gas and take a few minutes perusing the store, grabbing a soda, and chatting with the clerk. When I noticed the girls are done pumping their gas I walked slowly back to my car and started pumping gas. As the gallons ticked by they start to realize their mistake and are getting annoyed. I finished pumping my gas, but as I'm about to get in my car I noticed my windows are awfully dirty. It would be unsafe to drive without them clean, but luckily the gas station has so conveniently provided a squeegee and cleaner. I promptly did my duty and cleaned every window on my car.

As I walked to put the squeegee away I noticed the first girl flipping me off. I gave her the same exaggerated sad face she showed me earlier. Not so funny now, is it?

**TL/DR;** Two teens didn't pull through to the last pump at gas station and mocked me as I squeezed by. I made sure they realized their mistake and I now have a full tank of gas, a delicious soda, and squeaky clean windows.

2015-09-12 02:47:58+00:00,2385,Crazy homeowner's association enforcer gets a taste of her own medicine.,CoulterPatton,"I'm housesitting at the moment for my cousin. He and his boyfriend live in a pretty swanky neighborhood full of McMansions. Nothing too fancy, just your common upper-middle class suburban development. Anyhow… over the past few weeks they've been having a new porch installed on the back of the house. The crew has a trailer parked out front so they can lock up their tools at night. No big deal right? 

Apparently it is. 

This evening I get a knock on the door. I'm always wary of solicitors, so I make it a point to look out the window before answering the door. After hearing the doorbell it takes me a minute to get to the window. As I look outside I see a woman walking away with two little dogs. One of the dogs stops and proceeds to shit on my cousin's lawn. 

I wait until the dog is done and open the door. By this time the woman is beginning to walk away but she sees me and turns around. She introduces herself as a board member of the HOA (homeowners association). She looks VERY annoyed. Without taking a breath she launches into a lecture about the trailer parked out front, how she's ""lucky to have walked by and caught this egregious violation of the HOA rules"" and how the trailer is an ""eyesore on the neighborhood"". She says she won't report me to the board and suggest a fine if I remove it immediately. 

I calmly inform her about the patio construction and how the crew needs to store their tools and materials at night, but she's absolutely foaming at the mouth about how ""tacky"" it is to have a trailer in front of the house and (again) it's against the rules. I calmly inform her that I am not the homeowner, nor the owner of the trailer and there isn't much I can do about it (especially at 6:30 PM on a Friday night). Nevertheless, she's adamant that I do SOMETHING. 

By this point I'm fed up with this woman, who obviously has nothing better to do with her evening than bother her neighbors with bullshit. I look at her and casually ask ""just out of curiosity, what's the fine for not picking up after your dog if it shits in someone's lawn?"". I tell ya, the look on her face at that point was classic. She stuttered for a minute before telling me she would ""have to look into that…"". I told her I'd be grateful if she did because my cousin has been suspecting a neighbor of letting their dog poop in his lawn, so he set up a video camera in the window to catch the culprit. Upon hearing that, she got a little flustered and told me to tell the patio crew to hurry up, then she walked away with a huff. 

A small victory to be sure, but quite satisfying nevertheless.

I explained I drove like a bat-outa-hell to get there and I really needed my medicine, and that it would be another week before I could get back. She gave a smirk, shook her head no, and pointed at the pharmacist who didn't look too concerned either. I turned and asked him if I could have my pills.

Being persistent, I said, ""fine, just give me the prescription the doctor gave me and I'll go to (competitor) and have it filled.""

I'm pissed, it's  Saturday night, I have nothing pressing, and I'm about to make a point.  I insisted on the prescription and refused the pills.

I told the lady (known henceforth as Jane) that i had already paid it via online banking the week prior. She said it probably hadn't processed and hung up. Jane continued calling daily, however. I again told her it had been paid the 2nd and 3rd time she called—same lady btw. The 4th time, I requested an email address to send her proof that it was paid. She gave me a fax number. A fucking fax number. We don't have a fax machine at my work because, ya know, it's not 1991 anymore. I insisted on an email address and she finally gave me one. I sent them a PDF of my health savings account statement after I cropped out all the account numbers.

This should have taken care if it, right? wrong. Jane called the next day and now needs a copy of the check from my HSA bank. Getting pretty pissed at this point. I am overloaded at work as it is and they are interrupting my day because of their shitty system. Whatever, I just need to end this.

I called my bank and requested a copy of the check. They sent one 2 days later. I forwarded this check image to the same email address they originally provided. In the email I stated that I would like a confirmation reply that shows Jane A.) received this email and B.) will be removing me from the call list.

I got zero replies. So every day for the last 4 days I have been calling the billing department and specifically asking for Jane. Enjoy my incessant phone calls because it is now YOU that has to provide PROOF TO ME. What's that? ""no need to call because it should be taken care of now""...NOPE. I simply MUST call daily to confirm where I am at in the system to get written approval. What's that? ""there is a confirmation in the mail"". SORRY, I'm going to need IMMEDIATE confirmation that what you are saying is true. I'll stop calling when I have letter in my hand.

Edit: TIL I am stupid. I called Jane yet again today requesting a confirmation of payment via email. Jane was out or busy apparently. Instead I got someone else who informed me that my payment was still due! I almost shit my pants with anger when she said that. I had had enough. I requested supervisor. I start ranting, ""The bill was 105.54. I set up online payee using information on bill. I paid 105.54 to that payee. I sent proof of that payment. Mark it paid and send me confirmation!"" That's about the point they informed me that I was missing a chromosome. Apparently, there were in fact, TWO bills for 105.54 that posted within a week of one another from the same doctor. One was for my visit to urgent care for a spider bite. One was for my daughter's visit for temperature of 103. Though they should have informed me of 2 bills in their system during the first phone call, it is ultimately my fault for identifying my medical bills based on the amount due instead of the date of service &amp; patient name. Once i realized what was happening, I apologized for everything and said I would get the 2nd bill paid immediately. I then derped my way off of the phone as fast as I could because it was hard to hear with all the shaming going on. So now I'm embarrassed AND I have to pay another 105.54. My conclusion is that, similar to spiderman, my spider bite gave me special powers—mine were just a different kind of special.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/3j4fcs/harass_me_about_unpaid_bill_that_i_paid_already/,pettyrevenge,154,

I was 7 years old and my sister was 12.  I was the youngest, she was the middle and my brother was 17.  We had a pretty typical older sister-younger brother relationship.  I would annoy her, she would make fun of me.  It was pretty standard.  One day, after annoying her by trying to play with her and her friend, she told me ""If you look up the word 'moron' in the dictionary, you'll see your picture there.""  Being 7 years old, I run upstairs, grab the dictionary off the shelf, bring it downstairs and my mother and I flip to the M section.  We get to 'moron' and sure as shit, there's my school photo, scotch taped into the dictionary.  I cried my eyes out.  When did she put my picture in there? How long was she sitting on that?  I have to admit it was a pretty good burn.  Now this story would come up throughout the years.  My mom would tell it to her friends, or to aunts and uncles at family parties.  It would get casually mentioned and laughed off between my immediate family and I.  It was a pretty funny, albeit mean, thing to do to a SEVEN year old.

As she goes to close the dictionary, I say, ""You should look up the word 'bitch'.""  She flips to 'bitch' and there in all it's glory is a picture of my sister, that I had taped into the dictionary about 7 years ago!  The entire table erupts in laughter.

2015-08-22 18:24:01+00:00,2246,[NSFW] Coitus Avoidus,expremierepage,"Back when I was in grad school, I lived in a single-family house with two other grad students (Belle and Ed). It was great; we all got along very well and had lots of good times. 

We had an extra bedroom, and the idea of having another grad student, Charles, move in was brought up at some point. Now, Charles had been to our house a few times for parties. He was the type of house guest that would flick bottle caps across the room without picking them up and leave his empties all around the house. Naturally, I had my misgivings about him, but got outvoted and he moved in. I wasn't super happy about it, but it saved me about $80 a month on rent, so oh well, it'll be worth it, right?

Nope. 

After a couple weeks, everyone regrets letting him move in. He's loud, doesn't do any common chores, usurps the common TV for shows no one likes (and turns the volume way up), wakes up every morning at 5am to do very loud, grunty exercise in his room with the door wide open; you get the idea.

Also, the house was very prone to getting fruit flies, so we all made sure to throw food-waste into the garbage disposer and never leave dirty dishes in the sink. But not Charles. Every morning, we'd wake up to find him already gone for the day, having left half a bowl of oatmeal in the trash and a dirty bowl in the sink. We were constantly infested with fruit flies from almost immediately after he moved in. We brought it up with him several times, but it made little difference.

I wish I could claim responsibility for it, but Belle got so fed up, she started moving the dirty dishes and bin into Charles' bedroom and closing the door. It didn't take long for him to start cleaning up after himself. After that, we managed to cohabitate for quite a while without any major issues, until he got a girlfriend. 

She was the most unpleasant person I've ever met. She thought she was better than everyone and got offended by us even trying to engage her in conversation (eg. she would smugly scoff and look at Charles like ""WTF"" if someone spoke to her). She left bobby pins along with clumps of her bushy, frizzy hair all over the place. She was also painfully unattractive and unintelligent (which wouldn't have been an issue if she hadn't acted so superior to everyone else). I just took to spending most of my time home in my room, avoiding both of them as much as possible.

So now onto my revenge...

Ed's family had a lake house a couple hours away, so we'd go there every so often, if only to get away from Charles for the weekend. On one such weekend, I was on-call for my lab and ended up needing to return home unexpectedly. After I took care of stuff in the lab, I got home around 10pm to find Charles and his girlfriend in the initial phases of having cheeky no-one's-home sex on couch in the living room. It was Belle's couch and she would have been furious.

Anyway, peering in as I was unlocking the door, it was obvious they were both naked, with clothes nowhere in sight. They thankfully managed to throw a blanket over themselves when they heard me coming in. I had planned on just grabbing some food from the kitchen, as I was starving, and heading to my bedroom. But then the giggling started. I don't know why, but the self-satisfied he's-so-oblivious/we're-getting-away-with-having-public-sex laughter really enraged me. 

Instead of going to my room, I turned the lights all the way up in the living room and plopped down on the chair right across from them to eat. Knowing how much the girlfriend disliked speaking with her inferiors, I started ranting about my day, the inconvenience of having to drive back to campus and asked them all kinds of questions about what they had been up to, still pretending to be oblivious to what they had actually been doing. It was extremely satisfying knowing I was holding them hostage, naked and sexually frustrated, under that blanket.

After I finished slowly eating my dinner, I planned to go to bed. I turned the lights back down and went to tidy up in the kitchen, but as soon as I was a few feet away, that same ""Teehee, we're so sneaky!"" laughter started back up. I grabbed a blanket from my room and quickly returned to the living room. 

""Mind if I watch some TV?""

They looked horrified, but it was my TV so they couldn't really say no. It was perfect. I turned on something like *Toddlers and Tiaras* or *Honey Boo Boo* to up the annoyance factor and spent the next two hours texting with Belle and Ed so they could share in the petty revenge.

Eventually, I fell asleep and woke to Charles and his girlfriend sneaking off to his bedroom. It was well past midnight at this point -- way past Charles' normal bedtime -- and they just went to sleep, sans fornication (thin walls and his door was open, so I should have heard if they had).

I ended up moving out a few months later and found out how glorious it is to live alone.

2015-08-15 18:28:41+00:00,2171,Entire school year of bullying by teacher,Zesparia,"This story happened way back when I was in high school, freshman year, just moved to a new goddamn state and everything. From literally day one, when I addressed my first year math teacher as ""m'am"" (I had moved from the deep south, she was from new york) and she thought I was out to make her look old and frumpy, she loathed my guts. Now, this math class was chaos. The teacher could not control a classroom. My mom was a teacher for years, I have serious fucking respect for high school teachers, aside from this one. Kids came to class dressed in banana suits, people would take shirts off in the middle of lectures, shoes would be tossed and played with like footballs, a couple people treated it like designated naptime and slept through everything. Everyone at this school in a school with over 2,000 students knew my class period as the one that had major fucking issues.

And in the middle of all this, the only one my teacher would discipline was me, so she could feel in control.

I would always finish my work early because hey, it was easy to me. I would finish the assigned problems and then pull out a book to read while ignoring all the other 14 year olds yelling and screeching and decidely not doing their work. This teacher would see me reading by myself and would make announcements like OH LOOK AT ZESPARIA READING AGAIN, ARE THEY DONE WITH THEIR WORK?? IT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO BE DOING OTHER THINGS WHEN I AM TALKING. The book would be snatched and taken up to her desk, with everyone watching and laughing as she would criticize my reading choices. This would bleed over to her conversations in general, she would bring me up in a conversation to make fun of me or my choices.

So being a personal punching bag was taking its toll on me, I got back in small ways like pointing out when she got problems wrong that she was teaching to the class, in front of everyone. But this did nothing to address my problems, despite feeling satisfying. I hatched a plan and one day in May, near the end of the year, I shoved four copies of the same fantasy book in my bag. I think I checked out every copy of the book from the school library plus brought my copy from home. That day in class went as normal, I finished my work early, and pulled out my book. She saw me reading and got a nasty grin on her face and stood up, and started posturing about how I was reading my dumb books again, I needed to learn to focus on my work and not bring stuff like that into a MATH class. She took the book, turned around to walk back to her desk, spun around and set it down with a flourish..... and saw me calmly reading the same book, in the same spot, without missing a beat. Everyone in the class had seen me dive for my bag and promptly pull out the next book as soon as her back had turned. She did a double take, looked confused as all fuck as she looked at the one I was holding and the one she had confiscated on her desk. She went red in the face and fucking booked it back to my desk as fast as her heels would allow, and forcefully grabbed the second book. She marched back to her desk and spun around again to see me casually turning the page in the third copy of the book, with the class cackling at this point at her reaction. She stared but didn't say a word, she finally sat at her desk and pretended like nothing was wrong as she went about her shit.

End of class I picked up my books like normal, she refused to even look at me, was never a scapegoat for her control issues again.

**TL;DR Teacher tried to use me as a scapegoat for unruly classroom and would take away my personal books, I used her behavior to humiliate her in front of the class she could not control.**

2015-08-12 11:14:18+00:00,2379,My boyfriend puts a computer whizz wannabe in her place,oogapalooza,"My boyfriend is a QA Tech in a food factory, there's a lot of paperwork, a lot of procedure to follow and it's a lot of work. One of his coworkers is the laziest, most obnoxious person I've ever met, she strolls into work sometimes as much as 3 hours late while my boyfriend has to pick up her work. She constantly talks down to him, complains about him doing things differently to her and is just a general uppity bitch. 

This one day she's feeling especially full of herself, bragging about how she's so fantastic with computers, showing people gimpy little tricks she can do (I'm not techy but my boyfriend is). She came into work half an hour late as per, stood around moaning about having to work and after showing off her 'skills' threw the mouse at my boyfriend and announced ""I'm going on my break, you finish this."" He decides to make a show of her and changes the speed of the cursor so it's incredibly slow. When she comes back from her break she claims control of the computer.
 
A quote from my boyfriend:
""She started trying to use the mouse but the cursor was moving across the page so slow she started hitting the mouse on the table, growling and swearing at it all while I'm silently pissing myself in the doorway. I asked her what's up, can't she fix it? and she flipped the fuck out it was brilliant *hysterical laughter*"".

She left the room trying to find someone to fix it, in which time he sped it up to the max. When she came back with the manager he casually strolled out of the room and waited outside. As she's saying ""I don't know what's up with it, it won't work properly"" he hears the mouse go flying off the desk and a thud. She had pushed the mouse so vigorously expecting it to be slow, that when the cursor flew across the screen it took her by surprise and the mouse flew out of her hand, sending her into the desk and banging her knee.

As with any renovations you get junk that needs to be thrown out, so my parents decided to get one of those big containers that can be taken off and put onto the back of a truck (it's lifted onto the truck with a big mechanical type hook thing that's attached to the truck) to throw the trash in. (called a skip) 

We got the container pretty late into the evening after the construction people had left and therefore it was empty for the night. The next morning however, we woke up to the container being 1/3 full of random crap and a big ass queen sized bed that looked about 30 yours old. So of course my parents were pissed beyond belief that someone would just dump their trash into our container after WE paid for it and now we don't even get to use the whole thing. Now on to the revenge part of the story, as I was looking into the container staring in disbelief when I saw something sticking out of one of the trash bags, lo and behold it was a letter... With the perpetrators address. 

What do we do? Well, that night, me, my brother and my father decided to return to these people all the trash that they so graciously left in OUR container. But since they were inconsiderate enough to dump it in our container, we decided to dump it all over their driveway and in front of their cars so they could not be able to leave without cleaning up. 

Revenge is sweet and the neighbors did not even come and thank us for returning their stuff. How rude. 

TLDR: neighbors dumped their trash in our skip, gave it back to them... All over their driveway

2015-07-23 04:37:50+00:00,4271,I waited 6 months to get the last word..,ettell,"My (ex) boyfriend wanted to see a sold out show to the foo fighters this summer. Him and his friends failed desperately in getting their hands on any tickets. I, however, managed to snag 2. I waited until Christmas to give them to him and he was beyond excited. Jumping up and down excited. Fast forward 1.5 shitty months later and he dumped me 2 days before Valentines day after (literally) ignoring me for 3 weeks. The entire breakup blindsided me after 1.5 years together. I haven't talked to him since, but little does he know that I wasn't quite finished with him yet. My brother just so happens to be a huge foo fighters fan as well.....I logged into my ticket master account and suprise suprise, tickets can be transferred. So my brother is going to have the time of his life while my ex boyfriend gets turned around at doors. Sucks to suck.






UPDATE:
So, many of you wanted an update and here it is! 

This morning I received a text message from my brother letting me know that he could no longer make it to the concert, but that we would sell them instead. I figured, as the concert is tonight, that I would message my ex boyfriend and give him the chance to buy them or I would sell them to someone else. He never answered me so I posted them online. Contacted quickly by a few people as the show is sold out. I sold them to a nice girl who is taking her boyfriend for a fair price. Never thought about it after. Around supper tonight, about 5ish, my phone suddenly starts going crazy. I have a message from my friend saying my ex was texting her looking for my number. My dear friend, being the wonderful gal she is, actually gave it to him. About 39 seconds later, no less, I am suddenly getting an incoming call from him. Like hell I am answering. I let it go to voicemail. While I am listening to the voicemail he left me, (""I still want those tickets, please don't tell me you sold them, let me know""), my phone was getting multiple text messages. 6 messages in about 8 seconds from his friend. "" We drove all this way and paid for gas AND hotel, seriously?????"". Another friend- ""hey did you sell _______ concert tickets?? He wanted me to ask!"". Decided to enjoy my supper and then, maybe, I would answer them. Being the nice gal that I am, I told them that yes, I sold them. Last thing my ex says? ""Thanks for that."" So now they're in a city 2 hours away stuck in a hotel room for the night with nothing to do while the foos put on a slamming show.

Tl;dr- Still sucks to suck.

2015-07-18 09:33:46+00:00,2050,Pulled our high tipping table out from under a self-entitled waiter,Power-of-Erised,"So my fiancé and I have a date night every Thursday night to take advantage of our mutual days off. This particular night we decided to go out to eat at a popular restaurant with a red pepper as their logo and a catchy old advert about baby-back ribs. The place is not very crowded, it being a Thursday night, so we get seats and service quickly. Our drink order is taken by a sweet, friendly waitress who we'll call Maggie.  Maggie is cheerful, engaging, and has a Dr. Who lanyard around her neck. She and I share a few squees about the Doctor and Potter and general Fandom for a minute or two before she heads off to get our drinks. shortly after she brings us our drinks The Waiter comes by, let's christen him ... Walter. 

So, Walter proceeds to stand *behind* my fiancé (he and I are in a booth, facing each other) and speak only to me as he claims that this table is actually his and that Maggie is just a trainee, all the while with a creepy ass smile on his face. We find this a bit odd and annoying, but whatever, he heads off and we chat for another few minutes until Maggie returns to take our order. Several minutes later, Walter comes back, *stands with his back to my fiancé*, and asks if *I* need anything, completely ignoring my fiancé. Now we're getting really annoyed.  *We* tell him we're fine and off he goes. Then Maggie brings us our food, chats for a few seconds, leaves, then immediately returns with refills on our 3/4 empty drinks. She is the perfect waitress. 

However, we are now in a delema; if we leave a tip, it'll go to Walter (just to be sure, we confirm this with Maggie) but we don't want to gyp Maggie out of her well-earned tip. So we call over a waitress that is working a different section of tables and ask her to get the manager. When he arrives at our table we tell him that Maggie has been an excellent server and we would like to leave her a nice tip for her efforts but Walter has told us this table is his and has done absolutely fuckall otherwise (unless you count ignoring the other occupant of the table)

The Manager thanks us and goes over to the computer where they input the diners orders and changes the listed server of the table to Maggie. We now have no problem leaving a 50% tip ($20 on a $40 meal) and shoot smirks at a frowning Walter, being reamed out by the manager, as we leave. 

Next time don't be a dick and make the trainee do all the work for none of the profits. Also, when there's two people at a table; talk to *both* of them.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/3dq1fi/pulled_our_high_tipping_table_out_from_under_a/,pettyrevenge,355,

My 21st birthday was on Thursday this past week. But I'm working an internship in Florida (I'm from California) and I needed to work early the next morning. So I was just going to buy a 6 pack and go home and have a nice night in. So I go into this liquor store on my birthday and put a 6 pack at the check out counter. The guy asks for my ID and I proudly give it to him because hey I don't get a first legal purchase any other day except today. He looks at it and then says some words you never want to here:

""I'm sorry. I can't let you purchase this beer.""

I'm really confused. It's my 21st birthday. I should be able to buy this. I ask him why and he tells me I have to wait until midnight (which would be Friday, the day AFTER my birthday). I'm from California and don't know Florida drinking laws and so I leave in defeat. Later I'm at a bar (who did serve me) and ask them about this situation. They told me this guy was basically just being a dick for some reason and that there's no law that says I can't be served on my 21st birthday. Well this got me angry and I came up with a plan.

This is where the vengeance comes in. The next day after work, I go to that same liquor store. I put 3 six packs on the counter along with 2 fifths and a handle. He asks for my ID again and he approves that I am officially 21 now (somehow that 24 hours made a difference) and starts scanning my items. When he tells me the total, I tell him:

""Actually, can you take this six pack off. That's a little too much for me.""

He takes it off and tells me my new total. I do this for every god damn item I put up there. And then I just walk out. No explanation. No reason why. But he knew why.

They took the exit directly in front of me which was a loop to an overpass with a lane to go straight and a lane to bear right at the end of the overpass. I *just so happen* to be taking this exit as well. And as luck would have it, white suv is between two other cars in the straight on lane (window still rolled down), while I need to turn right.

I slow down so I'll pass right by their car just as their light turns green and when I pass by I scream as loudly as I fucking can directly into their window while I rolled past.

This one guy I had to mic up very recently was incredibly short tempered and snappy with me for no real reason other than he was nervous. I'm fine with that, I'm used to dealing with rude people, I actually take a weird satisfaction in turning them around and turning them into happy and calm people by reassuring them and generally doing a good job, but this guy was different.

He was a fat bloke, with bright pink skin as a result of his high blood pressure. He waddled over to my desk at the back of the room, breathing heavily with his hand outstretched and barked:

*""Give me a microphone!""* 

I wasn't gonna like this guy. I calmly smiled and said *no problem* as I stood to mic him up.

*""I SAID, give me a microphone NOW!""*

Oops, this guy can go fuck himself. So I mic him up, assure him his presentation is ready when he interrupts me and says:

*""I want you to turn me up REALLY loud!""*

*""I think if we turn up the PA anymore it might be a little uncomfortable for the audien-""*

*""I wasn't asking your opinion, I was telling you to turn me up!""*

I just looked at him, unconsciously giving him a death stare. I work for myself so I don't give a fuck, you pink grenade. He walks up to the lectern as he is introduced.

I turn him up on the mixer, as loud as it can go without feedback, looking at his perfectly-punch able oval face, when something amazing happens. He covers his mouth as he lets out a small cough, and as he does so, he does the wettest, dribbly-est sounding fart I've ever heard, and because the microphone was turned up so loud, it was amplified 1000x and straight into the ears and brains of everyone in the entire room.

Silence. He stands, baffled at how his entire life has led him to this moment, he turns even redder and his voice begins to shake. Speaking of shaking, my whole body is trembling, trying to keep my explosive laughter unseen beneath the surface.

At the end, he walked all the way to the back of the room, shamed, and sheepishly thanked me.

It's ~~Spring~~Summer cleaning time and I found the cheapest carpet cleaner rental in my area which is $15 for 24hours. Plenty of time for my small little place. But hold up, the store policy states that I'm ""Required"" to purchase their Carpet cleaner solution with the rental to make sure I use the correct product.  

Fine, whatever.. I'll just get a small bottle because hey... my carpet space small. Only problem is, ALL of the carpet cleaning solutions from small to medium size bottles are sold out. The dust on the shelf tells me they've been sold out for quite some time too. The only bottles left are the industrial sized gallon jugs of the Oxyclean expensive stuff. WTF? Restock much?

The sales clerk and I come to verbal blows because I'm not spending $35 on 120 oz of carpet cleaning solution. The MOD finally appears and is less than helpful. Has no intention of being understandable or reasonable. I attempt to compromise by going to another store of theirs 2 miles away to pick up the correct size solution if they have it on hand.  

No, he is having none of it. I asked to speak to corporate and I'm given one of their phones to call.  While on hold, I start googling DIY Carpet cleaning solution and find an ULTRA CHEAP alternative on the top search.  In fact, the store that I was at had 2 of the 4  ingredients right there for $1.00 each.  I speak to a corporate official and its their policy that I must purchase solution with the rental for insurance reasons. WTF? seriously? I then asked what the return policy was on unused product that I purchase that has a receipt.  The official said I could return all unopened/unused product within XX amount of days.  He even caught on to what I was implying but policy is policy.  

I hang up, head down a few aisles, pick up the 2 ingredients that I needed, return to the counter and complete the transaction.  

&gt;$15 Machine rental   
&gt;$35 Tub of solution   
&gt;$1 Household cleaner  
&gt;$1 Oxyclean microbox. 

I headed home and quickly mixed the Laundry detergent and softener I had already, added the Household cleaner and scoop of Oxyclean. Single best carpet cleaner I've ever used hands down! Been renting machines for years and I was impressed at how good this solution was. Used about 8-10 oz of the DIY solution with enough left over for next time around.  

I finished in about 2 hours and loaded up the machine.  As I returned the rental, I asked that the Carpet Solution be credited back as well. The same MOD I spoke too not hours ago threw a major hissy-fit saying that I'm NOT allowed to return the product.  Told him to dial the same corporate official I spoke with. 

I told him flat out that had he restocked, I would have gladly purchased and used the smaller bottle.  The look on his face as he was forced to return the solution was all the victory I needed.  That's what you get for pulling this purchase policy scam and not restocking normal inventory. 

**TL:DR - Store Manager enforces a Policy that requires me to purchase expensive cleaning solution with my machine rental. I created a DIY cleaning solution that was far superior and I returned the unopened bottle to a scowling manager. His scam didn't work.** 

*Edit: I'm including the link to the DIY solution by popular request. I made some recommended changes to the Household cleaner add-in but otherwise its untouched from what I used*

2015-06-25 04:07:21+00:00,2095,So here's the story of my wedding petty revenge.,talesofakat,"My husband and I married in March. This is the story of my petty revenge on his sister (hereafter referred to as BSIL for Bitch Sister-In-Law), who tried to ruin our wedding day with her self-centered bullshit. 

The Wedding Day Dramatics:

BSIL almost refused to wear her bridesmaid dress because ""it wasn't special enough"" despite helping to pick it out (read: she bullied the other girls until they agreed with the dress she liked best).

BSIL made one of the other bridesmaids, Barbie, cry by telling her she looked fat in her dress (Barbie is a recovered anorexic who was feeling a little more sensitive at the time due to her pregnancy just starting to show). 

BSIL tried to break into the closing prayer of our ceremony to put in her own two cents (she pulled a sweaty note card out from who knows where; thankfully our minister was a pro and shut that down). 

BSIL complained about the food despite going back for thirds. 

BSIL criticized the music playlist my husband and I picked out (while the dance floor was packed with people having fun). 

And finally...BSIL got really trashed, stole my bouquet before the toss and marched up to her Poor Slob of a boyfriend to loudly present him with an ultimatum: Propose to her now or breakup forever. PS caved and he and BSIL got engaged...at the wedding.

Despite all that, our wedding day was an absolute blast. No one gave credence to her antics because everyone was having fun and who really cares about anyone but the bride and groom anyway?

SO.

BSIL is having a Fancy Black-Tie New Year's Wedding. And I'm NOT a bridesmaid (YIPPEE)!

She asked my husband to be one of PS's groomsmen, then looked at me in a rather deliberate manner and said, ""Ok, so that's it. Wedding party is all figured out.""

That was a month ago. I found out through the family grapevine that the reason I'm not a bridesmaid is because she's worried I'll ""intentionally steal all the attention and/or ruin things."" Everyone finds this very confusing.

My husband (who isn't all that close to BSIL for obvious reasons ) has a different theory: BSIL's entire bridesmaid party is made up of women who are in some way less attractive than her. According to him, BSIL is just plain afraid I'll somehow outshine her. The bride. On her wedding day. A day when literally every eye will be on her, and only her (and maybe the groom).

My petty revenge: since I'm not a bridesmaid, BSIL can't force me into the ugly royal blue dress she's chosen for her bridal party. I can choose whatever I want.

So I bought a $350 (on sale for $80!!) metallic silver, form-hugging, floor-length evening gown with a not-quite-daring slit up to the thigh. I shot off a photo to my mother-in-law (I have no idea how that wonderful woman managed to birth someone like BSIL) to ask what she thought. She loves it; it's perfectly in line with the dress code for BSIL's formal New Year's extravaganza. 

No one will look at me twice in it (except for maybe my husband), and I won't actually be distracting from BSIL's Special Day.

But thanks to her own weirdly-focused-on-me neurosis...BSIL doesn't realize that.

The photo finally made its way to BSIL. My phone is blowing up. about 20 texts and three voicemails so far. Husband's phone is the feeling the same hurt. 

I think this may kill her.

YIPPEE!

EDIT: On my cell, sorry for any Engrish issues. Thanks so much for your support! I will definitely upload my fabulous silver dress photos when I get home from work tonight. For the texts...I'd rather not share that level of filth. As much as I know all you fellow petty-revengers would enjoy it, some of it's personal family issues (as you can imagine, she's caused her share of family issues that she blames on everyone else).

The voicemails though? The 3rd on on my husband's phone was just her screaming.

EDIT 2: Still at work. Give me another hour :)

2015-06-16 16:52:41+00:00,3668,Might I inquire as to your return policy then..,dguv22,"So about a week ago I find myself in downtown Austin visiting my soon to be married best friend who has asked me to be the best man.  We have plans to rent a beach house and everyone chipped in about $200 to buy alcohol for the bachelor party.  

I had been procrastinating and was running out of time.  I saw this sushi restaurant downtown and thought, ""I'll park next door in this liquor store's parking lot, by all the alcohol for the trip and then surely they'll let me park there and go eat lunch""

I ring up $1245 worth of scotch, bourbon, vodka and beer and then proceed to pay. The old man at the counter looked like he had the personality of a celery stick.  When I got my reciept and everything was loaded into about 6 cardboard boxes I asked him, ""hey man, do you mind if I stay parked here for about 30 minutes while I run next door and get lunch?""  He looked at me over the boxes of all this liquor and flatly said, ""no, unless you're just getting it to go and you'll be back in five minutes or less, I'll tow you""  

I looked him dead in the eyes and said, ""might I inquire as to your return policy then?""  

He looked at me confused, as if he didn't understand the question.  ""I said, I'd like all of my money back sir"".  that's when it clicked and he tried to offer the parking spot to me like I had initially requested seeing $1245 going up in smoke.  No Dice jack! I made him painstakingly rescan everything while I stared him down.  

TLDR; buy $1245 worth of liquor, ask manager to use parking spot to grab lunch next door, he refuses, I return all the alcohol and ask for my money back.

Guess we're even.,accaris,"Some folks decided to shovel their huge load of laundry into the same dryer as mine at the laundry mat. This is a laundry mat with a Publix right next door, so I went to do some shopping and came back to a dryer that I had paid $2 for packed with not only MY clothes, but a bunch of sheets and towels. The dryer was so packed it could barely spin. There's no way the $2 I put in would have been enough to do the job, but they thought they could get a free dry. They thought it would be done by the time I got back. They were wrong.

I waited until the dryer was done, casually packed all of my clothes AND their clothes into my laundry bag, and went home.

Threw away everything of theirs but a few towels, which looked like stolen hotel towels anyway. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/39l1j3/you_wanted_a_free_dry_i_wanted_some_free_towels/,pettyrevenge,143,

He was promoted based on longevity, not merit or work ethic. He comes in too stoned to balance a drawer, avoids customer interaction at all costs (even though part of his job is customer service), has a holier-than-thou attitude with everyone, and is generally just a lazy pos.

Anyway, my day shift crew and I finished our closing work ten minutes early, so I asked him to check us out so we could leave (no customers in the store either). He takes his sweet time walking around and checking everything, and then, because he didn't want to have to help any potential customers for as long as possible, tells us that we have to wait ten minutes to leave.

Earlier, even though it isn't part of my closing work, I had gone through all six cash registers and faced all the bills, clipped the $20s in stacks of $500 to make counting easier for him at the end of the night, and clipped all the credit card receipts from each drawer so everything would be neat for him. I had nothing to do for those last ten minutes, so I went through each and every drawer, unclipped the stacks and receipts, and unfaced all the bills. So hopefully he didn't get to leave ten minutes early either!

2015-06-05 00:36:21+00:00,2010,Your daughter is too precious to walk through a parking lot? Guess you can't leave.,pianoman99a,"On mobile, sorry for anything weird.  Also kinda wordy.

Mostly a spectator to this one, but still helped out.  At my high school (grades 9-12), there is a little area in one of the parking lots for busses, and for parents to pick up and drop off kids, although waiting there for any period of time is not allowed.  Unfortunately, lots of parents can't bear to see their poor little children walk through the parking lot, so they will wait in this spot for anywhere up to 15 to 20 minutes.

So, one day, I'm in the bus after a volleyball game, and we pull into the parking lot.  There are 3 cars in the drop off area, and it needs to be completely clear for the bus to fit in.  Third car drives away, and kids are getting into first car.  Second car, with no kid to be seen, turns off car and sits and waits.  Our bus driver honks once, and the driver just sits there.  Honks again.  Driver looks over, then looks back forward.  Honks for 20 seconds straight.  At this point, the driver gets out of his car, and walks away.  So, the bus driver pulls up a little more, making it so the second car can't move until the first one leaves.  We start getting off, and the driver comes back with his daughter and waits angrily for the first car to leave.  Eventually it does, but now driver can't leave because we are walking in front of him.  So he hits his horn, and holds it.  I see my opportunity, and make sure I am the last one off the bus.  As I get off, whoops!  Dropped my bag.  And oh, my shoes look kinda loose, better retie them.  Oh, did I leave something?  I thought for a few seconds.  No.  I finally walk off.  The driver finally lets up on the horn, and angrily drives off.  Asshole.

2015-06-03 13:59:23+00:00,3168,To my boss - I can see this eating you alive,[deleted],"My boss (we'll call him Steve) is one of those guys who's always attached to his email. Whether he's at his desk or answering them from his phone, he will stop the conversation immediately and read the email. No warning. The sound will go off, he'll stop mid-sentence, read and reply to every email. This annoys me. A lot. While going over a very important project (well into the $40-$50 million dollar range and long-term), I'm briefing him on talking points and covering the power point on the projector. A few slides in, he gets an email.  Immediately Steve pulls out his phone and begins reading and replying. I've dealt with this for years, and this is where the revenge begins. I'm on slide 6, and while he's buried in his phone, I progress the slide to 13 and patiently wait for him to end. He looks up, oblivious to my trickery. Mind you, he has to present this within a few hours to top-tier business management, and this a project that we've been working on for months. I finish briefing him on the rest of the slides, we take lunch, and eventually the guests arrive for their briefing. Steve's taking charge of the meeting, and I retreat to my office, where I can still clearly watch the presentation but don't have to participate. 

Steve's hob-knobbing, talking our guests up, laughing and joking. As he's talking to one particular VP, he gets an email, and in normal shit-lord fashion, he stops mid conversation and reads it. The VP did not like this, not one bit. He interrupts Steve's email reply with a hand wave and a, ""let's continue."" This is where I get my second idea for revenge.

Eventually Steve gets to the power point presentation, yammering on like he's the one who spent all the time on the fancy fly-in's, formatting, research, etc... Until he gets to slide 7. I can see him pause, break his jovial manner, and begins reading word for word what's on the slide. He's no longer chipper and poised, he's floundering. Little does Steve know that I'm about to launch an email war on his psyche that he is ill prepared for. See, since I've been in my office, I've been collecting all the emails that came in that needed replies, drafted the replies, and have them sitting on my desktop. I've CC'd Steve to every one of them, because I'm just that good of an employee. As he skips to the next slide, I send the first email. I hear his phone jingle. He pauses and instinctively reaches for his phone, throwing him off his presentation. He looks around, and then continues. A minute later, I send the next email, then after a short pause, the next... And the next... I can see him sweating bullets, his brain imagining some catastrophic failure somewhere in our building, in shipping, in product sourcing, etc... But he can't check his emails without breaking from the presentation and pissing off the executives.

It's still going on. I have about 8 more emails to send, and he has about a hour until he'll be able to slink away and cower over his phone like Gollum holding the one ring.

I'm glad I went to work today. 

**Edit:** Steve is an over-the-top kind of guy, he wants to know everything. It's common for me to CC him on important emails. He has not caught on yet. I also fixed the spelling of ""Gollum.""

**Update:** I just made myself a bagel with cream cheese. It was delicious. The meeting is still progressing. I've sent a few more emails, and have drafted more. 

**Update 2:** The power point is finished, and I've setup the next part of the program, the video conference. No one's taken a break yet... Except Steve. He had to go to the bathroom, and was in there for at least 10 minutes. He responded to two of my emails.

**Update 3:** Steve came into the office to see if I can run for some food for everyone. I told him I was really bogged down with emails, but I'm sure I can find some time.

**Update 4:** I've sent 57 emails to him today, only 1 directly. I've rescheduled the janitorial service, which was 4 emails alone, plus their responses. I've sent an email to the entire staff and local regional team (over 100 people), requesting computer information for a software integration project and instructed everyone to email myself and Steve with their results.

**Update 5:** Holy end of the world, Steve's phone died and he forgot his charger. I heard him banging around his office, let out an exasperated sigh, and then head for mine. I quickly plugged in my company phone. Sure enough, he wants to borrow my charger. ""Sorry Steve, my phone's almost dead and I have a conference call in 20 minutes."" The look on his face and the air of defeat around him is palpable. I think he's going into withdrawal. He's honestly pulled his phone from his holster three or four times, either to make sure it was really dead, or because he's feeling phantom vibration notifications.

2015-06-01 15:30:14+00:00,2040,An ex-girlfriend crushed me without explanation,virogar,"Preamble: So a few years ago, I dated this wonderful girl. She was beautiful, we shared tons of interests, she was my best friend, we were looking at apartments together, the whole 9 yards. We even discussed the possibility of having kids together (a major first for me). The first time we celebrated her birthday, I hit a home run. She had lost her grandmother a few years priors to Alzheimers-related complications, its a disease that runs in her family and she's horrified by it. We chatted before she went to bed the night before her birthday and after she tucked in, I went online and made a sizable donation to the local Alzheimer's fund in her name and in memory to her grandmother. She called me from work happy/angry the next morning because she cried at her desk when she checked her e-mail in front of her coworkers. She said it was the kindest gift she'd ever received. 

Fast forward a year, she ends things quite abruptly, and rudely without any warning, and in the months following refuses to speak to me to provide any form of closure. I also learned from friends that she started living with a new boyfriend within months after we ended. I was obviously devastated by this for a while, but then her birthday came up. I decided that I still loved the idea of donating to Alzheimers, even if I wasn't dating her anymore. 

That being said, I've still done the donation in her name for the past 2 years, and she's gotten the email every year since.

She acted like this to me and most of the girls I worked with.  She was sweet as pie to my male co-workers, though, go figure.

Anyway, one day she taped a typewritten sheet of paper to the wall filled with a bunch of new rules regarding point-of-sale behavior.  It was riddled with typos.

Any way! This lady calls this morning and wants a delivery. Naturally, I ask for her name and her address. She refuses to tell me this information, insisting I just look it up in our computer by her phone number. Now, we can do this, sure, but the system is far from perfect and half the time the info I find isn't correct. 

After some back and forth about this she *finally* gives me the information. Now, to the order. She refuses to tell me what she wants! She says, ""It's just easier to look up what I had last time.."" Alright people, in no way is this easier. I plead with her to just give me her order, but to no avail. 

I'm fed up with her at this point. I look up her last order and it was just a $1.99 garlic bread. I tell her that we can't even deliver something that small, and she's annoyed because that's not even what she wants to order! AHG!

So I finally squeeze her damn order out of her. It's 20 Garlic Wings. 20. F'in. Garlic Wings. What is so hard about just saying 20 garlic wings to the guy taking your order? Seriously?

I also have an uncanny memory.  Random kids in my classes passing in the hallway can walk up and say ""What did I get on my test?"" and I can usually tell them their exact grade.  One day I passed back tests in class, and a boy who made a 95 came up and said, ""You marked one wrong that was right.""  And sure enough, there was the right answer on the paper.  But I swear I *remembered* that he had put a different answer.  And of course I could see that it had been erased and changed.  But I'm human--I could have made a mistake; he could have changed it before he handed it in, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and changed his grade to 100.  The next quiz we took, same thing.  He walks up with a 95, saying, ""you counted one wrong that was right.""  Now seriously, what are the mathematical odds that the exact same thing happened again, to the exact same kid?  And I'm pretty accurate in my marking.  I could even see the eraser crumbs on his paper from where he had changed the answer!  I knew the little cheater was trying to put one over on me again.  So I said, ""I really don't remember this answer being here when I marked your paper.""  He said, ""I promise, Ms. Skizethelimit, I really had this answer.""  I said, ""Are you SURE?""  He put on the sad puppy face and said, ""Yes, I promise.""  I said, ""Well, in that case, I'm sure it will be the same on this (reaching into desk) photocopy I made of your test before I handed them back.""  Yes, I did photocopy that little sneak's quiz before I handed it back!  As I compared the two papers, the river of tears began as he knew he'd been caught.  Not only did he have to keep that 95, I took 5 points back off the previous test, too.  Take that, sucker!  And don't pull that crap on me again!

Edit--Just a little note that teaching philosophy/grading has changed pretty radically these days and grades are meant to be a reflection of actual ability in the subject area; not a reflection of values or ethics.  So I really would not be at liberty to give a kid a zero when he made a 95 (not saying I agree with that--just stating the rules that teachers are bound by)  I didn't say he wasn't punished; just not by me.  I had a conference with his parents and showed them the tests.  He's really a nice, polite, never any trouble kind of kid...just a little too driven to perfection.  I believe they grounded him.

I'd gone mistakenly during Ironman week, and parking spaces were scarce, but luckily I'd gotten one right on the front, paid for an hour and went for a run with my two dogs. 

On the way back I cross over the road to go back to the car park. In Clearwater they have a lot of these crosswalks that the traffic has to yield to. Start crossing, half way accross when black Lexus suv roars up out of nowhere, clearly breaking speed limit, blasts on horn, middle aged bitch within car starts yelling obscenities, I point to sign of person crossing, more obscenities before bitch queen speeds off.

Get to my car, get the dogs in the back and start to give them a drink while sitting in the open trunk, notice bitch queen in her Lexus waiting about 20 feet from me(I'm in a really good space, right near the beach) she's obviously waiting for me to move, and I would have taken about a minute to water my mutts and drive away to give up the space, but one minute is too long for bitch queen.

I close the trunk, and start to head back to the car and I hear a voice, a whiny ""I'm not used to people telling me no"" voice: 

*""Hey, HEY! I'm waiting here, are you going to be much longer?""* 

Okay you cunt, I was going, but now...check my ticket, 10 minutes left...

*""I'll be gone in a few...""* I say....

*""well are you going to the beach or what, what are you doing?""* is the reply...

*""I'll be done....when I'm done""*... I say back.

bitch queen speeds off with tires screeching round the car park, to the attendant, and starts bitching to him, arms waving out of the window, the works, clearly upset. He just shrugs his shoulders as if 'nothing I can do'. Bitch drives out of car park.

In meantime another car has pulled in behind me, I signal to say I'm leaving and they can have my spot, and drive away, and the sweet part is I see bitch drive back around into the lot only to see a fresh car parked where I was.

2015-05-14 21:52:55+00:00,2758,Don't be a dick to Apple.,Matchboxx,"Apple Stores aren't your typical retail store. We have revered customer service, but sometimes customers have unreasonable expectations (why should *I* have to pay to get my screen fixed...Apple made the glass too thin!) and aren't happy with our service. So they either call AppleCare or write to the BBB where Executive Relations will then give them basically anything they want.

Recently, a customer came in wanting to get the screen replaced on his iPhone 5S. The catch to screen replacements is that a new screen will be shaped like a new phone - meaning, if the phone enclosure itself got dented, a new screen won't fit in properly, and we have to replace the entire phone for a much higher cost. We're not rated on service revenue, so we have no motivation to lie to you...but this customer didn't believe that.

I inform him that two sizable dents on the side of the phone will make it impossible for a new screen to go on, so we'll have to replace the whole device. He goes into a frustrated tirade about how we should at least *try* a screen (but if it fails, you've wasted $129) and that he shouldn't have to pay if it fails (if we waste a part and labor on you after informing you this won't work, yes, you should). 

He asks for my manager, who is 6 months pregnant. She calmly corroborates my statement that the repair won't be possible with the dents and that his only option would be a full device swap. He retaliates, ""You've got to be the worst bitch I've ever met."" (Both of us were being rather nice and empathetic about it.) She scowls and says ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store"" to which he responds, ""*Why don't you go lose some weight, fatty.*""

So I decide to write up non-repair notes on his account about that appointment... I saved onto his profile notes that stated our interaction and how he responded, how he called my pregnant manager a bitch and told her to lose weight. I implored Executive Relations to not throw us under the bus and to refuse this customer anything besides the originally quoted service.

Sure enough, 2 days later, I checked his profile again out of curiosity. He had contacted a tier 3 AppleCare supervisor, and the notes merely stated ""*Read notes from technician at Apple Retail Store. Informed customer his business would be more welcomed at Samsung.*""

2015-05-06 12:44:13+00:00,2873,I forced my roommate to move.,Morgan_Sloat,"Well, more specifically, he was forced to find a new place after the lease ended because he wasn't paying attention.

This was a number of years ago, just after college. I'd rented a two bedroom apartment with a friend of a friend type, since we were both staying in the same town after college. I planned it to only be temporary, and this was the case. Has things gone amicably, I'd never have done what I did.

The guy, however, turned out to be a roommate from hell.

He was always late in getting his share of the rent and utilities to me, sometimes as much as two weeks after constant badgering. All of the utilities were in my name, and I didn't want my credit score to get fucked up for non-payment. 

He never cleaned in any way. The bastard never took out the trash or recycling, he only did his dishes when absolutely pressed, could never be bothered to even touch the vacuum, and so on. I had conversations with him about sharing the workload, and was dismissed. The asshole would even leave cookware with food in it after using it.

I didn't want the place Adrian Monk levels of clean. At the very least, I wanted ""women won't vomit in disgust and then run in horror"".

Nope. This jackass was having none of that. He also would blast the TV or music at all hours, even 2am.

I was counting down the days until the end of the lease. When the lease renewal came, my idea for revenge sprung into my mind.

When he was distracted by a particularly intense/close baseball game, I got him to sign it. I just said ""hey, man, the lease renewal came, you need to sign this."" he signed without looking at it at all, and said ""now fuck off I'm watching the game.""

Well, he probably should have checked the document he signed, since I had marked the box stating that we would not be renewing the lease and would be out at the end of the month. I mailed it in immediately. 

I already had plans to move out of state, and had pretty much locked down lodging in my new area.

Over the course of the month, I slowly moved everything of mine out of the apartment into a storage unit. The lease ended on Sunday evening, and he worked weekends and then went out to the bar right after work. So on Friday the 29th, I rented a bigass U-Haul, loaded much of the storage unit stuff, and parked it somewhere safe. On Saturday the 30th, I got some help to move the rest of everything that I owned outright: Furniture, the living room TV, and every last goddamn thing in the kitchen.

I had the truck loaded and I hit the road, headed several states away.

The fucker came home to an empty apartment and a photocopy of the agreement that we'd be out by 11:59pm on the 31st of the month. 

Oh. I'd also cancelled all of the utilities, since they were in my name. Effective the 31st.

I overslept until 8:15 and realize I am going to be late for my 9 am meeting I have (normally I just work from home, when I work late, but this meeting required me to be there in person).  So I get ready as quick as possible and decide to request an Uber.  There is a surge pricing of 1.5x (to those who don't know, surge pricing occurs during peak times and causes your fare to multiplied by the amount shown).   So, 1.5x is acceptable to me and I click request.   Awesome, the driver is 10 minutes out.   

Not one minute out and the driver had to cancel.   So I click request again and now the surge multiplier has jumped to 2.1.   That sucks, but I need to be at this meeting, so I accept again.  Well guess what driver I got again? The same one who ""had to cancel"".  Oh so you think you can just cancel on me and get more money.  Wrong!

At this point a taxi will be the same price,  so I call one up and they can be at my place in 10 mins.   Since you can track the location of the Uber driver on the app, I wait until he is less than a mile out and cancel the request.   My taxi then arrives 5 mins later.   Feels good man.

I have a shit eating grin all the way to work and end up getting to my meeting on time.

TL;DR - Uber driver canceled on me to get more money.  So I cancel on him just close enough to my place.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/34y9uu/im_sorry_i_had_to_cancel_too/,pettyrevenge,190,

I did the whole procedure, registered my tickets, sent my luggage to be wrapped and stood still in the corner. Now, this is important: I was dressed with a white t-shirt and a black pair of pants, looking really formal, so I looked like someone from the airport staff, specially because I was standing close to the airport map, staring at nothing waiting for my flight. I heard a commotion in the hall next to the check-in area, looked there and then I saw him: the asshole. Dude was giving everyone in the airport - staff and passengers - a very hard time, demanding priority in the check in service and making a huge scene. Apparently, he was too wealthy to just wait in line like everyone else. He screamed so much, one of the staff girls actually cried. I heard he was trying to get a flight from Curitiba to Campinas (two cities in Brazil), which was exactly the flight I was in. So I saw an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to avenge the poor girl and the rest of the staff: I went to the departure section and just stood still next to the place where you go to board the planes, with those ""tubes"" that connect the bulding to the planes. [This](http://i.imgur.com/TKSNoQg.jpg) is what I mean, I don't know if USA airports have this kind of stuff.

Anyway, I stood in the long corridor, and when he came close to me, I asked him ""Are you sir flying to Campinas or to Rio de Janeiro?""

""Campinas"" he said in that disgusting voice.

""That way"" I pointed to one of the tunnels entrance to my left.

If he made past this point in the building, it meant that somebody already checked his ID and ticket. So nobody would question him when he got into the plane I pointed, which means that he was not  going to Campinas. Actually, God knows where he might have ended up if he didn't realize he was in the wrong plane.

TL;DR: Dude was being rude and violent in the airport, redirected him to the wrong plane to teach him a lesson

So I'm a high school senior and I work at my local movie theater. I get a lot of rude customers, and for the most part I let it roll off my back, but for some reason this one really got me. Anyways, I'm walking down the
hallway, broom and dustpan in hand, sweeping up popcorn. This group of about 5 kids, each probably like 15-16 years old, approaches me. As they pass me, the girl in the middle grabs a handful of popcorn and throws it at
my feet saying: ""you missed one"" and then walks away laughing like a fucking bitch. 


As far as rudeness goes this wasn't even that bad. I've had people scream in my face or just straight up insult me. Maybe it was just that this was my 7th hour of that shift, but I was really fucking angry (on the inside,
I didn't give the little bitch a reaction, which I'm sure she was hoping for).


I can tell by the direction that they're walking that they're going to see ""Unfriended,"" a shitty horror movie, but more importantly, rated R. Normally I don't really give a shit if kids sneak into movies, I'll only ask for tickets
if my manager asks me to or is watching. Today however, I felt extra motivated to go check tickets so I turn around and walk quickly over to the auditorium's door (luckily the group was walking slow). I stand there, arms crossed, while
one of the kids reaches for the door. They only open it about an inch before I push it closed and say ""tickets and ID, please.""


I get the usual fumbling around in purses, huffing and complaining from these little shits but I hold strong. Eventually after like 3 minutes of them trying to make excuses they pull out their Paul Blart Mall Cop tickets, like 
I'm actually going to let them in, LOL. 


As they turn around to leave, I put on the biggest, customer-satisfaction smile I can make and say: ""enjoy Paul Blart!"" I then guard that movie for the next hour, just to make sure they didn't come back.

2015-04-18 17:27:59+00:00,2418,I waited more than a decade. Best served cold and all that.,Greatfreedom,"I had a friend in high school whose mother was one of the most clear-cut nasty, judgmental and snappy people I've ever had reason to know. All about appearances, she was one of those people who, had she been describing someone *else*, would have been ""trying to step above their station"".

She was particularly hounding when it came to any kind of fun, and repeatedly disparaged people who drank alcohol as drunkards and thieves. This being Australia, it was like she was constantly trying too hard to channel the worst of stereotypical upper class England. For years through school I dreaded having anything to do with her, and sixteen year old me with all the hangups sixteen year old me had didn't cope very well with it, nor did my friend.

So something like fifteen years later I hadn't seen much of my friend or his mother at all and I'm standing in Grace Bros looking at kitchenware. I notice her not too far from me. She coughs and tries to get my attention and I do *not* want to give her the time of day. I want her to know I don't find her worth acknowledging.

""Will you pay attention and help, or shall I fetch someone above you?"". Oh… oh too much joy. **She doesn't recognise me. She thinks I work there**.

I ignored her, she comes over to me, I looked her up and down and sniffed in loudly &amp; said ""Uhngh. You smell like you haven't washed in a *week*. Have you been *drinking?*"" and the look on her face was prime unadulterated embarrassment. I couldn't have picked a more pointed put-down of someone who had been so nasty to me and my friend for so long.

About 13 years ago, a bunch of co-workers and I got together for a night of bowling and drinking. I was 20, so I was sober. Around 11pm, I decided to call it a night. 

This particular alley was about the only hang out for teens in the area, and on weekend nights starting at 11:30 they had teen night. $10 for unlimited bowling, shoes, and drinks. So a lot of kids went there, and if you wanted a lane, you got there early. So the parking lot became the ""preparty."" Especially when the nights were nice.

Anyway, I'm going out to my car on this warm evening, to find half a dozen teens sitting on or leaning heavily on people's cars. One of my pet peeves, but not my car, and I have no proof it's not theirs either.

Until I look at my car. The hood of my new car. It was a used car, with 1 previous old lady owner. We called it the cream puff. A Honda Civic, not fancy, but in perfect shape and only 2 years old. There was a boy and a girl on it. Not just sitting on my hood mind you, but full on making out. He was laying on the windshield, and she was straddling him. Dry humping and all. 

Now, I wasn't that much older than them. I get hormones and such. But you don't just dry fuck on a car that doesn't belong to you. So, I did what any responsible adult would do. 

I turned around and got everyone who was around me to come watch. I grabbed a couple friends. This grabbed the crowd of teens' attention, who started watching what I was doing. Then, I pushed the panic button on the alarm. 

They started swearing, he jumped up, knocking her to her ass onto the gravel. He rolled over and landed in a bush. They yelled a bit about what the fuck, but eventually they took off. I can't imagine he got anymore play that night, his ego and her ass were probably too bruised.

2015-04-16 11:34:58+00:00,2536,"Use a technicality on me, you better believe I'll return the favour.",theboybuck,"Long time reader, first time poster.

So my fiancée and I recently made the big move and got a house, we were renting previously. Now in Scotland, where we live, there is a law that says taking admin fees for a lease is illegal and this was clarified in 2012 so a lot of people were writing to their landlords/letting agents requesting that these illegal fees be reimbursed.

I was one such tenant, however as I had paid this in cash and couldn't trace the transaction my letting agents simply responded, that they would be happy to refund me but without a receipt or bank transfer number there was nothing they could do ""no paperwork, no money I'm afraid. You could just be claiming against anything otherwise"".

I admitted defeat as it was only £100 and I had already put it aside as a loss when I paid it. But I was however annoyed by it.

So it comes time for us to move out, around about the time I took over the lease in 2012 when the rental act Scotland was clarified they also introduced the deposit protection schemes. This meant that your deposit had to be placed with a third party to be protected and then released when both parties agreed to a split of the money (for damaged etc.).  My letting agents had already explained that they would be taking a large chunk of my deposit to repair the wear and tear of the carpets.
As I was arranging the move out and getting the details for the deposit scheme I requested an inventory of the flat to ensure that everything would be returned how it was and try to get as much of my deposit that was remaining after they took their slice for carpet repair.

They sent me an inventory.

It did not have my name on it, nor the date that I had taken on the lease.

It was from two years previously and named the girls that I had taken the lease over from, in their laziness the letting agents had just transferred the tenancy over to me without doing an inventory check.

I brought this to their attention and asked them to supply an inventory check with my name and details of the tenancy taken at my time of moving in. They were unable to, I pointed out that should I challenge their request for carpet repair money out of the deposit that they had no paperwork to back their claim that the carpets were not already worn and damaged before I moved in.

They tried to brush the matter aside and stated that it was a “Technicality”.

I wrote several e-mails explaining that I would be claiming all of my deposit back as the letting agents was not in possession of the correct paperwork to claim anything. I won because ""no paperwork, no money I'm afraid. You could just be claiming against anything otherwise"".

I am now awaiting the bank transfer of every penny to appear in my account within the next 5 working days.

TL:DR Letting agents screwed me on an illegal charge and wouldn’t give it back on a technicality, I used the same technicality to get all of my deposit back that was 1000% more than the initial charge.

I'm at a christening for one of my nephews and its reception is taking place at a hotel my in-laws booked. We get there and there happens to be some other event going on for an Orthodox Jewish family.  Trouble starts as soon as we pull into the parking lot with three 4- or 5-year-old kids running around the parking lot while I'm trying to park (without running them over). No adults anywhere to be seen. We get in the hotel and its bedlam in the lobby. Kids running around the hotel with adults standing around, generally not giving a fuck that other people may be utilizing the hotel, too. 
 
So we get to our event's room and some kids from the other event open the door and come in to ours. They see our kids playing with a bunch of toys and hoola hoops my in-laws brought and want to join in. The hotel staff quickly remove them and tried to lock the doors. But these kids - about 6-8 different ones - keep coming in. I go back into the lobby to try to find the parents. Nothing but bedlam in stark contrast to the control we had over our kids (and my own 4- and 5-year olds). 
 
So, as a parent, and a Jewish person myself, I felt it was time to teach the parents of the Orthodox Jewish kids the dangers of leaving their kids unsupervised. 
 
The next time their kids came in to our party, I handed each one of them a strip of bacon and told them to bring it to their mom. They never came back.

2015-04-07 02:36:19+00:00,2662,School bus loading zones are for school buses.,psyfive,"Years ago I drove a school bus. In my old district when we parked at a school it was policy to park with our front bumper only a couple of inches from the bus in front of us to keep kids from blindly darting between the buses into traffic. The bus zones were granted enough space to get the required number of buses that serviced the school and if a bus didn't fit in the zone policy stated that the driver had to find a spot, usually a block or two from the school, and wait until enough room has cleared up in the loading zone. 

Occasionally we would get parents parking in our zone but most times a quick chat with the parent or an address over the school PA system would get the car moved and all of our buses into their spots. Except for this one parent, every day she would show up and park underneath the school bus loading only sign and disappear into the school. The one time I tried to talk to her she called my supervisor with claims that I verbally harassed her. I don't know about modern school bus recording equipment but the system our district had at the time recorded any audio in range of about 15 feet of the open door. I was told that if she parks in the loading zone again I was to call our radio dispatcher who would send out a roving campus security guard who would ticket the driver for parking in a no parking zone. The one time that the security guard made it with enough time to catch her in our zone he let her go with a warning.  

A week had passed since the guard incident and as I approached the school I saw the first four buses lined up bumper to bumper and directly behind them was the parent. I was bus number five of nine that serviced the school, the last bus was going to run late because he wouldn't be able to fit into the loading zone, but this time the parent had made a mistake, she hadn't left enough room to pull her car out from between the buses. So I did was I was supposed to do, pull up as close as possible to the bumper of the vehicle in front of me. She loaded her kid into the car and realized that she wasn't able to get out from between the buses without one of us moving. She went to the bus in front of her and he pointed out that he was just as stuck and couldn't move the bus until departure time, she then tried to get me to back up to let her out because I didn't need to park so close to her. I told her that she didn't NEED to park in a bus loading zone. After a few hollow law suit threats she finally retreated to her car and had to wait an extra twenty or so minutes until we all departed.

I didn't see her in the loading zone again for the rest of the school year.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/31pc5d/school_bus_loading_zones_are_for_school_buses/,pettyrevenge,114,

I had no idea where they came from, the coworkers who usually use my mini-fridge told me the salads weren't theirs.     
Turns out one of the temps got the idea to start putting her food in my mini-fridge without my permission.      
If she would've asked me, I probably would've said yes and I wouldn't be sitting here on my break typing this out, but it's too late for that now.    
So without even telling her anything, I turned the temperature of my mini-fridge as low as it'll go.     
By the time lunch time rolled around, her salads were practically frozen.

A dozen or so bright-eyed junior high students eagerly listened as our social studies teacher gave us an important assignment: each of us had to write a letter to a government official on a subject of our choice. Some students wrote to Representative Lois Capps. Others wrote to Senator Barbara Boxer. I decided to write to the big man himself: President George W. Bush.

This was pre-9/11; Bush was just beginning his first term. I wrote him a letter with my ideas on how to improve the public school system. I was courteous and respectful throughout the letter; this was the president I was writing to, after all!

Another student also wrote to Bush. She (her parents) supported Al Gore, and she made sure that Bush knew it. She started her letter by letting him know that her family did not vote for him, nor do they support him. The rest of the letter was filled with similar statements, along with HER OWN PLANS to fix the public school system.

A month passed. Thank-you letters from senators and representatives trickled in to the junior high. Then, a plain white envelope from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue arrived for the girl that wrote President Bush. With a smug look on her face, she opened up a thank-you letter from the president that started with:

&gt;Dear student, thank you for writing.

Also enclosed was a wallet-sized picture of the president.

My letter from the White House came the same day. Instead of a plain envelope, I received a large manila envelope. Enclosed was a letter that started with:

&gt;Dear *Friend*, thank you for writing.

Included was an enormous, 8"" x 11"" portrait of the president.

This was too much for the girl to handle. It was bad enough for her to receive a smaller portrait than I did, but the fact that Bush addressed me as a friend and her as a mere student made her absolutely furious. I haven't kept in touch with her since then, but I doubt she ever voted Republican since that incident.

2015-03-08 23:29:02+00:00,2993,I really hoped you'd steal this one. And I got my wish,100jumpingbeans,"My girlfriend's parents own a large parcel of land in a very rural area and behind it they have another larger parcel of land leased to hunt on. Last summer me and her father built a deer stand for me to hunt out and we put it on the hill between his brothers stand and his (unfinished) stand.

Well it's not uncommon at all for people to leave equipment in frequently used deer stands. Equipment such as space heaters, binoculars, etc.

Anyway, about two weeks after hunting season was over and me and my girlfriend came back home her mother called and told us that someone had stolen her uncle's binoculars, rangefinder, and even his spaceheater and had stolen the bottles of water I'd left in mine (yea really, water bottles) and left my door open to the elements. This pissed everyone off. Not least because their hunting lease is essentially their backyard. We were told they think he keeps coming back because a game camera went missing a week before and a couple days after the initial heist my door was swinging open again. So I began to plan.

GF's parents raise goats. In their pasture they have an old rotting shed that's not used anymore but the goats occasionally sleep in. I went out there once to help clean up a mess left by a coyote killing a baby goat and noticed the biggest wasp nest I'd ever seen. After having our stands broken into I got an idea.

I put on a slicker suit and pvc gloves along with one of my old SCBA masks from work and duct taped every possible seam. I got a wooden box and a garden sprayer full of water and carried it out to the next. I sprayed all the wasps I could with water (they can't fly if their wings are wet) and dislodged the nest and all the wasps I could find into the box. I then put the box into a cardboard box for a space heater I previously reinforced with duct tape and threw in some scrap metal to give it more weight. I then used scotch tape to seal all the corners and cracks except for some tiny air holes. So now I have a Big Box O' Wasps ™.

I put the box in the corner of my stand and sure enough, a week or so later, my gf's parents called me and said my stand was open again and the box was gone.  I hope you open it inside your house, asshole.

So as always I went to sleep at 6pm and woke up at 9pm, took a shower and went to work.  My gf knew all along,  she even made me coffee to go.  So I arrive at work and my coworker is already there. This is when I remembered I had the day off. 

So anyway,  I come home and my gf is laughing her ass off at how she is the best and she tricked me ecc. I admit,  it was a good one. 

Later,  she goes to bed because she is working early in the morning,  and I, fuelled with caffeine,  play some games and plot my revenge. 

You must know,  that she sleeps like a bear,  so my plan was simple: move all the clocks 2 hours forward,  so she would wake up at 3am instead of 5am and go to work 2 hours earlier,  just to find there on her computer that it is not time to work yet. 

First I set her iphone and then all the clocks in the house,  and also in the car.  Altogether 10min of work.
 
I then went to sleep and woke up to 20 phone calls and a lot of messages from her. 
I didn't call her yet,  I want her to suffer a bit more.

I'm enjoying my coffee now.

Update: I got pizza for lunch. 

Oh and also,  my gf was not (that) mad,  and took it well (as she should because she started it...).
I was not mad at all for yesterday ,  because I'm the one who pranks her usually,  and it was a good prank.

2015-03-01 00:20:05+00:00,2182,Fake Id,_he3_,"Many years ago I was about 19 years of age and went into a gas station to buy smokes. The guy behind the counter asked for my ID. This doesn't bother me because 18 is the legal age and I always got carded. But then he says, ""This is a fake ID, I'm not selling you cigarettes"" and I recall the smile on his face that showed he knew he was abusing his power and there is nothing I could do about it. 
After a few days I go back into the convenience store of the gas station and notice he is working the counter. And then the thought hit me. I will buys tons of stuff! As much as my arms can carry and sit there and make him ring it all up! 
I grab lots of small items just to make the process longer. Then I make sure to queue up to be at his counter. It took forever to ring up! 
Then when he told me the total price I look him right in the eye and flatly say, ""Oops forgot my wallet in the car."" I then go to my car and drive away knowing he will probably have to scan each item again to cancel the sale.

That's fine, I'll just use your loaner car to drive over there myself.",chbailey442013,"A couple of months ago my truck engine blew and I had to find a new car in a hurry.  There is a dealership within a mile of me so I had someone take me to it.  The salesman was really nice and friendly and before long he had me convinced to actually get a more expensive car than I had originally planned and he let me drive it as a loaner while he contacted the financing companies  (I had originally planned on spending 7-8k, the car he was trying to get me in was 12K).  Lo and behold, he couldn't get me financed for the more expensive car, but there were 2 pieces of shit that he could get me in for my original 8k.   Now this was a dealership that had five more stores in the city so I looked online and saw an awesome Nissan Murano in great condition with low miles for that same 8K.  I asked him if they could get it from the other store from me and he goes ""Welllllllllllllll......that would be an additional $400 for us to transfer it from their inventory to ours, and these two cars are very similar (they weren't), and blah, blah, blah, bullshit, bullshit bullshit""  

So I hatched my plan, I told him to give me an hour to think it over and I would be back. If I decided to buy one of the cars, then great and if not I would bring back his loaner then.   INSTEAD, I drove the 15 minutes to the other store in his loaner car and made the deal for the Murano myself.  As I was wrapping up the deal, I asked the GM to call the original store and tell them that he was going to send their loaner back to them.  It was so sweet listening as the original salesman got pissed off and threatened to have me arrested. The GM told him (Direct quote), ""Gordon, cut the bullshit, and put your GM on the line.  You didn't want to make the deal and we did.  I have your car on my lot and am getting one of my guys to bring it back tomorrow morning.

So I was at the supermarket today, collected a few things and headed for a till. It was mid-morning, not very busy so as usual I scanned the line of tills and picked an empty one. I put all my things on the belt, wheeled the trolley through the other side and waited.....and waited.....and waited, while the cashier unpacked boxes of plastic bags and hung them on hooks next to her. All in all it must have taken her a couple of minutes to finish hanging those bags before she started to put my shopping through, occassionally glancing up at me as if to say ""go on say something"". Well i can be failrly laid back and a minute or two is no big deal, but that glance ? well.....

So I started packing my things as she rang them through. Cashiers are pretty fast and I normally stop packing to pay so they can finish the transaction while I finish the packing. But today, I slowed down....a lot. After she finished scanning she had to wait for some time as I carried on packing very carefully, intent on finishing it before I made any inclination to pay.

Did she offer to help pack ? No - instead she huffed and puffed at the delay (there was nobody else in the queue!) so I just said ""Sorry - I'm nearly finished. Why don't you hang up a few bags while you're waiting?""

&amp;nbsp;

-Minor assholes: folks that refused to look at my uncle or acknowledge his presence, scoffed at him, things like that.  
Revenge: Readjust their mirrors, replace their favorited radio stations. Put their tapes in the wrong case...  
&amp;nbsp;

-Major assholes: Racist comments directed towards my uncle, threats (guy told my uncle if he found the tiniest scratch on his car, he'd have his bodyguards beat him up, stuff like that).  
Revenge: After driving the car out of sight, uncle would drop his pants and underwear and park the car bare-assed.

One day after I had parked in the student lot and was walking to class, I hear a car honking and a woman yelling ""Hey you!"". Now this sounded like some loud mouth trying to get their friends attention so I ignored it until it happened again much closer to me. I turned and see a woman with her window rolled down looking at me rather annoyed.

""I need directions to College Hall."" She made no attempt being cordial at all. Whatever, I'll help her out anyway. I start thinking about the best way to get her there and raise my right arm to start pointing her in the right direction when she snaps her fingers at me. ""Hurry up! I have an interview to get to and you're making me late."" 

Oh hell no. If you had an interview you should have arrived early. That's standard procedure, or at least in my book it is. I didn't say this of course. Instead I slowly lowered my right arm and raised my left. ""College Hall is right past those dorms, it's a big white building right behind the tree line, you can't miss it."" There's nothing past the tree line except for more trees. As she parked and walked quickly off without a thank you or even a look of gratitude I called out ""Good luck with your interview!"". I chuckled to myself for the rest of day.

2015-02-04 10:44:45+00:00,2074,"Be lazy and rude, and I'll subtly remind you of your fat ass, every single day.",[deleted],"This all started about two years ago, when I started a new job.  I started at the same time as another guy.  The individual tasked with training me was doing a great job at it.  We meshed well, and I was learning very quickly.  The other new guy wasn't so lucky.  His trainer, who we'll call FatAss (FA for short), was a lazy fuck who could barely show up to work on time.  She would hardly pay attention to him throughout the shift; she'd actually sit at another desk and watch YouTube, or fuck around on Pinterest for the majority of the day.  

That sucks for the other new guy, but not me, right?  Wrong.  After about two months, still in training, management started to notice how poorly the other new guy was performing in comparison to myself.  They recognized that FA was doing a poor job of training him, but instead of addressing *the elephant in the room*, they just decide to switch our trainers.  

Having already witnessed how she ""trained,"" I wanted no part of that, and strongly voiced my concerns to management (without flat-out saying that I didn't like FA).  I shouldn't have even tried because FA was at least smart enough to put two and two together.  From that day on, she was short and cold with me.  

Over the last two years, her attitude towards me has not changed at all, despite my being nothing but professional towards her.  In fact, I've been on another shift for the last year and she's still rude during turnover (the fifteen or so minutes of overlay, when I give report to her and others).

About a month ago, I was getting especially irritated with her attitude.  At the same time, our office bought new chairs with adjustable *everything*.  So, I formulated a plan.  Every single day for the last month, before she arrives, I go to her desk and adjust the arms on her chair.  I bring them all the way inside, to their most-narrow point.  After I give my turnover to the relief shift, I stand around and chit-chat with others while I watch FA go to her desk.  Without fail, every single day, she abruptly drops her fat ass down into the chair, jamming its arms up into her fat ass cheeks.  I think about it and smile the entire drive home.

 Years ago I worked with a guy who grew up in chicago during the 50's.  He told the story of one particularly nasty winter when he and his father spent a long time clearing their driveway, only to come home later and find a neighbors car parked in it. 

His father was enraged, but rather than heading off to thrash the owner, he got a water hose and sprinkler out of storage, and hooked them up. 
He set the sprinkler so it would cover the car pretty evenly, turned it on and walked away. 

The car was soon a car shaped iceberg. 


The owner must have taken the hint, because they never caught him trying to get into it, but occasionally ice would be chipped away around the door.  It took multiple attempts before they finally managed it though. Especially since his dad slosh another bucket of water over it now and then.

When I realized I'd already lost, I began asking him questions. Everything I could think of. For 27 minutes, I talked about car insurance and accident forgiveness and right of way. 

Why? The reason he gave me that ticket was because he was upset that I slowed him down. So I slowed him down even more. For 27 minutes, I successfully detained a police officer.

Couple years ago I was at the gym, just finished my workout, about to take a shower. I hear this highschool bully type and his buddy harassing this guy in the changing room for the color of his underwear (baby blue and pink), calling him gay, fag, and whatnot. The guy getting harassed is just trying to change and get the fuck out of there without fueling this idiots rant.

After hearing a : You fucking faggot, why the fuck are you even here? Don't you lift dicks for a living?!?

I just walk over to the guy, and ask him what his problem was? I mean, he was attacking somebody who hasn't said one word to him other than answering: ""so what"" to, what are you gay or something?

He just starts laughing, trying to get me to ""join the fun"". I tell him to fuck off, and go take my shower.

Take my shower, go to grab a towel, and it's gone. Then I hear the guy again. 

- What are you going to do about it fag lover? You going to cry on a dick?

At this point, I was fucking livid. There are rules in gym's, there are social conduct rules, there are so many things he was completely ignoring.

He's still here, laughing with his friend on how much he ""owned"" that little fag.

I storm out of the shower, butt naked, march directly to him, and, me, being 6'4"", 210 pounds and in decent shape, walk up to him, still laughing at his total revenge with my towel. Without losing momentum, I take both hands, and push him just semi low on the chest. He flew the 2 feet, hit the locker and fell.

His reaction: WHAT THE FUCK MAN?! Can't you take a joke?

Trying to get up, I push him down again, and again, until I have my foot on his chest and say.

What, you don't lift dick for a living?!?

He was never seen again.

2015-01-13 13:51:06+00:00,3001,Point out that I'm not working will you...,ThrowAway54126984,"I work in an office with a pretty cool boss.  If we have nothing to do he is perfectly fine with us browsing the internet so long as emails are answered when they come in &amp; the phones are not left to ring.  There are only 6 of us in the office, less before Christmas, when this story takes place, due to people using the last of their leave.

Anyways, I have to be a couple of hours earlier than my workmates on certain days which means that when we are quiet, like before Christmas, I have normally completed all my work before they arrive.  

So there I am, minding my own business, browsing the internet at about 09:30 when Mrs StickMyNoseIntoEveryonesBusiness aka Mrs S. shouts 'Oh, must be lovely doing some online Christmas shopping this early in the day ThrowAway' at me.  I just turn around &amp; tell her that I have done everything I can do.  She smirks and gets back to her work.  Bitch! 

I sit there for the next hour or so not a very happy bunny.  It's not that she would have got me into trouble with the boss (he knows I work hard as my Christmas bonus proved), it was just the fact that she thought she might get me into trouble.

So I plotted.  My boss may be a cool guy about going on the internet, one thing he is not so cool about is people using the printer for personal reasons.  I happen to know Mrs S. likes to spend most of her afternoons browsing recipe websites, saving them onto Word &amp; then printing page after page off.  She of course stands by the printer as she is doing this so she can grab the small novel quickly before anyone else can.  She has only slipped up once when she must have pressed print the same time her phone rang, I was passing the printer, noticed the reams printing off &amp; had a look at what they were.

So, I decide that I will screw her over royally by diverting her prints to the printer in my boss' office.  I waited for 3 days before I was in the office by myself at lunch time so I could divert all her prints there. It was worth it.  She must not have printed any recipes off for a while so had a good few pages worth ready to go.  She pressed print &amp; practically ran to the printer as is her way.   Nothing.  Checks the paper, yeah, no problem there.  All the while I am watching trying to supress a giggle.  As she is about to turn back to her desk, I imagine to double check she did press print, my boss walks out of his office.  I would guesstimate about 15-20 pages of recipes in glorious colour in his hand.  He looks at Mrs S. 'these are yours assume'.  She goes bright pink &amp; he asks her into his office.  I don't know what was said but she didn't look happy when she went back to her desk.

As we drive into the parking lot, I can already tell it's going to be a good day. The coveted front row spot was waiting for us. My daughter is in a great mood. I'm in a great mood. Life is awesome. We bought stuff, rode the carousel, rode 50 cent rides, Disney store, Build a Bear, we had a near perfect day... until we left.

Walked out of the mall and got to the minivan. I put my daughter in her carseat and proceeded to unload our loot into the back of the van. During this time, a car with a 45+ lady is waiting for my front row spot. I can feel her tapping her foot in her car. I start to fold up the stroller and forgot to unpack the little things (hairbow, snacks, random things) from the holder on the stroller handle. I stop to take out that stuff and put it in the van when I hear the lady say from her car to me, ""Looks like we need mom here to show daddy how it's done!"" I can tell she's trying to be funny, but this pissed me off. I give her a fake smile and go about my business.

This lady doesn't know me. She doesn't know if I'm divorced or a widower or anything. People make comments like this all the time to dads out spending time with their kids and it gets under my skin.

So, I slowly pack the rest of the stuff, go around to the side door and get my daughter out of her seat. I start to walk back to the mall right beside this lady's car. I look at her like I'm surprised and say, ""Oh I'm sorry! Were you waiting on MY spot? We're just dropping off some stuff in the van."" I can see that she's perturbed. I finish it with a ""Happy New Year!"" She speeds off and I watch her from the front door of the mall. She has to park towards the back of the parking lot. I walk right back to the van, pack the kid, and drive away. I guess daddy showed her how it's done.

She's crossed the line in her attempts at reconciliation with him many many times in the entire duration of our relationship, but I'm so secure with my relationship that I actually just found it more humorous than anything else. So last week, she came into the restaurant I work at and harassed me with two of her friends for nearly their entire visit.
 
As I'd run food to customer's tables and happened to walk by hers, they'd ""cough"" inappropriate names at me, shoot me nasty looks from across the restaurant, and then texted a mutual friend saying more horrible things about me. (The friend in question sent me a screenshot of their text conversation). Okay, whatever, I can deal with that. But *then* after they leave, they proceed to go through the drive-thru and say into the speaker, ""Hi, I'm here to pick up -insert my boyfriend's name-"". I believe my coworker who was operating drive-thru at the time (and knew about the entire situation) replied with ""*Excuse* me?"" and they just drove through, flipping all of us off into the window as they passed. Psycho bitch, right?


So anyways, fast forward to Tuesday night. My mom decides she wants to order a pizza from a local chain that her best friend owns, and it just so happens that crazy ex-girlfriend works there as well. Mom calls in the order, but I offer to go and pick it up for her. I figured if crazy ex-girlfriend was working at the time and saw me, it would make her night a little bit more shitty, which is totally rad, but I never knew what was yet to come.

I walk into the pizza joint, and there are 3 people up front. Crazy ex-girlfriend, mom's best friend/the owner, and my mom's other friend who used to babysit me back in the day. The former babysitter hasn't seen me in quite a while - 6 or 7 years at least - so when I gave her my (mom's) name for the pizza, she was *enthusiastic*. ""marryacomputer?! Oh my god! You've grown up so much, you're so gorgeous!!!"". Then, the owner proceeds to chime in, ""Isn't she?

2014-12-10 21:52:30+00:00,2589,Petty revenge 40 years in the making.,BlueMacaw,"Back in grade school, I popped the lock on the bathroom door and took about 5 seconds of Super8 film of my little sister sitting on the toilet.  I thought it was hilariously funny and it was to teach her a lesson about invasion of privacy (she'd embarrassed me by snooping through my drawers and sharing personal letters).  

My parents, of course, weren't amused.  I was grounded and, even worse, never allowed to use the video camera again.  My sister, out of earshot of our parents, gloated over me being the only one to get into trouble.  And the punishment seem horribly unfair at the time because no one ever saw the footage.  Keep in mind this was back in the mid-70s when there was no instant playback; you had to mail the film off and wait a few weeks for it to return.  My parents asked the film developers to remove the last 5 seconds of the film when it was processed.

Or so they said...  

Fast forward 40 years.  My parents recently gave me all the old 8mm family films, so I thought I'd surprise them by having all the reels converted to DVD for Christmas.  And guess what I found at the tail end of one of those reels?  Yep.  The infamous deleted toilet scene.

Here's my petty revenge:  I got in trouble for something no one ever saw before so now, decades later, [here's a tastefully edited screen shot](http://imgur.com/28yYRU3) that literally DOZENS of people might see.  

**TL;DR:  The only thing worse than a nosy little sister is petty older sister with a grudge.**

**EDIT WITH UPDATE, 01JAN15:** I showed this to my sister (keep in mind we’re both in our 40s now) right before Christmas, not having any idea how she'd react to it.  I honestly thought only a handful of people might see it, maybe a few hundred if I was *really* lucky, but as of today it's had 33,098 views.  

She absolutely loved it; read every single comment and laughed her ass off.  But I know her 7-yr old self would have cried in abject humiliation and 9-yr old me would have been overjoyed at the epic revenge of having tens of thousands of strangers around the world see her on the toilet.

Showing this to her before Christmas was a mistake, though, especially with our parents in the room.  She blurted out, ""Oh my God!  You converted all those tapes for us for Christmas?""  Completely ruined the surprise.

The divorce came about because she cheated on my brother with a guy half her age (she is 40) who is a convicted felon. Her boyfriend violated his parole and is now sitting in jail awaiting a hearing to see if he is going back to jail. She actually had the balls to ask my brother to pay for his bail so he could get out. When my brother declined she  went into a rage and demanded access to her stuff (she has about 30 boxes and a bunch of furniture in storage in his garage. He was fine with letting her keep it there until she got a place she could put it). He told her he would take care of that.

The next day he loaded it all up and delivered it to her friend's house (where she is staying) while she was at work. At first the friend was cool with him bringing her stuff over, until she realized how much stuff it was. Now her entire apartment is packed with boxes and furniture and it looks like a storage unit.

When his ex got home from work she called my brother and screamed at him that she wanted a key to his place so she could come get what she needed whenever she wanted, not this. He told her that she didn't specify that and that he wouldn't ever give her a key to the place, but she didn't need to worry.

Back in my sophomore year of college my parents were having a small family reunion with my aunt, uncle and cousins. My sister was excited to attend a concert that night (which I would be driving her to), and my parents were getting a little drunk outside having an absolute blast.


My sister decided we needed to get some more snacks so she roped me in to driving her and my cousins down to the corner market to buy some more snacks. On the way down we had this exchange:

&gt; Sister: Ugh that kid on the bike there goes to school with me he's such a faggot.

&gt; Me: Seriously princeofsnark's sister? Ive been gay for 4 years, why the fuck would you use that word? You know I hate that.

&gt; Sister: Oh shut up princeofsnark you're so fucking sensitive. Faggot doesn't even mean that anymore. I'll call you a faggot all I want. Faggot faggot faggot.

&gt; Me: Well fuck you! Drive your own ass to the concert!

&gt; Sister: Good luck with that faggot, you know mom will just make you do it.


Obviously I'm a little touchy about that word, but as a guy who was bullied and called that word every day it stings now to hear it thrown around. And coming from someone who is supposed to be in my court, well that just frankly hurts.


But what really got me was what she said about the concert. I felt like such a little bitch and I was tired of being stepped on by her. I was not going to take this sitting down.


So you know what i did Reddit? 


I did NOTHING. I didn't yell. I didn't complain. I didn't drive her ass to the concert. The one she was so excited for. My sister yelled. She screamed. She raged and embarrassed herself in front of my aunt and uncle and cousins.


Even after i told my parents what she said their response was golden:

&gt;""Princeofsnark, she's your sister! Besides you have to drive her, we've been drinking.""


AND YOU KNOW WHAT?! I still said no.

I didn't yell. I didn't get dramatic. I just said no, walked in to the house and turned on the TV. 


My parents were stunned. My sister was practically catatonic. Despite threats of being grounded and screamed at. I still. Said. NO.


My sister was late to the concert and was forced to find a friend to drive her there. My parents were furious with me, but in the end I wasn't punished. I mean, how could they? I made it very clear that they were basically telling my sister she could call me that and it wouldn't matter. If they didn't want to deal with her shit, well then I WOULD.


I still feel good about that day, and you know what Reddit? My sister never called me a faggot ever again. 

Don't take advantage of me being nice. I was fully prepared to go down in a blaze of parental anger to make my point and I did.


Hope the opening act was great bitch! So glad you missed it.


This faggot is done with your shit.


**Holy shit I've been gilded! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.**

In the lot right next to the building my class was in, there was one spot left, but an SUV with a ton of bumper stickers had parked badly and was taking up about a third of that last spot.  

My only other option was to go park in a different parking lot that was about a fifteen minute walk away from my class.  I had less than five minutes before class started.  My car was small enough to fit in the remaining spot with about an inch of clearance between my car and Mr. SUV's driver-side door. Oh well.  I wasn't late to class.  

After class, the SUV was gone and there was a note on my windshield that said ""Nice parking job, asshole.""  I was pretty annoyed because I wasn't the one who parked shittily in the first place, but I stuck the note in my purse, forgot about it, and went on with my day.  

A couple weeks later, I saw the same SUV with all the bumper stickers in the same parking lot, parked terribly.  I remembered I still had his note in my purse.  I left it on his windshield and went on with my day merrily.

Dear Jerk-hole Regular Customer at my minimum wage fast food restaurant,
You became our mayor in the last election. Not like it's a crazy important position in a town with 3,000 people, but still, it's obvious that you were very very proud of it. You acted like it was such a privilege for me and my co-workers to give you your 90¢ coffee every morning, and then of course you had to have your exact number of 4 equal packets and 4 cream cups, but you had to put them in yourself (because those making minimum wage aren't capable of that). On top of the fact that you look down on us (honestly, it's whatever, I'm used to it) YOU LEAVE YOUR CONDIMENT GARBAGE RIGHT THERE ON THE FRONT COUNTER WHERE WE SERVE THE OTHER CUSTOMERS. Or, like that one time when our computers were down so we couldn't take anybody's order, you demanded that we ring you up 'the old fashioned way' with paper and pencil, because you had to get your fill of mcbeetus steak bagel (well done, no sauce) ... 

You sir, are a jerk. But. I'm happy now. Wanna know why? Our town just had the mayor elections. And you lost. By 7 votes. Do you know how many votes that is? That's 4 stepped on minimum wage workers and 3 of my friends/classmates that I had told how much of a jerk you are. I haven't seen you since before the election, but I'm willing to bet your step has lost some of its pep. Enjoy your nasty cheap coffee, Mr. Ex-Mayor Jerk

The reason is because the trash puck up guys can't empty it if there's a vehicle blocking it. Well, a few days ago I saw a lady pull in *and block it in*. I let her know she'd be in the way of the trash fella and she told me (rather snottily) ""I have been parking here **for years** and no one has ever told me to move!""

Well, whatever Snoot. I watched her lock up her bmw something or other and walk in te front doors. Not 2 minutes later, garbage truck pulls in. He gets out and we talk a bit, turns out this particular car has been in his way in the past. I tell him what Ms. snoot said and he grinned and told me to watch. He then gracefully maneuvered his moster truck around her car and got the dumpster hooked, then dumped it in his truck... but when he swung it back, he gave it the scenic route over her bmw. Dumpster juice dribbled steadily across her car, from the rear passenger side to the driver's side. It. Was. Disgusting. And beautiful all in one. He shot me a thumbs up and drove off. Snoot came in later, accusing me of ""vandalizing"" her baby, and I just told her the garbage man did the best he could with a car blocking the dumpster.

I'd just bought a new loaf with plans of making some PB&amp;J and, more specifically, a grilled cheese to go with the tomato soup I'd bought.  I'm a college student and my food budget is a little limited so, sadly, a good loaf of bread with the means to make some sandwiches is a treat.  

I went to sleep before work while images of tasty sandwiches danced in my head.  I woke up and went into the kitchen to make my sandwiches only to find that my entire loaf of bread was gone!  I already knew what had happened.  I went to my roommate and asked him where my bread went.  He told me ""Oh, I ate it while you were sleeping."" like he didn't just ruin my meal plans for the day.  I asked ""So what the hell am I supposed to eat before work!?""  He said ""I didn't really think about that.  Relax, I'll buy you a new loaf.""

I scrape together something to eat and head off to work, eased a little by the knowledge that my bread will be replaced and I can have a sandwich when I get home.

Fast forward 8.5 hours

I get home, put my things away, wash up, and head to the kitchen to make my sandwich.  I see sitting on the counter a loaf of the cheapest generic brand crap he could find.  I kid you not this stuff is hard and tastes like cardboard WHEN IT'S FRESH!!  I proceed to flip my shit, he knows what kind of bread I eat and it's right next to the shit he bought.  His response was ""Chill man, it's only bread ...""

I know that he is extremely picky about the beer he drinks and always keeps a 6 pack of his favorite in the fridge.  To get my revenge I wait until he goes to work and I drink his entire 6 pack and replace it with a 6 pack of Natural Light.  I lined the bottles up on the counter so he'd be sure to see them and waited.  

He gets home a few hours later, puts his shit away, washes up, and walks to the fridge to get a beer.  He see's the bottles and yells ""Dude! You drank all my beer!""  I yell back ""Relax, I got you some more.""  He opens the fridge, see's the 6 pack of inferior beer, and storms into my room beer in hand.

""What the fuck is this shit!?  This isn't what I drink!"" to which I reply ""Chill man, it's just beer ...""

**TL;DR** - Roommate ate my good bread and replaced it with crap so I drank all his good beer and replaced it with Natural Light.

2014-09-30 16:21:27+00:00,2434,Just the sour cream.,cosalich,"Our story takes place yesterday, and while I was neither the recipient nor the perpetrator of the petty revenge in question, I was both willing participant and benefactor.

I was headed home after a long day of pretending to work hard when my wife called; she had forgotten to pick up sour cream in her earlier trip to the grocery store which was about to lead to a very disappointing burrito night. Being that I take burrito night an order of magnitude more seriously than any other night, I resolved to rectify the situation by swinging by the local grocer and picking some up myself.

A quick stroll past all of the temptations of the snack aisle later I had obtained my prize and was on my way to the the registers at the front. I chose the shortest line with the fewest items on the conveyor belt, set my sour cream down between two rubber dividers and patiently waited for the nice folks in front of me to finish paying.

The trouble is, you see, these people weren't terribly nice folks.

The cashier totaled their order of assorted cheetos and lard-bricks and what have you, then informed them cautiously that the register had crashed; she was unable to complete the transaction and would have to try scanning all of their items again.

This was apparently dissatisfactory to our snack food aficionados, and they expressed their annoyance:

&gt;What the fuck? I've been waiting in line *forever!*

Now having arrived in line shortly after them, and witnessing the fact that they very clearly had been waiting no longer than three minutes, I was inclined to disagree with them. That said, it's understandable that they would be agitated at a minor setback, as they were the type of people that may need three entire minutes to lumber their massive physiques through the parking lot. The cashier apologized sincerely and began to unpack their bags to scan their merchandise again, having reset the register.

This, of course, was when disaster struck. These poor people, in dire need of their simulated cheese snacks, might as well have been at the center of an asteroid collision. When our valiant cashier had unbagged, re-scanned and re-bagged all of their various poor life decisions, the register crashed again. This was met with another chorus of well-meaning constructive criticism:

&gt;How do you keep *doing* that? I'm in a *hurry* god damn it. Where's the manager? I want a discount! I'm a customer!

Now keep in mind that at this point, I have been waiting roughly five to six minutes for my two-dollar tub of sour cream. Naturally, the only thing keeping me sane at this point was the thought of delicious savory burritos. Well, either that or the fact that I'm an adult that is able to act maturely when out in public with intent to conduct a transaction that will satisfy my need for a dollop of sour cream.

Luckily, with my being slightly inconvenienced and our heroes on the throes of destruction, the manager arrived to address their complaints. The conversation went somewhat like this:

&gt;We want a discount!

To which the manager replied:

&gt;I'm sorry, that's not something we can do, however we will move the purchase to a new register and ring you through right away.

The manager then apologized profusely to everyone in the lineup; a grand total of the fine specimens in front of me, myself, and a little old lady behind me. Naturally, I proposed the idea that the wait was not of dire consequence, and that I was indeed unaffected.

As the manager set to restoring the register to working form, the shining examples of humanity were continuing to gripe about free goods for their trouble, the manager refused to acknowledge them, instead turning to me and asked quite bluntly:

&gt;Just the sour cream for you today sir?

I smiled, little did he know how important that sour cream was. Not *just* sour cream, but yes, my only purchase. I looked on quizzically as I saw the manager's face twist up in the smirk of a recently-hatched scheme. He returned my look with a smile bordering on maniacal, and delivered his dose of petty revenge.

&gt;That's on the house today sir.

He let his gaze fall on the now-silent complainers, while still facing me.

2014-09-24 15:29:36+00:00,2461,Mother-in-law shared her honest opinion of me. I hope she enjoys her relationship with her son and grandchildren.,literate_frog,"I met my husband when we were 17. We got married several years later and just celebrated our 20th anniversary.  I know this man, I have seen how much he remembers things. 

My relationship with his father was always tense. With his mother, it seemed we were close but about 7 years ago I realized she had never and would never consider me part of the family (this was at the point my husband and I had spent half our lives together, with a great future foreseen). I acknowledged the issue and tried to move ahead in a positive way to support my husband and allow my children to have access to their grandparents.  

Last Christmas there was a HUGE blow-up at the in-laws' house. His father started in on me, then his sister and finally his mom. When my hubby walked out of the room to pack our things and go home early (a 2 hour drive), his mother took a moment to say some of the most horrible things about me I have ever heard. Things about my personality, my parenting skills, my friendships, even my mother and sisters. 

I admit, I responded with one very unladylike sentence. 

Since that day, I have not contacted her nor communicated with her. The revenge though has been sweet: the boy she raised, who married me and has become an amazing man, is now in charge of the relationship with his parents. This means he (not I) sets up visits, buys and sends birthday cards, calls them every week or two. 

Or not. 

Because you see, this wonderful man is extremely forgetful and doesn't plan ahead well. ADHD can be difficult that way. Every few weeks for 9 months I have heard him say things like, ""Oh shoot, last week was their anniversary,  wasn't it? I forgot to send them a card."" Or, ""Man, I haven't called my mom in a couple of months. Oh well, maybe tomorrow. ""

I am not keeping him from anything. I would not have a problem with him taking our children for a visit - they have seen their paternal grandparents twice in 9 months (my parents live in the same town we do, so my kids have a good, strong relationship with their maternal grandparents). But I know him, I know me, and I know how our relationship has worked since we were 17. 

I have received a few emails asking if we are coming for a visit. This week we again received a card in the mail ""reaching out. "" They have called him a few times to try to set something up, but (as I could have told them) in our relationship, I am the one who finalizes most plans and whoops! Hands off for me! 

TL;DR Hope my in-laws are enjoying their empty mailbox, unused guest room, and the phone that isn't ringing. Their son is over 40, they need to deal with him directly. Oh, too bad, ADHD.

Here, let me show you something..",projectself,"I am driving to work a few months ago and getting close, I have two turns remaining until I turn into the building.  It is just a few blocks away.  All side streets, no highways involved.  This guy behind me is in a black bmw, and he is on my ass the whole time.   I see him checking his phone, then making angry faces at me and getting closer and closer.  I speed up a bit, thinking it might calm him down.  5 over, nope.  Anyway, I make the first turn, and am now on the street where my building is, maybe 600 yards up ahead.  The asshole is still behind me, driving inches from behind me and obviously pissed that I am still going the speed limit, (maybe 35 on this street).  So I speed up a bit and see he does the same.  

I drive an eight year old Toyota truck, not one of the big huge ones, but not one of the small ones.  I do have all terrain tires, and I have certainly driven through pastures, over rocks, popped a curb or 10 in my time.  My suspension is in good shape and have no problem treating my decade old truck like a truck.  

Well as I get closer to my building there is a large speed bump in the street, effectively to get people to slow down as they approach the parking garage entrances.  I look back and see asshole still riding my bumper.  I remember thinking to myself I need to slow down for this speed bump, and looking back and thinking, if I hit my brakes, this guy is going to hit me..  The plan takes shape in my mind and I speed up.. 

I am doing about 45 when I hit that speed bump, and yeehaw..  I did a bit of a jump and land, never once touching my brakes.  Didn't even tap them.  I gave him zero warning for what was about to happen.  

I am watching my rear-view window intensely during this because I wanted to see his reaction.  He was cradling his cell phone between his ear and shoulder when he hit.  His hood bucked up behind me, then slams to the ground.  I see him go flying out of his seat straight up.  He slams his head on the roof of his bmw and his head rolls sideways from impact.  Then he slams back into his seat violently.  He has a total ""wtf was that"" look on his face as he grabs the wheel with both hands to recover.

... and yes, he slowed right the fuck down after that.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/2g0u5j/i_am_going_10_over_still_tailgating_me_here_let/,pettyrevenge,1118,
2014-09-08 18:49:47+00:00,2461,That was my parking space bitch,sixuldv8,"I took the family out to eat at AppleBees. The lot was full and I saw a customer come out to leave so I waited for him to pull out and take the spot. Guy pulls out and a car full of young girls just pull in to my spot. You know the type. Well I rolled down my window and told them I was waiting for that space and the driver says ""to bad, your name wasn't on it"". I was livid but just waited for another space and went in and ate.

Girls were at the bar doing shots getting wasted. We enjoyed our meal and paid the waiter. I then asked the waiter if he wanted to make $20. I asked him to go up to the girls, 10 min after we left, and tell them they got a call from someone that said that they had keyed their car and that they should have parked somewhere else. I DID NOT KEY THE CAR.

I called him about an hour later to ask how it went. He said they all went nuts, screaming and shit and even called the police.

BONUS: Cops came and found no damage to car but noticed the girls were to damaged to drive. Cops left and circled back and watched the car. Girls come out, get in car, start the car, and the parking lot explodes in blue light. Busted! DUIs and PDs for all.

I did not know about the bonus till a week later when I went back for a few beers. The waiter recognized me and told me the bonus story, laughing the whole time. Another $20 to the waiter. Best $40 I ever spent.

Edit: There is some confusion about ""DUIs and PDs for all."" Where I am from the key just has to be in the ignition for a DUI, the car doesn't even have to be running. PD=Public Drunkenness. Cops here have a lot of leeway and only need to detect alcohol on the breath to arrest you on that charge. I suspect the girls were all ugly to cops so they got PD. Only the driver got a DUI. As for stoping them in the parking lot/private property rather than wait till they were on the road I would think that that would be a public safety and liability issue. Would be interesting to hear from a LEO about this.

2014-09-05 10:01:24+00:00,2878,Don't lie to your father.,DavidTheGSM,"When my son was 15 he was finally about to go to his first big party. I had a sit down with him and had the drug and alcohol talk. I told him I suspect they will drugs and alcohol at the party and he should be very careful of what he does for there are consequences for everything.

Well I had this conversation with him on a Wednesday (party was on a Friday)

That following Thursday I noticed the grass was getting a bit tall, I kept my mouth shut though normally my son and I would cut it together.

Friday night came around, my son was heading to the party and I said ""Son don't drink, and don't come home drunk"" he promised he wouldn't...I knew my son though.

Sure as shit enough come 2 AM he came home drunk as could be. So know what I did?

I prepared him a nice hearty sandwich and a nice cool glass of water. I sat down with him as he ate his sandwich in awe, I was supportive of him. I didn't scold him, I didn't say he was stupid. He apologized for being drunk, I made sure he got to bed safely. 

We all went to bed, next morning at 8:30 AM in the morning I walked into his room with a two pans and made a huge racket, scared the shit out of him, it unsettled his stomach and he threw up on his bed. Dragged him out, he got dressed gave him a glass of water and told him ""Now your going cut that grass""

He looks at me and goes ""now?"" and I go ""yes now"" he goes ""Can I do it tomorrow"" I said ""nope gotta do it now"" he goes ""why now? why not this evening?"" I said ""This is your punishment"" he goes ""but I thought everything was ok?!?"" I responded ""why do you think that?"" he said ""Cause you made me a sandwich and water and didn't seem angry at all"" I responded ""never said you weren't in trouble, but no sense in yelling at a drunk man, now go outside and start cutting the grass. He of course went for the riding lawn mower. 

I said ""Use the push"" he looks at me in disbelief he goes ""but..."" I go ""but nothing your using the push today""

I have 2 acres of land...using a push takes a LONG TIME

He mowed that yard, I sat in the lawn chair with a nice cool glass of tea and supervised. 

My son to this day still doesn't like to drink.

So my boss tells her with a concerned voice that he would be happy to remake them ""properly"" (with a stern look in my direction), and she accepts (also while giving me a dirty look). So my boss throws out the originals and makes 2 cones both 5 oz EXACTLY (about 2/3 the size of the originals). He gives them to her while she stares with disbelief and starts arguing with him.

These aren't bands that either of us were very interested in seeing but they were free tickets and we had no other plans. We headed to the concert did a little tailgating and then grabbed our tickets at will call. These were incredible seats, VIP passes the whole package. We made our way to the seats about halfway into the opening act, we were in the middle of the section so we had to very politely ask a few people to move, all of them were very accommodating until we reached our seats. Next to the only two open seats sat a middle aged blond woman texting away with all her belongings stacked on our seats, she gave me the hold on sign while she finished texting then began moaning and sighing that she had to move her belonging but eventually did. I sat down next to her and as I did got pushed in my side, I looked to see this woman forcibly elbowing me. I asked what was wrong and she said I had sat on her scarf and destroyed it, I politely apologized and stood up so she could retrieve it while she continued shooting me death glares. As I sit back down I again feel a pain in my side, I look down to see her elbow yet again in my side, as I catch her glare she informs me I'm crowding her and this is HER armrest since she was there first! Ok, whatever, I'm here to have fun so I drop it. Since it's loud, my gf has no clue this is occurring but can see on my face I'm annoyed. We finish watching the opener and we head out for a beer. At this time I explained what had happened and we both decide to just hang out on the lawn and in the lounge, no biggie we really didn't care. After a few drinks we head to the lawn and I end up next to a very large and sweaty couple dancing away and having the time of their life! I asked the guy if he's a Chicago fan and he tells me it's his favorite band ever! I asked my girlfriend for her ticket then presented both of them to the morbidly obese and sweaty couple. They were so happy, like kids on Christmas! They tried to pay but I let him know they were free and he could repay me by having the time of his life, I reminded him to keep dancing once he got down to the seats.

I was with my wife and some friends on the North Shore of Sydney Harbour (by the bridge) to have some drinks and watch the fireworks.

My wife needed to go to the toilet, so I walked with her to the porta-loo village and waited with her in line. 

There was a loud, drunken bogan chick in the line behind us, who was angry at the size of the toilet line.  She started yelling and ranting about all the guys in the line and how they should be ""pissin' in the fuckin' bushes."" (Bear in mind, this is a family event, with tens of thousands of people in a pretty small area).

As the closest man, she started in on me, calling me a bitch for using the toilet and saying that she probably ""had a bigger dick than me.""  (I wasn't even using the toilet, I was just keeping my wife company.)

So, she basically kept ranting and swearing as the line gradually got shorter.  Then, it was my wife's turn.  She goes into the porta-loo,  does her business, and then exits.

As she's leaving, the bogan chick pushed past her into the toilet, saying, ""About fuckin' time.""

As Bogan Chick closes the door, my wife said to her, ""By the way, there's no toilet paper left.""

All we heard was ""Aw Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck!"" from inside the porta-loo.

Then, my wife (with an evil grin) took reams of stolen toilet paper from her coat and handed it to the next person in line.  There was a small round of applause from the people around.

2014-08-05 14:06:16+00:00,2880,"Don't pay me for the job, you don't get to play pool.",Koyoteelaughter,"I'm a pool table installer. I get lots of request to install. I run ads on craigslist often and pick up some business from there. A man calls me up wants his table installed the next morning, but he wants me done by 8 a.m. It means I have to get to his house by 6 a.m. I don't normally start work before 8, but okay. It's going to be fairly easy install.

I arrive at his home. He takes me down to his basement. Floor is really uneven. It takes quite a bit of effort to level it. The man rolls balls on the table to test it. He actually takes twice as long to okay the table as most customers do. I don't fault him. You want a pool table installed and you want to make sure its right before paying some stranger. I tell him how to perform the test. He does them. Does them three more times. Nods and writes me a check.

I don't normally accept checks from people off craigslist, but hey, its a real nice home and he has been nothing but courteous. I thank him. Give him my card so that if he has any problems with the table, he can call me.

I didn't have a problem with the man until I got to the bank to cash the check. Now, you might expect that he wrote me a bad check. It's what I was worrying about when I handed the check to the bank to cash it. They hand it back a few moments later and inform me that the man who wrote it just put a STOP CHECK on it. He called the bank after I left and told them to stop payment on the check. I'm flabberghasted.

I get on the phone. Call him. His reason for stopping payment on the check? He didn't feel comfortable paying for the table install until he'd played eight or ten games on it. His words. I tell him that I'll be there in five minutes. 

Five minutes later, I'm in his driveway. He's behind a locked screen door. I'm courteous. Sir, this isn't a good reason to stop payment on my payment. I installed it. You tested it repeatedly. You sighed off on it. There's a warranty on the install. I provided references before taking the job so you know my warranties are good. I did a job for you before my normal operating ours. Do the right thing and pay me.

He replies, ""I don't feel comfortable paying for it until I've gotten to play 8 or 10 games on it and unfortunately, I don't have time to do it today or tomorrow."" I try to argue my case again. ""You can complain all you want. You can sue me. It's pointless though, because this weekend I will have time to play the games and if there's no problem, I reissue a check on Monday. You'll have your payment before the courts can get involved. Just try and suck it up for a little while, okay?""

If you pictured me shoving my hand through the door, grabbing him by the throat and slapping him on the ground like I was the hulk and he was Loki, I pictured that too. But instead, I offered to replace his tensioner on the pool table. His table was used. I told him I had a new tensioner in the truck. If he would reissue the check today, I would replace that at no cost. He wouldn't have to worry about the felt ever wrinkling. I told him that I noticed his was stripped out. The threading on the adjustment screw had been ground away. I tell him to go check.

He comes back saying he can't find it. I tell him the part is  usually thirty five dollars and thirty five to change, but I'll just throw it in if he'll pay me for the work he's already done. 

After some hee-hawing on his part, he says sure. I assume he was planning on just stop payment on my next check as well. I walk down stairs, lift the end of the table in the air and kicked the shims out from under the legs. I go to the other end and do the same. I collect the shims, put them in my drill bag and climb the stairs with him looking at the table in confusion and me walking up the stairs.

""What did you do? The tables unlevel"" He asked. ""What about the tensioner?""

I told him to pay his bills next time, then informed him that I would be contacting every installer within two hundred miles to let them know who he was and that he didn't pay for his installs. We all more or less know each other. That man isn't getting his table installed.

Oh. There's no such thing as a tensioner on a pool table.

Have fun explaining this one...,Pyromonkey83,"I used to work for the largest company in the world (by market cap) and know quite a bit about their electronic gadgets. This has earned me the unfortunate family title as tech support for all things Fruit related.

Last week, I received a call from my brother asking if I could fix his friend's phone as it was acting weirdly. I told him to come by my place and I would get it sorted out. Well, this friend of my brothers is 16, and kind of a little douche (LD). He also smokes far too much weed to ever be healthy (nothing against the stuff, but seriously... Too much is too much). Anyways, they come by stoned out of their mind right as I finish making myself some delicious baked spaghetti for dinner.

I proceed to update his phone to the new OS and fix his issues (which was an app that required an update to the latest OS version to work properly) and all is ready to go. I come back to find my baked spaghetti completely devoured by LD while my brother was playing video games in the living room.

*You motherfucker.*

So I went into the settings and now his phone autocorrects 'tired' to 'high' every time he types it in. That way, every time he types ""I am too tired"" it becomes ""I am too high"" etc. Give him the phone back and say all is fixed.

Two days later I get a text message asking wtf, because his friend is grounded for telling his parents he was too high to go to a family dinner.

Never. Eat. My. Goddamn. Spaghetti.

--------------------------

**EDIT:** Thank you all for making this delicious revenge my top post ever! A few of you have asked me a main question and/or called me out on this being fake. I would like to provide some proof in the form of my 8""x11"" pan being completely devoid of spaghetti found in this picture:

 [here](http://i.imgur.com/BW7RfFH.jpg)

Finally, for the question:

How did he find out, why text brother, what happened after, etc?

After texting his message to his parents (which by the way, he uses the 'tired' excuse on a constant basis to get out of shit he doesn't want to do), he tried to correct himself by typing 'tired*' which kept correcting to 'high*' over and over again (cue my fucking LOLZ). It looked something like this:

&gt;'I'm too high to go to dinner... sorry guys'

&gt;'too high*'

&gt;'too HIGH*'

&gt;'FUCK TOO T I R E D'

At this point his parents had already called him and chewed his ass out, of course. Afterwards he called my brother saying that his phone was super broken now and explained the situation to him. Brother immediately knew what I had done (I've done similar things to him before) and texted me with the wtf. I then sent him the above picture of me having no spaghetti, that I was pissed, and he deserved my sweet tear induced justice.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/2c931w/eat_all_my_food_while_i_fix_your_phone_have_fun/,pettyrevenge,259,
2014-07-22 06:49:06+00:00,3432,Ruined my stepsister's birthday and got her banned from all clubs in town.,bridgeninja,"Sorry for the length! I had a lot to get off my chest.

**BACK STORY**: When I was 12, my mom got married to a halfway decent guy. He's not bad, but he's not great either, but he made my mom happy and that's all that I cared about. In fact, I cared so much about her happiness that I was willing to endure 6 years of living under the same roof as his self-obsessed, obnoxious, spoiled daughter, Amy. The entire time we lived together, she would project all of her insecurities onto me in the form of insults. Being young and wildly insecure about myself, these daily insults well and truly cut me to the core and just continued the cycle of crippling insecurity. 

When I started ""talking to"" a boy for the first time, Kyle, she all of a sudden developed an intense infatuation with him and told me I was forbidden from communicating with him from then on. I was insecure but I was not a pushover. When I didn't listen to her demands, she took it a step further and told Kyle I had ongoing relationships with several other boys (untrue), which he unfortunately believed. I was completely crushed. She then swooped in and took every opportunity to rub it in my face that she ""won"" him (i.e. inviting him to my birthday parties at home, inviting me out with her only to later reveal I would be thirdwheeling on their date, making him compliment me and then gloating about how she had such a nice boyfriend, etc). This sort of thing happened countless times, not with just boys but with friends and even workplaces! They ended up dating for two years and, although they had a nasty breakup, Kyle and I remained on good terms, which drove her up the wall. She would constantly ask me, ""So did you guys hook up behind my back yet?"" while claiming to have moved on already.

When we finally graduated high school (we were in the same year), I could not be happier to move out and go to college. While I was finally living the life I wanted without her toxicity, she went to 2 different unaccredited schools, both of which she dropped out of after 1 semester at each. Eventually, she moved back in with our parents in our hometown and fell into her old ways again (assuming she had ever grown out of them). On the eve of her 19th birthday, she posted to FB about how her friends had gifted her a fake ID and raved about their plans to club hop for her birthday. 

Even though I lived 500mi away, she still had to find some way to rub it in my face that I would be missing out on all the fun. I was invited to her birthday event page on FB, where she detailed all the extravagant and expensive things she planned for her special day. We're talking limo rental, VIP rooms at 2 of the biggest clubs in town, and even some photographer guy who would follow them like paparazzi. She made a public post on the event page where she tagged me and said, ""It's going to be amazing! Too bad you'll miss out! HAHA. You'll have to wait 2 years before you can experience any of this.""

It had been about a year since I had last seen or spoken to her. By this point, I was at a much happier place with myself, emotionally. It took me a while to shake off the effects of her emotional abuse, but by god, I did it and I wasn't going to let her drag me back to those lows again. But this post got me to reminisce about all the things that she had done to me in the past and I couldn't help but feel a boiling rage inside. 

Now, unbeknownst to her, Kyle had recently reconnected with me on FB. It only friendly conversation between us, catching up on each other's lives, until he suggested we meet up and have lunch (he went to another college an hour away). Lunch turned into us having an afternoon-long shit-talking-fest about Amy. He confessed that she was emotionally abusive to him during their relationship and the only time they didn't fight was when I was in their company (which is why he didn't mind me thirdwheeling on all those dates, apparently). During this, he also confessed he had feelings for me but couldn't forgive himself for letting Amy dangle him in front of me, because he knew that I had liked him. This guilt was apparently something he had been carrying for years and finally found the courage to apologize for now. 

**REVENGE**: Here's where we get petty. I convinced Kyle to alert his brother, who happened to be the marketing director for one of the clubs Amy had reserved a VIP room at, of these upcoming birthday plans. After he did that, I went home and called the limousine rental company and pretended to be a concerned parent and insisted no alcohol be available since several of the girls were underage. They let me know that they were very appreciative of the notice. And then, I did a little digging and found out who the ""paparazzi"" guy would be and called him to cancel his services for the event. With her birthday coming up in just a couple of days, I sat back and waited to let the chips fall where they may... and it was better than I could have hoped for. When I asked about it a few days afterwards, she was sure to screech every beautiful detail to me over the phone.

Since the limo did not provide them with alcohol, they stopped by a friend's house to ""pre-game"" and sneak in their own supply. Once the driver noticed the gaggle of very drunk girls in his limo, he stopped and made them throw away all of the liquor they snuck in. When they got to the first club, Kyle's brother, who knew Amy as Kyle's ex, confronted them at the door and told them there was no way in hell they were getting in. This was VERY upsetting to these group of drunk girls and they all proceeded to make a huge drunken scene, going so far as showing him Amy's fake ID to ""prove"" they were allowed in...except the name on the ID wasn't hers. Kyle's brother, or ""Assfucker"" as Amy called him, had security forcibly remove them from the premises. As the cherry on top, he contacted his friends at the other clubs in town and warned them of Amy and her underage entourage, successfully banning her from every single dance club/bar in a 20mi radius. She didn't even get a refund on the deposits for the VIP rooms. She's lucky she wasn't arrested, but she still plays victim to ""horrible bad luck.""

**TL;DR**: Evil stepsister torments me in our teen years so I ruin her last teenage birthday by getting her banned from every club in town and making her waste thousands of dollars. Also, I fucked Kyle.

**EDIT**: Thank you for the gold! Let me address some questions that were brought up in the comments. Firstly, my stepdad didn't pay for a cent of this, so I have absolutely no guilt about wasting any of his money. Amy and her friends funded the night themselves. Secondly, there was no evil revenge fucking between Kyle and me. Just a good ol' no-strings-attached tryst. Lastly, I cancelled the camera man because I didn't want to give her anything to be happy about. Hahaha.

Because he's wanted my office ever since he was hired, and this is his only chance.

Of COURSE he deserves an office, for his part-time job where he does nothing but copy numbers, but offices are only for management.  He thinks he can get an office if he gets someone fired, and so campaigned Miss Boss to fire me, the only female manager - telling her that I'm lazy, that I can't lead a team, etc.  She thinks he's ""sexy"", and so has listened with awe to his ramblings.

Meanwhile whenever she's gone, Mick smirks at me and brags about how he's going to have my office any day now.  I ignored him at first, but then I had a better idea.  ""Why go for my office?  It's one of the smallest.  Doesn't have a window.  I would think you'd need something bigger... if you're going to be the new vice-president.""

Hmm, well he WAS just thinking of being a manager like me, but yeah why not be a vice-president?  The current vice-president is another sexist asshole, who hired Mick and who sheltered him whenever I would complain about his bullshit and backstabbing behavior.  And while Mick is just making up shit about me, he actually knows some real dirt on the Veep.  Hell, why not?

Vice-President gets the word that Mick is gunning for his job.  Mick has been blabbing about all the ""conferences"" that Veep takes which are really just vacations on the company dime.  The look on Veep's face... I tried to warn you, dumbass.  

I also helpfully remind Mick of my faults, like that I never leave the office on time and I'm always interrupting people at meetings and I sleep at my desk, which is covered in papers.  He agrees those are all terrible things and so he dutifully reports them all to Miss Boss.

Yesterday Miss Boss made the announcement that Veep has been asked to retire.  Word around the watercooler is, that Mick is in deep shit too because he not only blabbed to Miss Boss about Veep, but to our competitors, which made the company look bad.  She is PISSED.  Plus... Mick didn't just ask for Veep's office.  Bigger is better, right?  He asked for *the entire conference room* to be made his office.  He even drew a blueprint of how it could be redesigned, with its own bathroom and sitting area - even bigger than Miss Boss's office.  Rumor has it Miss Boss laughed at him and then said, ""Are you fucking serious?  You're fucking having delusions of grandeur, kid"".  He's lost all credibility and is back typing numbers at his cubicle.

And of course now Miss Boss needs a new Vice-President.  She told me she's heard that I work long hours (I never leave the office on time) and that I constantly have new ideas (I'm always interrupting people at meetings) and that I don't quit until a project is done (I sleep at my desk) and that I needed a bigger office - she pointed to my desk, which is again covered in paperwork.  She asked me if I'd take Veep's old office... and job.  Hell, why not?

**tl;dr Asshole protected by Asswipe.  Asshole wants my job, I convince him to try for Asswipe's job instead.  Both go down, I am the last man standing.**

EDIT:  Well holy shit, this blew up, didn't it?  Lemme answer some questions:

- No, I've never seen House of Cards.  I am, however, a Game of Thrones fan.

- Miss Boss's father recently passed away.  That family comes from ""old money"", they're so rich they don't know what to do with themselves.  Buying this (small-to-medium) sized business wasn't that big a deal to them, it's only a big deal to the ants below.  She just got her degree, after several years of flunking classes - in a major that doesn't have anything to do with the company - and took a year-long vacation to ""find herself"", and giving her this tiny company was Daddy's way of trying to make her grow up.  She really doesn't want to disappoint his memory and is stepping up her game a bit, which is good news for everyone.

- Yes, she fired a lot of people in her first few weeks here.  This state has an ""at will"" employment policy.  She didn't tell them why they were being fired, but she would usually make an offhand comment like ""Ugh, why can't people dress professionally"" while staring at someone and then that same person would coincidentally be called into her office at the end of the day.  Didn't take long to catch on.  She has since stopped doing that, and I've convinced her to hire some people with pretty impressive resumes.

- I'm going to stay and see where this thing goes.  Might as well save up this new paycheck while I can.  And it's possible she could learn good management, and it's an interesting challenge working for a Millenium Age woman.  She does have some decent ideas.  I am updating my resume, however.

- ""Sleeping at my desk"" is what I do instead of going home.  I live alone.  Sorry if I made it sound like I conk out in the middle of the workday.  I have a couch in my office.  Haven't moved into the new one yet because M.B. insisted on redecorating it first.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/29tk91/oh_let_me_help_you_spread_those_nasty_rumors_so/,pettyrevenge,223,

I had a kid (about 14) come in with his mom a little while ago to put some money into his account. He is supposedly supposed to be ""saving"" this money that his mom is giving him, and while I was filling out the paperwork I heard the mom guessing how much money she thought would be in there once the balance was printed.

So I do the deposit, and automatically I know the balance is way off. I double checked the account number, it was correct, so I completed the deposit and pushed the receipt through the window. The kid snatches it with his grubby hands before his mom can, and automatically starts telling me I've made a mistake because he should have more than this. He starts raising his voice repeatedly telling me I'm wrong and I need to put the balance back to what it was.
The mom takes a look at the balance and sort of shrugs it off, gets a few more bills from her purse and asks me to put some more into this kids account. Sure. I do the transaction and print out another receipt with a much healthier balance, much to the kids delight.

Little did this shit know that while I was doing the transaction, I was printing out his transaction history to give to them when they leave. I passed it through the window right after I gave the kid his receipt, saying, ""I thought I would print out the recent transactions on the account so you'll be able to see in detail what processed through, and be able to see if there's any discrepancies."" The kids face dropped as he realized the $300 he spent in the PlayStation marketplace was now visible to his mom, who gave him an earful as they exited the bank. I win, you snot.

TL;DR: Kid complains his balance is wrong on his account, says I made a mistake, so his mother deposits more money. I give the transaction history to mom before they leave so she can see he's overspending on video games, he gets yelled at as they leave the bank.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/29jqh3/make_me_seem_like_an_idiot_at_work_kid_let_me_go/,pettyrevenge,177,

I guess you'll look extra sparkly for the next few weeks.,MyVodka,"I jog around my apartment complex since I have a course set that measures almost exactly two miles so it's easy for me to measure progress.  I run at night but I wear the PT shirts from work that have reflective lettering and department logos on the front, back, and both sleeves.

The path is almost all on the sidewalk, but it crosses the parking lot in two locations.  There are stop signs in the crosswalks and people frequently cross there since it's right next to the community park/pool.

Well, I was running last night and I approached this crosswalk.  I saw this blue Corolla approach and slow down.  I assumed he was going to stop so I continued running.  This guy decided to accelerate and pass me in his oncoming lane, completely blowing the stop sign.  He sped around and disappeared behind some of the buildings.

I followed his path and saw where he parked, I didn't get to confront the guy but I know it was his car since the hood was still warm.

Well, I decided to make another lap and pass by my apartment, where I grabbed my daughters giant bottle of glitter.  I emptied the bottle into the air vent right in front of the windshield, the same vent that sucks air when you use your A/C or defroster.  

Tonight I swung by his car again to see if it was effective.  I shined the light off my phone into his window and saw glitter all over his console, both front seats, and a moderate amount into the rear seat.

So, my sister has a friend, whom I will call Nutjob. Nutjob has a boyfriend whom she's known for about a year and a half. They're both early 20s, and still in university. Now, she's absolutely baby-crazy, and he's not exactly into that sort of thing. I personally think that the debate of whether to have children is something that you really need to establish before you continue your relationship, because it's a big deal, but whatever.

Anyway, apparently Nutjob's been taking his used condoms and...emptying them into her? I don't know how it works, exactly. Just ignore the fact that a lot of condoms have spermicide in them now. No matter what way you want to look at it, it's a pretty fucked-up way to try and get pregnant, almost as bad as poking holes in them.

Fortunately, Nutjob's boyfriend found out. Unfortunately, he didn't know what to do. Dude's kind of still in love with her, even though she's completely out of her mind at this point. He phones me up a couple of nights ago and asks for help dealing with the problem, since I've been in a pretty good relationship for four years and I know how to deal with these kinds of problems. I told him to call her on it and break up with her as soon as possible, because this can actually have more severe ramifications than cheating IMO. I also added that he might want to use a decoy condom filled with tobasco sauce.

Never in my life did I think he'd actually do that.

I assume she's been doing this when it was dark or something, because there's no fucking way you could look at a condom filled with tobasco and say to yourself ""Yes, this is something I want inside of me."" I don't know the exact details. All I know beyond that is that she called my sister in the middle of the night practically screaming, and then my sister called me at about 3am to completely bitch me out over it. I probably didn't do myself any favours by laughing my ass off about it like that. So, it's fair to say that my sister's angry at me again and Nutjob suspects that I had something to do with this. 

I don't care. Lying to your SO about this sort of thing and trying to ""accidentally"" fall pregnant is scummy as shit. I don't think she'll be doing it again any time soon, though.

2014-05-10 12:49:52+00:00,3395,Revenge on Eddie Murphy,Jessie_James,"A long time ago Eddie Murphy was shooting one of his Beverly Hills Cop movies at a location across the street from my (fathers) house.  I was a big fan at the time.  My father was a senior member of the staff at this location as well, so he had arranged to have a little surprise for me.  As this was a busy city location, the movie studios would have to rent space for their trailers in parking lots (like where my dad worked) and put a few in people's driveways and yards.  Our house had a very long driveway with a rear parking area, which fit about 6 trailers.  Our neighbor had a short driveway which fit one trailer, but then opened onto our lawn.  There were no other nearby homes with long driveways for at least a few blocks - they were all much smaller properties.

Anyway, Mr. Murphy's trailer just ""happened"" to be on our neighbors driveway, opening onto our front yard.  Cool!  I got to see him come and go a few times, and was allowed on set.  It was very cool watching them film, and I even noticed a stunt double not wearing a watch when Mr. Murphy was.  I mentioned it to the staff and they actually re-shot a scene because of it.  I was ecstatic to have helped (and yes, the scene made it into the final movie).  

Anyway, my dad suggested I go knock on Mr. Murphy's door and invite him and his entourage to use our pool and hot tub.  At the time I was in 7th grade, so I was just a kid, but I was thrilled to meet a movie star and maybe have him as a guest at our house.  

I knocked and he answered his door, and after I offered ... he told me to fuck off, and slammed the door in my face.  

:(


Yeah, I was pretty much destroyed, and went crying back to my dad.

My dad was slightly less than impressed, and the next day at work he told the movie company what happened, and that they could no longer park their trailers on the business grounds!  They also could no longer use our driveway, and he asked my neighbors to do the same (and they did). They had to stop shooting for a few days to move everything.  As I recall, the nearest location they found to fit all their trailers was about 2 miles away.

I was thrilled my dad stuck up for me.

There is this one stand which is infamous for PMSbitchservice. ie, they throw your change on the counter, and generally very bitch toned. You better have your order ready and enunciate when it's your turn. People put up with their service because, hey, it's tastes good and it's cheap.

So I called in 15 min before my break, and I left my phone number as a reference when I went to pick it up. I get there and braced myself nervously went up to the 50yo PMSbitch to get my food.

&gt;PMSbitch: ""phone.""

&gt;me, thinking the last 4 digits would suffice and please her with my efficiency: ""4567""

&gt;PMSbitch: ""don't have it. full number.""

&gt;me: ""123-4567""

&gt;PMSbitch: ""don't have it. area code.""

lolwut. I looked at the counter where she places all the take-out orders. There's clearly mine, and one other. **2 orders in total**. she was clearly going out of her way to try and juke me. 

at this point, I realized I haven't paid her yet, what's my lost anyways. meh.
&gt;me: ""oh, (I must be at the) wrong place.""

and went to another stand across from hers. she realized what I was pulling and tried to get me back, 
&gt;PMSbitch: ""Oh! I found it! I found it!"", 

IGNOREDDDDDDDDD.
I ordered my food at the other place, and seconds later, my phone rings; oh its her.

full eye contact during the conversation.

The only thing is, he has a lot of bad tattoos. I'm talking knuckle tattoos that say ""Dumpster baby"", vampire bite marks, and the web address of the guy who did his tattoos. The last one is one that this story is about, because my plan originally started as a joke I made that i would buy the domain when it went up for sale and put photoshopped images of him with other men. 

So I get to know him a bit more and he's actually a good guy. Has 2 kids with an ex fiance, and she has been a total bitch. Not telling him where his kids are, leaving them with a 3rd party when she's supposed to have them, and has also left them to go (allegedly) buy and sell drugs. She has an open case with the Department of Family Services and she has failed drug tests twice, yet still has majority custody.

Side note, this woman hates my SIL with a passion. Making up lies and  publicly making threats on social networking sites. 

The Revenge part of this story comes back to those tattoos. You see, he got many of them when he was with his ex, so she has similar tattoos, such as the vampire bites and the web address. Which she has on her ankle.

For shits and giggles I decided to look up the domain and found that it was for sale. I purchased it immediately and thought about what I would put online. If I hadn't just been talking to my sister-in-law about whats going on with his kids, I might have put up the pornographic photoshops and had my fun. But I changed my mind and decided to make it a launch page for their wedding plans and registry. 

So now, this woman has a tattoo that links to her ex's new wedding plans and eventually a nice slideshow devoted to their everlasting love.

so i've been interviewing people here and there, and this guy comes in with a seemingly good resume, so i give him an interview.

when i asked him some technical questions about complex things he'd worked on, he described a setup that was identical to the one i had to repair, and it was a pretty unusual setup. i quickly texted the owner of the other company, and sure enough it was the same guy. on a hunch, i texted a girl i knew - she'd had a boyfriend who'd gotten her pregnant and bailed, leaving her with a lease to pay on her own. i'd only ever heard about him by first name but he fitted the physical description.. IT WAS THE SAME FUCKING GUY. no shit.

i decided to waste his time with the longest, most stressful, awkward, and technically difficult job interview i've ever given, before giving him real hope that he was the best candidate and would most likely get the job, and that for the right person we'd pay for their moving expenses and pay above what was advertised, with bonuses and perks.

**for those asking for proof** , the incident ended up used on our corporate web site as a case study with testimonial: http://www.ionetworks.com.au/case-studies/

**Edit 1 for common questions:**
- he wasn't pursued legally because he took out the servers that logged all the firewall activity.  we realised what he was doing while he was still doing it but were unable to save everything as while the production data was being backed up off-site, live diagnostic/troubleshooting stuff like logs weren't.  all we had was his VPN being connected, which wasn't enough to be sure on, and it would raise questions with PCI/DSS requirements (for storing credit card information)
- yes, it is just an incredible co-incidence that he also knocked up a friend.  she ended up miscarrying so don't worry, he has not reproduced.

**Edit 2 for additional info**
- Part of the 'most awkward interview ever' was when I spent a lot of time in the interview talking about how familiar that setup sounded and that I'd done some contract work to do some emergency repairs for a setup just like it a while ago.

I do remember he was big for a fourth grader, and rumor was he was held back a grade (I never asked him, so I don't know for sure, but it was likely, since he was a fucking moronasshole).

One day, I was getting my Blow Pop out of my backpack and he saw me do it. He walked up to me and called my attention. ""Hey kid, I see you with a Blow Pop every day,"" he said. ""My dad gives me one every day,"" I said. Admitting to a bully that you have an endless supply of what he wants is a terrible idea, but I was young and naïve.

""Give it to me.""

""...no.""

He took it from me before saying another word. I protested and reached for it, and all he did was shove me away and I knew I had lost. He unwrapped it, while staring straight at me, and put the lolly in his mouth like he was trying to seduce my inner rage into a fight. I took Judo for a year when I was around five or six, but I knew that shit wasn't going to save me. Most of what we did in that Judo class was trip other little kids when they're holding you from a set position, and this big little asshole probably wouldn't attack me with a karate chop so I wasn't prepared to trust my martial arts training to prevent me from getting my ass kicked in front of a bus full of peers.

No, instead, I just took it.

The next day, I was getting my lollipop out, and Dickballs McThief came right up to me and collected it, once again unwrapping it in front of me and sticking it in his mouth while maintaining eye contact like he's Cesar Millan and I'm a disobedient chihuahua. On the third day, I decided to eat my lollypop during lunch so I didn't have to give it up to this turd later on. That's when I learned what this little prick was made of.

""Where's my Blow Pop,"" he asked, like an asshole.

""I didn't get one today.""

""I don't care if YOU don't get one. I want MY Blow Pop every day, and YOU are gonna get it for me.""

I tried to put up a verbal fight, but all he did was shove me and press on. All I could do was give in and agree to pay him his Blow Pop tax every day.

The next day, he got his lolly and gave me his stupid patented stare down. And the day after that. And the time after that. I got tired of not having a Blow Pop, so one morning I asked my dad for two, and he said no, that one was enough. I disagreed, and told him I needed two because I had to give one to this kid on the bus. My dad gave me a speech about bullies, and told me I have to resolve that situation, because I can't live in fear and all that crap, but he also stressed that I shouldn't fight him unless he fights me. Good, because I didn't want to fight him.

That day, before school ended, I had a brilliant revenge idea. I went to the bathroom, unwrapped the Blow Pop, unwrapped my pants, and rubbed that candy all over my dick, balls, and asshole. I went to town on that shit. I spread my cheeks, I stretched my sack against it, I even pulled my foreskin back and got my glans all over it. By the time I was done, I had rubbed it on me so much that if someone sucked my dick they'd promptly be arrested for statutory rape, but ALSO, they would be like, ""wow, your penis tastes like a Blow Pop.""

I shoddily re-wrapped the candy and headed to the bus. Like clockwork, Unbeknownst Cocksucker demanded the Blow Pop, and I gave it to him. He did his usual intimidating unwrapping ritual without relenting in his eye contact with me. Then he put it in his mouth.

My laughter was maniacal. He's standing there with the lolly in his mouth, and I'm laughing like a Bond villain. Without waiting for him to ask what's so funny, I yelled, ""I PUT THAT IN MY BUTT!!!!"" The kids in the immediate area started laughing at him, and I just continued to yell what I've done.

""I RUBBED IT ON MY BUTTHOLE!! I PEED ON IT!! [that was a lie, but the general idea is there]""

Kids started mocking him while I kept yelling what I had done in the most delirious tone imaginable, and he just threw the Blow Pop on the ground and started spitting. The bus driver got in on this commotion and wanted to know what was wrong, and like a little pussy, the bully actually told him. I got in trouble for it, and it escalated to the point where my parents were called to the vice principal's office about my behavior. Nothing happened to the bully, as far as I'm aware, but he never *ever* fucked with me again.

And I enjoyed my Blow Pops in peace for another few weeks until I got sick of them.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/20zxvv/23_years_ago_i_had_a_bully_that_was_the_last/,pettyrevenge,291,

She had managed to land a very high paying job in the private sector. She would constantly brag about how she was making ""soooo much money"" and how she had an expensive car. She would tell all her friends they need to get their asses in gear so everyone could be like her. This girl was the definition of ""Bitch""

Fast forward about 2 years, she has now landed a new (higher paying) job with the government. After being with them for about a year she ""hurts"" her back and is on long-term disability for months and there is no sign of her going back to work anytime soon. You would think that someone with an injured back would not do a lot of physical activity like skiing, partying at the bars, etc.  She had a desk job and everyone knew she was faking.

The best part about all this? She was posting pictures and adding comments on Facebook about all the ""fun"" she was having. After months of observing this I did some research and tracked down the name of the insurance company that handles government workers. I filed an anonymous complaint and thought nothing would happen. 

About a year later I found out she had been sued by the government for over $35,000 in claimed wages while she was on disability. She tried to fight it in court, but the insurance company had hired a private investigator and tracked her every move. They had screen grabs of her Facebook statuses as well as photos taken by the investigator from his car of her doing recreation activities proving her back was OK. She lost the fight and had to pay the $35K. She lost her job, went bankrupt and had to move back in with her parents. She is currently a 36 year old unemployed single woman living in an isolated rural area with her parents. 

EDIT: I love the idea from bellewhether about sending her the card. Unfortunately she still doesn't know I did it and no one else does, so I can't send the card. However, an anonymous e-card might work! thanks for the suggestions.

Background:

the local noodle bar has an offer where you can claim a free noodle box on your birthday, and you can claim it 3 days on either side of your birthday, and me and my sister went to claim it since my birthday was 2 days ago.

Situation:

we were waiting in the line for around 5-10 minutes since it was quite long and they only had 1 server, and when we were finally next up to order, some random guy (from now known as butt) just decides to barge infront of us and start ordering.

Revenge:

the guy starts getting his order, cashier confirming the order and making sure he got the prices right, once butt had comfirmed that he had it right, the cashier told him ""Ok sir, now go to the back of the line and don't cut in line again"" and he was furious and went to the back of the line (we were the only ones in line by then, so he went behind us).

The cashier and my sister and I laughed it out, and he upgraded the free box from small to large (we tipped him still, even though the box was completely free).

While we were walking out of the store, we saw the cashier screwing with butt even more by acting as he had just met him, and was making butt say everything again.

TL;DR, random guy cut in line, cashier made him order twice making him say every detail.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1zipfc/cashier_decided_to_have_a_little_fun_with_a_line/,pettyrevenge,74,

I see all these messages between her and this other guy expressing their undying love for each other. So I FaceTime this guy, and explain to him that we're both being played. I told him that I'm going to be out of the picture ASAP, so do he can do what he wants with that information. 

I text her, ""Emergency. Come back ASAP."" She rushes home, and I explain what happened. So now she's out the money for the appointment, and left without a shoulder to cry on. I admit, this is really petty of me, but it feels almost cathartic to give that poor guy a heads up and leave her feeling like a total piece of garbage.

Last night was very cold with very high winds, probably around 35-40 degrees but the wind chill made it unbearable. In the busy rush a very rude and, I'll say ""sassy"" male came out and without getting off his phone asked me for change. Not wanting to give him 20 dollars in 1's (people get upset) I pulled out my wallet to give him some 5's along with some 1's from our till. I'm wearing gloves so handling the money is taking a few seconds longer than this individual would like. Now take in mind the money that we get in tips is all kinds of wrinkled and unorganized (it's in the middle of the shift). I can see that he is shivering from the cold so I try to be quick. That is when he said this:
""This fucking valet is taking forever to count to 20""

He is literally standing on one foot away from me. He wasn't speaking to me, but to the person on his phone. I immediately stop counting and looked him in the eye, meeting his gaze. I put the 5's back in my wallet, and then proceeded to slowly rummage through the wrinkled and folded up $1 bills. I slowly count them out to 20, twice, while still looking him square in the eye. Then go back through, unwrinkle them all of them, making sure none of the edges were folded, and all faced the right way. Then I handed them over. The whole time, he is shivering terribly.

She still lives in the house he bought with his earnings right across the street from us. Even when they were together I never liked her, but her husband became quick friends with my husband and I when they moved in.

She never hid her cheating and used her husbands 15 hour shifts as her ""whore around"" time. Different cars parked in front of the house all night only to disappear 10min before her husband got home. He soon found out and she was the one who demanded a divorce while he wanted marriage counseling. Fine. If you don't live someone then you don't live them. He moved out and left her the house and his beloved dogs that weren't allowed at his new apartment complex.

Immediately she acquired a ""sugar daddy"" to help pay the mortgage and bills, but she still had a slew of lovers, each having a particular night of the week to stay over. It's like a one woman brothel over there, I swear. Now her driveway goes around to the back of the house so we can't always see whose parked there (sometimes they'll park on the street). For whatever crazy reason she believed my husband and I still liked her (we never did in the first place but she thought we did).

The other day I was outside retrieving some things from our car when she comes out with her ""sugar daddy"" to see him to his car. I recognized him, but obviously she didn't know that. She brought him across the street and said ""Hey! DeaditeQueen I want to introduce you to my boyfriend!"". At that moment I switched off my brain filter.

""Oh. Hi! Nice to meet you. Forgive me, but are you the boyfriend with the Benz, the silver pick up, the black pick up, that Rusty Toyota or the silver Expedition? I get you guys all mixed up!""

2013-12-22 16:23:15+00:00,3604,I saw you steal that candy bar.,calicomonkey,"When I was in college I worked the night shift at a gas station. One night a group of 4 high school kids drove in, and it looked like they were on a double date. They were apparently running on fumes and badly needed gas, but didn't have much cash between them. They all came in and emptied the change from their pockets onto the counter and came up with $1.12 total. I punch in $1.12 as the pre-pay amount for their gas and the nice girl who was driving was appreciative that I had helped count out the change -- there were a lot of pennies.

After this the girls go to use the bathroom while the boys peruse the small store. The aisles are angled towards the register so that I can look down them pretty easily. **I see one of the boys clearly take a Snickers bar and place it into his jacket pocket** -- he made absolutely no attempt to hide this action.

I was about to call him out on it, but remembered that they hadn't started pumping their gas yet. As they were walking out the door -- ""have a good night!"" -- I cleared out the pre-pay amount and typed in $0.59, subtracting the $0.53 that I knew the candy bar cost.

I then waited for the fun.

The nice girl starts pumping her gas and when the pump stopped at $0.59 she looks at me through the glass and raises her hand to make the international gesture for WTF. I motion for her to come inside and she's a bit annoyed until I explain that her friend stole a candy bar, so I took the price of the candy bar off of the total amount. 

The look of incandescent rage that crossed her face was beautiful! She took that anger back out to the car and opened the passenger door. Even though I couldn't hear her, I could see her yell animatedly with her hands, and soon she started walking back to the store, candy bar in hand. 

She placed the candy bar on the counter and said thank you, I put $0.53 back on the pump. I could see her still yelling at him as she finished pumping the gas and drove off. 

**TL;DR: High school boy steals a candy bar and I let his date know about it in my own way.**

I download an essay from some website that has nothing to do with our prompt. I then proceeded to change the title and the first paragraph, so that he thinks the essay is legit. Also at the end, I added in this: *I regret that my walnut sized brain cannot muster up the willpower to write a simple three page essay. My apologies.*

I was excited after I sent it to him, but then reminded myself to keep my hopes down, because perhaps he'll realize the essay isn't even mine. To my surprise, he turned it in yesterday morning in class, and even thanked me. I was jumping with joy on the inside. But it gets better-our teacher picked a couple essays at random that she would show on the projector to the whole class. To my luck, one of them was his. 

His face when they read the first page was like that of a person standing in front of a speeding train about to be run over. The teacher showed the whole thing to the class and I was happy the entire day. I heard Q was confronted by the teacher after school, and I didn't see him at school today.

2013-11-14 18:17:53+00:00,2266,You want to do my job? Go for it. Twice.,woahmanda8,"I was reminiscing on my past job today when I remembered a petty revenge story that occurred while I was working last summer. Before university, I worked at a children's birthday party place. It was an awesome job. Playing with kids, getting leftover pizza and cake, and the pay was way better than the minimum wage food service job I'm working now.

Anyways.
Two workers were assigned to each party. There was a lead and an assistant. Most people became leads after working for ~6 months and showing that you can handle the job and communicate well with the parents/kids. While both jobs were nearly the same, the lead got to do a few of the cooler things, such as introducing the rules to the kids before switching gyms (it was actually really fun, we would always make them play Simon Says to get their attention so they would line up), initiating the zipline, and cutting the cake. 

I was SO excited when I finally became a lead. Along with all that, there was a pay raise. It was great.

Here's where things get slightly annoying. There was this girl who worked there, we'll call her Carly, whose mom knew the manager. She worked there much longer than any of us. Like, years. She was known for leaving early, not doing her closing duties, sitting down on the job, etc. Just a general bad employee that none of us really liked because she made our job harder. She never became a lead. Although she was perpetually stuck being an assistant, she liked to play her own little game of trying to take over and act as a lead with the new leads. On multiple occasions I had to work with her, and each time she tried to line the kids up, start zipline without telling me, and one time she even tried to cut the cake. Hell no. (I made sure she didn't get to cut the cake, by the way. Cutting the cake was what I lived for.)

Anyways, one day she pulls out the zipline 15 minutes early. Without telling me. 

Me: ""Hey, it's kind of early for zipline.""

Carly: ""Well, I want to do it early today.""

Me: ""I don't know if that's a good idea, the kids will get bored later if-""

(Carly interrupts): ""Hey (birthday kid), do you want to do zipline?""

Of course, he says yes. Fine. I go with the flow.
Here's where it gets petty and revengy. Carly is a bit (well, moderately) overweight. She tires very easy. I mentioned above that she's often found sitting when we're supposed to be constantly active and energetic.

We start zipline, get all the kids lined up, I explain the rules. It was a large party, 25 kids or so. All around 6-7 years old. 

Me: ""Carly, since you wanted to do zipline, you can lead this one.""

The lead is responsible for holding the kids and running down the gym with them, the assistant only has to hold a rope. This is the worst part of being the lead. It's fucking exhausting having to hold multiple kids up and run to the opposite side of a large gym with them, especially because many of them don't hold onto the bar very tight and parents get pretty upset when you drop their kid. 

Carly: ""..okay.""

So, we go through 25 kids ziplining down a hot gym, and boy oh boy is Carly exhausted. She starts to tell me she's going to get water.

Carly: ""I'm gonna go get some water, I'll-""

Me: ""Wait, we're not done!""

Carly: ""What?""

Me: ""Hey, (birthday boy), do you want to go again?""

He, and all 24 of his 50 lb. friends get excited and get back in line to do the zipline again.

Carly: ""We're only supposed to give them one turn!""

Me: ""Well we started 15 minutes early, so we have plenty of time.""

Commence Carly's second workout of the day.

TL;DR: Made a bunch of kids happy, a bitchy girl got a good workout, and I still got to cut the cake.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1qmoi6/you_want_to_do_my_job_go_for_it_twice/,pettyrevenge,92,

I perked up when I heard her say with a worried look on her face, ""my computer's infected?"" I knew immediately this was a scam call so I told her I'd handle it and took the phone. It was a guy from India in a call center saying he was with Microsoft and I needed to follow his step-by-step instructions to clean up all the viruses on our pc (i.e. give him remote control, steal whatever info they can get, install malware, turn it into a zombie, or whatever else they do with this scam.) 

Now I hate scammers with a passion but I'm especially pissed off because my mom is getting up there in age and isn't as sharp as she used to be and would've fallen for this had I not been there. In fact, she did fall for this exact same scam about a year ago. I had to wipe the computer and told her very plainly that no one will ever, ever call from Microsoft, or for any other internet related issue. Unfortunately her memory isn't so hot these days.   

In a very thick Indian accent this guy tells me how bad the computer is with all its viruses and infections. ""Oh no! Really, I have viruses? How do I fix it?"" I say. He assures me he'll walk me through the clean up process and I express my relief and gratitude. Sweet - I don't have shit to do at the moment.

I actually had turned it off so I would be able to blare the Windows log-on sound to make it convincing. Now, this is like an '04 PC my mom has so the start up time is NOT exactly fast. So after a good while I tell him I'm back up and ready. 

""Ok, sir. Now look at the keyboard and find the WINDOWS KEY and the ""R"" KEY. Please hold these down at the same time. Now please tell me, sir, what do you see?""

""Hmm. My computer turned off again. I held down the main Windows button and the 'R' key just like you told me and it turned off again. I'm sorry, I just don't know what I'm doing wrong."" 

He's getting a little frustrated now. But the beauty is, I'm thinking, this guy probably has to call hundreds of people before he's got a sucker on the line as willing and eager as I am to remedy this particular computer problem. So I do this cycle a full four times, each time giving him more little hints that I think the ""Windows Key"" is actually the power button. By the fourth time I thought for sure he would get it because I was calling it something like, ""the main Windows power button on my Dell,"" but sadly he never did figure it out. He gives up on that and moves on to try something else.

""Ok, sir, forget that, we will try something else."" He goes on to explain that we're going to do a boot-up sequence where I have to press the F8 key *while* the computer is booting back up. Obviously, this could not have worked out better. The chance to continually miss hitting the F8 key in time has me absolutely giddy inside. I assure him I'm ready to hit the key and restart the machine. 

I let it fully boot up and blare the Windows login sound again and say, ""OK! It's back on and I'm hitting the key now."" He sighs with more frustration. ""You have to do it WHILE THE COMPUTER IS STARTING BACK UP,"" he explains. So I apologize again and feign frustration myself while holding back my unfettered delight. 

The next round he is more careful to make sure I'm hitting the key *during* the boot-up sequence. So I'm punching away on the space bar key as loud as I can during the boot-up, and after a couple minutes or so here comes that beautiful Windows start up sound again and he lets out an even louder, more frustrated sigh.

""SIR. Did you hit the **F8** key?"" 

Well I've gone this far, I think to myself, I may as well lay on another level of frustration by insulting his English. ""Yes, I was hitting the ""S"" and ""H"" keys the whole time! I don't know what went wrong."" 

Yep, that did it. ""**No**, no, no, the F-8 key. The **F** - **8** key. Sir, look at your keyboard. Do you see the F8 key?"" 

""OH....Oh...the *F-8* key,"" I say. ""Yes, I see, I'll try again."" We sit there waiting a few more minutes. I repeat the whole process, this time after the start-up sound I tell him I hit the ""F"" and ""8"" keys but again nothing happened. Holy Shit. He's fuming at this point but trying as hard as he can to hold it back. Right then I heard my mom call that dinner was ready. Normally I would have blown off dinner for something this much fun but we'd grilled out these beautiful ribeyes and I wasn't about to let mine get cold. I tell him I'm really sorry, I have to go to dinner now and I will have to fix it later. And with that, after this 35 minute phone call, I just hang up. 

I sit at the table admiring this beautifully marbled steak and tell my folks it was all a scam and I was just wasting his time. The phone rings. My mom jumps up and says, ""I got it."" In the sweetest voice, my mom said, ""I'm really sorry but we are having family dinner at the moment and I have a rule that everyone has to sit down together,"" and after a moment listening to his reply she hangs up and sits back down. 

""What'd he say,"" I ask. Mom replies, ""He said, 'Fuck your family dinner'.""

2013-10-21 15:47:44+00:00,2184,Librarian Revenge,tmtreat,"Back in college, my suitemates decided to prank a friend of ours who lived on the floor above us.  During an entire Sunday afternoon, 8 of us blew up balloons which we stored in one of our bedrooms, and once our friend went to work on Monday evening (at the campus library), we filled her room from floor to ceiling with the balloons. 

Ironically, as a relatively direct result of this prank, she and I began dating.  She mentioned (playfully) that she would ""get me back"" for the balloon prank, but that I would probably never realize what she had done.

Her revenge was so subtle that I, indeed, had no idea that anything had been done to create the minor annoyance that plagued me for the remainder of our time at college.  She sewed a [library book security tag](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/RFID_and_magneto-acoustic_tags.JPG/220px-RFID_and_magneto-acoustic_tags.JPG) into the inside of my backpack, so every time I left the library, I set off the alarm and had my backpack searched.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1owoni/librarian_revenge/,pettyrevenge,146,
2013-10-05 17:11:46+00:00,2458,Take a picture of my patient? Enjoy shopping for a new phone.,CejusChrist,"So, this happened last month, but I am finally getting a chance to type it out.

I work as an EMT in a decent sized city. We tend to run call to call, and get all sorts of calls. One night, we get called for a call coded as a Psych. A gentleman had been having a bad run of luck, and was feeling depressed. So my partner and I show up, and I begin to speak with the man. The gentleman begins to tell me about how he had been kicked out of his home, by his wife, for drug use. This caused him to feel depressed, and spiral into the world of homelessness and drugs. He had a revelation earlier, and he wanted help, so he called us.

I move him into the back of my ambulance, and the guy begins to break down, crying because he feels hopeless, worthless, and he can't stop apologizing for wasting my time. I am in the middle of trying to calm him down, and have a conversation with him while I take a blood pressure, and begin to get a little bit of demographic information, when I hear my partner yell from the front seat.

I look around, and in the back window, I see a hand, and an iPhone in the corner of the window. I begin to see red, as I realize what the guy behind my ambulance is doing. Not only is he taking a picture of me, he is taking a picture of a man who is already feeling like he has hit rock bottom, and is sobbing in the back of my ambulance. The man realizes as well that he is being photographed, and says something along the lines of ""If I was them, I would be taking pictures of someone as useless as me as well."" This is when I have a stroke of genius.

At my company, we run van-type ambulances. The rear doors open like they do [in this picture.](http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/995999/2/stock-photo-995999-ambulance-van.jpg) The right side door opens first, allowing the left side to open afterwards. The handle is right next to where I was sitting, which was on the bench inside. So I tell my patient to hold on a second. I grab the handle, and kick the door open with all my strength, and hop out right afterwords.

The door flies into the guys hand, and his phone goes 10 feet into the road, with a satisfying crack that can only be the sound of a screen breaking upon sidewalk and pavement. I give a halfhearted apology stating that I didn't see him, and that I was trying to find my jump bag. The kid, who appeared to be early twenties, and drunk, was too dumbfounded to say anything. I get back in the ambulance, and we begin to pull away. I look back, to see the kid pick up his phone, look at it, and throw it against the wall, in what I assume was a post-screenbreaking act of rage. Felt good man.

TLDR; Drunk frat kid took a picture of my depressed patient. 'Accidentally' threw my door open, breaking his iPhone.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nsk4f/take_a_picture_of_my_patient_enjoy_shopping_for_a/,pettyrevenge,213,
2013-10-04 13:58:46+00:00,2625,"If you're a jerk at the grocery store, you don't get any cake.",Spagster,"I was at the grocery store yesterday getting some stuff for this weekend when I stumbled upon something that really ticked me off.  I'm just hanging out, minding my own business looking for stuff on the list my wife made me, when I heard something in the next aisle.  Sounded like an argument.  I'm a curious guy so I scadoodled on over to see what was going on.  Some middle-aged soccer mom looking bitch was absolutely tearing into this cherub-faced kid about them not carrying the type of cake mix she wanted.  

""This is ridiculous!  What kind of place is this!  I need that cake mix!  Get your ass to the backroom and look for it again!  I'm having a party tomorrow and have to have it!""  The poor guy looked shell-shocked.  If he was anything over 16 years old I would be so surprised.  But I'll give it to him, he handled it pretty well.  

""I'm sorry ma'am...we don't have any.  I already looked...we have the store brand, though...it's basically the same stuff...I'd be happy to get some of that for you?""  he replied.  Good on you, young store employee.

""NO.  I DON'T WANT OFF-BRAND.  GET ME YOUR MANAGER.""  Cake bitch was losing her shit.  I know cake is awesome, but com'on lady, you're being a big ol' turd.

The kid's manager comes out, chats with the lady who continues to freak out, but eventually gets her just to take the store-brand cake mix.  He and his employee walk past me, staring straight ahead with the eyes fixed on the empty void ahead of them like only someone who works in a retail job can do.

I was feeling a little bit feisty yesterday.  I can be a bastard-coated-bastard with bastard filling sometimes, but I absolutely hate it when people are rude to store employees/waiters/people they thing are 'beneath them'.  Really, really pisses me off. That bitch wasn't getting away with it.  I stalked her through the store, never getting too close to set off alarm.  She moved from aisle to aisle getting more things for her impending bitch-festival, not knowing that a predator was about to strike.  She got some pretty delicious looking things, I might add...but I wasn't after those.  I had my target.  I was going to take that fucking cake mix.  

I knew exactly where it was in her cart.  Her cart was getting pretty full so I decided to move in for the kill. The petty-revenge gods were on my side because somehow the cake mix wasn't covered by anything.  She turned her back on her cart and bent down to get something off the bottom shelf.  I rushed in, very nonchalantly snagged the cake mix out of her cart, and moved on.

Of course I had to watch to make sure she checked out.  In fact, I made sure I was right behind her.  She didn't notice a thing.  For how big of a deal that damn cake mix was to her, I was surprised how little attention she payed to what she put on the conveyor belt.  

I smiled all night thinking about how she got home, unloaded all of her groceries, but couldn't find the cake mix.  She probably went back out to her car, looked around, maybe under the seats...but guess what lady, it's not there.

That cake mix deserved better than her.  *I* bought it.  It was confetti cake mix.  It might have been for a kids party for all I know, but I don't care.  I made it when I got home and it was fucking delicious.

2013-10-02 23:55:32+00:00,2671,"I can hear you, Asshole......",Antigon35,"So a friend of mine, we’ll call him Daniel, is deaf and has been his whole life. Daniel was fired from his job by a manager that openly mocked him for being deaf. So when he needed to go to the unemployment office he asked me to go with him because I have been trying to learn sign language and we can communicate pretty well. We get there and there’s only us and a very elderly old man (EM) sitting in the waiting area. All of the chairs are set up so that we are facing the only receptionist in the room. There seems to be some sort of issue with EM’s paperwork so every few minutes EM would walk up to answer a question of the receptionists’ or to sign what she asked him to sign and then he would sit back down. Daniel being the sweet guy he is, would reach forward and hold the man’s chair every time he went to sit back down. 

So me and Daniel are signing back and forth just shooting the shit when a few other people come in, including a very loud, obnoxious, white trash couple. Now, as I previously stated, I am just learning sign language so I was concentrating on what I was signing and understanding what Daniel was signing so at first I didn’t notice white trash couple plop down in the seats behind us. Then I heard it “derrr… derrr… I’m a deafie….derr”. I glance behind me without moving my head and in my peripheral vision I can see white trash male mocking Daniel and imitating the noises that Daniel makes when he laughs or gets into a story. White Trash bitch apparently thinks this is hilarious. I realize that because I am super concentrating, I haven’t said anything or given them any idea that I am not deaf.  I take a look at the receptionist who looks mortified but seems not to know what to do. 

Now nothing would have made me happier than to cause a huge scene but I knew Daniel was already self conscious about getting fired so I did the next best thing. I waited until EM went to sit down again, Daniel reached forward to hold his chair, I spun around in my chair, looked white trashy 1 &amp; 2 and yelled as loud as I could “WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM!?!” White Trash douche’s jaw drops in shock and the bitch went white as a sheet. I just stared at them. Daniel suddenly realizes I am looking at the white trash couple and signs “What’s wrong?” I told him they kicked my chair. He signs “Asshole” and glares at them. 

I guess they felt uncomfortable enough that they decided to slink out of the building. Fuck you and your unemployment check.  

Edit 1: Concerning the amount of posts regarding legal action against Daniel's workplace, At the time Daniel couldn't prove that he had been fired for his disability. The Manager claimed it was for him being lazy and tried to say that Daniel had drawn a penis on the white board in the back that he sometimes used to communicate (which he hadn't). So Daniel went for unemployment while his friends back at his job pulled some strings. I want to get Daniel to post his revenge story for getting his job back b/c I don't think I could do it justice. It's pretty great.


Thanks for the great responses!

I'm allergic to bee stings, we were at least 45 minutes from the nearest medical facility, and most of our co-workers were non-English speaking production workers. He was the assistant general manager, and he tried to write me up for refusing to walk into an enclosed area that had several large Yellow Jacket nests in it. This was on a hot August afternoon, when the are the most aggressive toward potential intruders/food.

I got some Yellow Jacket attractant that's made for bait traps, and put the liquid on the headband of his hard hat. (It is a food manufacturing plant, and everybody - even the CEO and executives - are required to wear them in most areas of the facility).

He couldn't figure out why the Yellow Jackets kept flying in his face. They wold get aggressive and start biting and stinging when he started swatting them away. He finally quit a few weeks later. He tried to file for unemployment, but the company fought him and used his own documents against him: He put in writing that the Yellow Jackets weren't a problem, and that I was using my allergy as an excuse to avoid working.

I actually heard him say, ""But...but...I didn't mean it like that!""

The HR manager noticed I was keeping close tabs on what happened to the guy, and asked me if I knew anything about it. I said I didn't - that the wasps must have known he was an asshole, and the smell of shit attracted them.

The HR guy said something like, ""Well, serves him right. He's always been an asshole. We couldn't fire him because his dad is one of the co-op owners.""

It made my whole week better.

I think I get it now:  In Shelly's world you push a button and money comes out.  Anytime she wanted to party, all she had to do was take 2 hours out of her day to mow my lawn, stop by my office, and she instantly got $50.  Next day broke?  Mow the lawn again, pass Go, collect another $50.  I think she was confused and even hurt when I put a stop to it.

""Silas"" came to my work and threatened me with a bullshit lawsuit but I think he was white-knighting for Shelly.  They have a kid together, so I don't blame him.  But I could not resist seeing what would happen if I confronted him.

Instead of calling I decided to get up early this morning and go to the law firm where Silas had a job.  The business card he gave me just said ""The Offices of Legal Guy, Legal Eagle, and Law Dude"" (you can substitute the names of actual attorneys here, none of which are Silas).

As soon as I walked in the front door I saw Silas sitting at the back of the front room.  He looked up, panicked, and I swear to Zeus, he skulked out of the room like he'd shit himself.  Went into an office and closed the door behind him.

Now my brother had already told me that he knew Silas worked for a law firm (Shelly had told him).  He couldn't remember what Silas did there, but we reasoned that Silas couldn't possibly be a lawyer because he graduated from a 2-year community college just two years ago.  The timing, you see.

I asked the receptionist who ""that guy at the back"" was, and she said ""his name is Silas, he is one of our best paralegals"".  I asked if that meant he could sue somebody, and she laughed.  Yeah, that's what I thought.

I asked if I could talk to him, and she said I'd be better off talking to an attorney, and that Law Dude and Legal Eagle were in the building... no thanks, I really need to talk to Silas.

She said ""Is this a personal thing?"" and I said well, sorta, and she whispered to me, ""Look, Silas has already gotten in trouble once this week for 'personal' stuff.  Can you wait until lunch, when he's out of the office?""

Uh, no.  He came to MY office, tried to embarrass ME, no way in hell I'm letting him get off that easy...

If I'd thought ahead of time, I would've taken today off.  I could only wait half an hour for him to come back to his desk (yes, I'm a sucker), but he stayed put in that closed office, and I had to get to work myself.  I wrote a note for the receptionist to give to Silas:  

I'LL BE BACK AT 12:45 ON MY LUNCH BREAK.  IF YOU'RE BUSY OR GONE, I'M SURE ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS HERE CAN HELP ME INSTEAD.

He showed up at my office at 12:20.

He closed my door and sat down and looked like he was about to cry.  He couldn't even look at me, but he mumbled how he was trying to spend more time with his son, and he believed some things that weren't true, and how very sorry he was, and how his life was falling apart.  He said he was trying to get custody of his kid but it was hard to do because he 1) was trying to go back to school, which took time and money and 2) was not a woman.  His words, not mine.

Fuuuuuck.  He'll make a GOOD lawyer someday.  Almost made ME cry.

We started talking about the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  I told him how Shelly had mowed every few days, and I was refusing to pay her for the last day because she didn't do shit except sit in her car for an hour.  He said that was his fault, she had called him while she was waiting for me that day, and she was in a panic because she had been seen breaking into my house and she --

Wait. What?

He calmly continued that she said she had broken into my house and that she was all upset, because she had taken a laptop --

WHAT???

He said calm down, she put the laptop back, but she was upset because the neighbors had seen her climb through my window and she was worried she was going to get arrested.  I asked why she didn't just leave that day, then.  He said she was afraid that would make her look ""guilty"".

Oh.  My.  God.

He said that he had told her to wait until I arrived, and to explain.  She told him that she was going to try to get into my house once I got home, so that ""her fingerprints would have a reason to be there"".  Well that explains why she was so pushy and insistent on getting inside.

Wait, wait.  HOW did she put the laptop back?  ""She went in through the window twice.  She said she left the front door open so she could say that you left your door open, and that was why your laptop was missing.  I told her that wasn't a good idea.""

NO SHIT, SHERLOCK!

I really, really want to hit this guy, but I manage to stay polite, and ask him nicely if he would mind telling the police that Shelly admitted to him that she went through my window.  I omit the part about the neighbors saying they ""didn't want to get involved"" (I think Shelly brought her kid to along a few times she mowed and they saw, and felt bad for her).  He says he doesn't want to make ""an already ugly situation even uglier"".  I remind him that if he wants custody of his son, this would be a good start.  He says ""I'll think about it"".

I resist the urge to get up and dance.

[Then this happened.]

(A friend of mine that works for the town newspaper gave me this.)

Shelly got picked up this afternoon - she was speeding and got pulled over.

Couple of things you might notice from that press release:

- She's not being charged with breaking and entering because, according to the investigator I talked to earlier, ""if I left my window open she didn't technically break in"".

- The cops are claiming that I had ""complained of a missing laptop"" the day that I called them.  No I didn't.  I didn't notice anything missing that day.  I wouldn't have known she was even in my house until my neighbors told me they saw her break in.  I'm guessing this is to make the cops look less like idiots.  I love how they called it ""an investigation"", like they had actually done their job.

- Shelly apparently told the cops that she had ""temporarily lived"" at my house.  My brother used to live with me right after our dad died, and he and Shelly dated during that time, and she slept over more than a few times, but she never paid rent or anything.  It's possible she thought she could tell the cops some excuse about how she was my roommate.  This pisses me off more than anything she did before.  When she was arrested she gave her mom's address as her permanent residence.  I think she and her son had been staying there since Silas kicked her out.

She made bail immediately - I would bet Silas paid it out of guilt, but I can't be sure.  I *do* know that she left her kid at her mom's house and that no knows where she is right now.  I really, really hope she doesn't skip town, but I wouldn't be surprised.

Guess she'll owe Silas some money.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1l7s1h/update_on_the_update_stupid_bimbo_scams_me_brags/,pettyrevenge,278,

I was initially drawn to the apartment I'm currently living in because it was extremely cheap and on the second floor (this is a house converted into two living units). I immediately signed the lease and everything was dandy for the first few weeks. However, I had taken notice of the neighborhood riff raff and was wary to keep my distance. I wasn't exactly scared of a bunch of young teens, but after observing their absolutely appalling nature, i tried to give them no excuse to fuck  with me through vandalizing my car or apartment.

Well, not so long ago, I was sitting on my second story porch, enjoying a cigarette after a long tedious shift, when the teens decided to fuck with me. At first, i didn't realize they were speaking to me, until one of them called out ""hey you indian fag!"" Now even though I'm not indian, people often assume i am because of my skin tone, so I'm aware they're attempting to heckle me. I look up and merely raise my eyebrows in acknowledgment, when one of them kicks over my (full) garbage cans and tells me to get on my knees and pick up my trash you (insert random racist slurs here). They laugh and leave. Knowing that I'll be fined by the city if i dont clean up the mess, i begrudgingly clean up the mess. It was while i was kneeling among the strewn garbage that my revenge came to fruition. 

A few nights later, I was sitting on my porch again waiting for my targets to arrive. Sure enough, the pack of them comes strutting down the road talking shit and fucking things up. When they get to my house, I shout at them to keep it down and that theyre being obnoxious. Just as i had planned, they took my bait, and the one who had kicked over my trash cans a few days earlier told me that i was a fag and aimed a full forced kick at my trash cans. Little did he know that i had filled them to the bursting point with packed down rocks and dirt, making them extremely heavy and almost unmovable. I savored the moments leading up to contact and burst out laughing when the garbage can failed to move and the kid howled out in pain when his foot connected. Judging from the time he spent on the ground clutching his foot and the fact that he limped away on the verge of tears, I'm assuming he broke a toe or two. i slept like a fucking king that night.

The one open seat was next to a man who was reading. This was not a shared couch - these were two separate seats with an end table in between them. I quietly sat down and opened my computer. The reading man gave me an incredibly dirty look and let out a loud ""how dare you"" type sigh. 

For the next ten minutes, I made no noise or significant movement other than some light key tapping. Yet he continued to audibly be annoyed at me, even going so far as to mutter ""come on"" in my direction when I shifted my weight. Finally, when the two girls across from us left, he loudly and purposefully gathered up his belongings and went over to one of the now empty chairs in a huff.

A few minutes later, he got up to go to the bathroom, reserving his seat with his book. Just then, a woman with a toddler approached me and asked if the seat next to me was taken. 

""Sorry, I'm waiting for my wife,"" I lied. ""But one of the seats across from me is open.""

The reading man returned from the bathroom to find the seat next to him loudly occupied by a woman with a toddler on her lap, watching a cartoon on an ipad with no headphones. 

TLDR; Starbucks is not your living room, people can sit wherever they please. And I've never met someone who I can't out-asshole.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1l10su/sorry_this_seat_is_taken/,pettyrevenge,132,

I had the same roommate for two years of on-campus housing at college.  We were good friends (and still are), though, as with any roommate, there were always small things that bugged each of us about the other - simple things one ought to let go.  My roommate, let's call him NJ was an awfully friendly guy but had a bad habit of eating things that did not belong to him, without asking or ever acknowledging the fact that he ate them.  I found this very rude and, after bringing it up on several occasions, I realized that he had no plan to stop, for he was one of those “share everything” types.  NJ was a social butterfly, easily peer pressured, and thus always ready to get supremely drunk and go party on any and all given nights.

One night, I came home to find my what-would-have-been munchies were gone, the wrapper for which was in the trash.  He was out, drinking heavily as always, and I knew he would come home wasted and fall right asleep.  In this, I found the outlet for my petty revenge.  The small annoyances he caused me of having to walk back to the convenience store (or wherever) to replace the snacks were only so annoying because they were constant, so my revenge must be a constant, small annoyance as well.  With that in mind, I stuffed his pillowcase full of magazines and hid all bedding in his closet aside from a small blanket.  He came stumbling home a few hours later and, as I predicted, fell right asleep.  He didn't notice his brick-like pillow at all!

NJ woke up the next day cold with a sore neck, wondering why the fuck his pillowcase was stuffed with magazines and where all his sheets were.  I told him that he came home ranting about pillows or something and that he was shifting all his books around as I was trying to sleep, making a lot of noise by his closet, too.  For the next few months, I did this every time he went out drinking; effectively convincing him that he had a drunken habit of replacing his pillow with magazines and hiding all his bedding.  The laugh it gave me made the short walks to the convenience store for snacks worth it.

**EDIT 1:**  I'm glad you are all enjoying my first story! To clear a couple things up, he never found out and I have no intention of telling him.  Also, we shared a room (2 twin xl beds) with one mini-fridge - we didn't have separate rooms - which is why hiding food was not really an option.

2013-08-18 01:32:50+00:00,2151,"Just let me finish unloading my shopping cart, lady.",Zerbo,"So I'm at the checkout stand in the grocery store, cart completely full of groceries. I start unloading my things onto the conveyor belt, pretty standard. I'm not even a quarter of the way through loading everything up when this hugenormous, quivering hambeast of a woman comes panting into line behind me. She immediately hefts two 36-packs of Mountain Dew onto the conveyor belt behind my stuff. No divider or anything, she just stands there and sweats. I was a bit dumbfounded at first, because here I was with my cart still full of groceries that need to be put on the belt and now her cases of soda were taking up any available room. Having never been faced with this particular breach of grocery checkout protocol, I nodded to my cart and told her, ""Uh, I've still got a few things to load up, here.""

She glared at me and huffed, ""Well I only have two things, so you should have let me go ahead of you, you rude shit.""

This lady. The hell. Not only had I already been loading everything up, but the clerk had begun ringing up the items well before she had even truffle-shuffled her way over to the line... if we'd gotten there at the same time, sure, I would have let her go ahead. But apparently she could NOT wait to lug that Mountain Dew out of her cart and onto the belt. Being generally non-confrontational, I cracked an eyebrow at her comment and tried to load up more items Tetris-style. When it became apparent that there was simply no more room to be had, I turned and asked her, ""You mind moving that stuff back a bit so I can get the rest of my groceries up here?""

Still panting from the intense exertion of lifting two cases of soda, she responded with, ""I'm not moving a goddamn thing.""

At this point, that little voice in my head that was saying ""Hey Zerbo, don't be an asshole to this lady"" was now saying, ""Dude, just do it."" So I narrowed my eyes, and without a word lifted up both cases of soda and put them back into her shopping cart. While she asks me what the hell I'm doing and flips out at the realization that she will once again have to put her body through the grueling exercise that is lifting two cases of soda, I finish getting my items loaded onto the now-unoccupied conveyor belt. While swiping my card to finish the transaction, she begins bumping my hip with her shopping cart. On purpose. Repeatedly. Like a child. I turn to her again, and once again I don't say a thing. But this time, I reached into her cart and ripped the cardboard handles off her cases of soda. Brutally. Like I was the lion of the checkout lane and those sodas were the innards of a dying gazelle. While I'd only intended to rip the handles off to make them harder to lift, I had instead compromised the structural integrity of both boxes and all the cans of soda within came tumbling out inside her cart. So she began shrieking with indignant rage, and I tried my hardest not to laugh. By that time, my transaction was done, and I went on my merry way while the rest of the store stared at this blubbery gravy boat of a woman having a rage stroke over her soda.

2013-08-15 18:52:08+00:00,2331,"""Busy. Sorry.""",coffeeandmuffins,"Several months ago I befriended a girl, Lindsay. I'm not usually the type to become fast-friends with people, but I was only working part time and had a lot of free time to fill.

One night we're out having martinis when I start talking about a hot bartender at a local establishment. She tells me that it's her ex-boyfriend and we kind of laugh it off. Later that night she asks me to send him a Facebook message, indicating that I want to have sex with him. She says she wants to see if he'd ""be a whore"" and ""do something like that."" Obviously she's not over it even though it'd been a year. Well, I send the message. I sort of laugh about it and she looks at me all serious and says, ""You wouldn't actually do anything with him right? Since we're such good friends and all."" I nod and the night carries on.

The next weekend I get a response from Lindsay's ex saying he'd noticed me before, we should get together, etc. I ignore it because, well, that's what friends do. That same weekend Lindsay starts spending all of her time with some new guy. For two weeks she ignores my calls and texts - sometimes responding with a short ""busy. sorry."" (same message every time... ""busy. sorry."")

After two weeks she starts hanging out with another girl (who she would talk badly about when she was with me), effectively ""replacing"" me. I see her posts on Facebook about how much she loves her new friend and blah blah blah. Normally, I'd just let it go because I really didn't care but something about her fake-ness just irked me. Then I remembered the Facebook message to her ex.

I messaged him back and we've been sleeping together for a month now. One of her other friends saw us together at the bar and told her. She texted me over and over, asking me if I was sleeping with her ex. Finally I responded - ""busy. sorry.""

2013-08-14 15:03:14+00:00,2841,Neighbor kids kicked my cat and broke a couple ribs,Decyde,"Someone told me to cross post my comment here from yesterday.

A couple of kids who lived in my neighborhood who were around 10-12 years old kicked my cat while it was laying out in front of my porch sun bathing.  I was looking out the window while I saw them walk by and do it and when I opened the door, they took off running.  My cat limped up onto the porch and I could obvious tell it was hurt so I took it up to the vet who gave it an x-ray and confirmed she had a couple broken ribs but no internal organ damage.

This whole thing happened at about 4:30 pm and I ended up getting home at 7:00 pm.  When I got home, I put Bonkers in the house and went down to talk to the kids parents about what they did.  They told me that their kids wouldn't do something like that and I must have been mistaken.  I told them that I wasn't and I wanted to make sure they were disciplined for what they did.  She told me again that her kids wouldn't' do something like that so I went home and called the police.

The police came and got my statement and talked to the parents.  They denied everything and then came and told me there was little they could do.  I could try filing in small claims court to recoup my vet bills but I told him there was next to no way I'd win and he apologized to me and hoped my cat would get better.

I went to work the following day and told my co-workers about the incident and they felt sorry too for my cat.  I got pissed off to the point where I wasn't going to let them get away with it.  The day after this, I got off work and stopped by the hardware store and bought some bolt cutters.  I waited till about 2 am and went and stole both of their bikes off their porch and put them in my garage.

I went to work and thought about dumping them on the other side of the city but instead, I decided to cut them up instead.  When I got home, I took them apart and cut them on my work bench and tossed the crankshaft and bolts in the car wash dumpster a couple blocks away.  I waited till Friday night and dumped them down the street in the field they liked to play at on the weekends.  

I was on my porch most of Saturday when I saw them crying and dragging their cut up bike pieces home to their parents.  I saw the police come over to their home later in the day but I was sure they told them that there was no proof I did it so they didn't stop by and talk to me.  In the end, my cat didn't get to go out side the rest of the year and they didn't get bikes to play with the rest of summer.

This happened about 10 years ago and my cat was 7 at the time.  She lived to be 11 before she passed away in her sleep one night.

2013-08-08 12:44:13+00:00,2511,I can't go to lunch at 12:30? You sure about that?,TimmaDee,"I work in a call centre, I'm part of an 8 man team that work 12 hour shifts. We are trained more extensively than the other people working on the desk as we need to be able to work solo without support, so we get looked upon by our colleagues as superior/replacement managers when our team leader isn't in. 

One of my 12 hour colleagues loves it, chicken-guy felt superior before he went 12 hour and it probably hasn't helped. He often forgets that he isn't superior to me. One day he took it upon himself to do the lunches. He asked if I wanted a specific time and I told him 12:30, it was another colleagues leaving day and we were going for a pub lunch to say goodbye to her. He told me ""I'm going at 12:30, you can go at 1:30 or 2:30.""

I politely declined his offer and told him why I wanted to go at this time, he replied ""Tough shit, bitch, I'm going at 12:30 because that's when not-Tesco finishes cooking their deli chicken. You can go at 1:30.""

The bitch bit was unnecessary, I'm a dude for starters, so I agreed to go at 3:30, with the full intention of going at 12:30. This meant that the other lunches where filled out from 12:30 - 3:30 and during this 3 hour period no one would be able to go on lunch at the same time.

I emailed my manager and said ""You know it's leaving-girl's leaving lunch today, you mind if I go to lunch at 12:30 with them?""
I got a reply minutes later saying ""Sure, I'll give you a lift.""

Manager pops over to the desk at about 12:20 and say's ""Are you ready to go?"" I grabbed my wallet, put myself on lunch and left without saying anything to [guy], he just watched with a ""what is happening"" look.

We get back about an hour later, I sit at my desk and he is just staring at me. I check my emails, and he's sent an email to the manager that just took me to lunch and BCC'd me in. the general jist of it was ""I made the decision, he should respect me, blah blah blah, I'm more important.""

Skip a few hours later, he's back from lunch when the manager calls im in to the meeting room to tear into him about ""Acting superior to his colleagues."" that wasn't the best part though.

2013-07-31 13:26:15+00:00,2190,Almost push me onto the tracks? Be 15 minutes late,kamakawiwo,"So I'm doing my morning commute from the suburbs into the city. I get to the platform about 8-10 minutes before the 7:16 express train which arrives in the city a little after 8. At 7:12, there is a local which arrives at 8:15. At 7:12, the local still was not at the platform. I am standing towards the edge of the platform because I was one of the first ones there (I was behind the yellow line which is the area on the edge of the platform they reccommend you do not stand on because it is an unnecessary danger being that close to the tracks). The way it works is that the first people stand towards the front of the platform so they get on first, classic first come-first serve. 
 
At 7:15, this woman comes pushing past everyone on the platform. She goes behind me and, I don't know if she only meant to nudge me, didn't see me, or meant to push me because she was having a bad day. I stumbled forward and almost fell on the tracks. I was starting to catch myself but I realized I was probably going to have to jump down onto the tracks then climb back up to avoid falling on the metal tracks onto my face. I was going slow enough that some nice person behind me grabbed my backpack and stopped my forward momentum. I thanked the man for his kind action and he said loudly how obnoxious that lady was. She either didn't or pretended not to hear.
 
I realized because she arrived at 7:15, she didn't know the 7:12 hadn't come yet, so I thought of a quick revenge plan. I moved towards her so I was next to her and at 7:16, the local arrived. As it was pulling into the station, she said aloud to no one in particular, ""this is the express, right?"" I said ""yes ma'am"". Because she pushed her way past everyone and was at the front, she made sure to rush and be the first one on. No one else followed her. The conductor said ""delayed 7:12 local"" but becuase she had moved SO fast to get the seat she wanted, the doors closed before she got out and left me a glaring look. I just kinda smirked and people around me chuckled. The 7:16 arrived 2-3 minutes later.

2013-07-30 12:24:21+00:00,3559,Scumbag loses most of his friends and a job opportunity. Revenge is sweet.,CFO422,"There's this Facebook group I'm part of. There are some close friends in there, that's why I'm there. There are about 25 people in this group, five of which are good friends. The group plans all kinds of things; parties, friendly soccer tournaments, clubbing and whatnot. There's this guy, let's call him Steve. Steve thinks he's the alpha male of the group. He uses performance enhancing drugs to be 'a beast' in the gym. This guy completely flipped out towards his sister on Facebook, because she expressed her concern towards his drug use. It was very verbal and extremely rude. He also stole an iPhone 5 last weekend, that's Steve. I don't know if any people in the Facebook group actually like him, but he's there for most of our events. Now I have zero respect for assholes like him, but one rotten apple in a group of 25 is not going to ruin anything for me, so I put up with it. He once hysterically laughed at me while working out at the gym because I was struggling. It was my first week. It demotivated me, but I started saving up towards revenge. This was about a year ago, fast forward to last week. He proudly links to a status update on Facebook, through the group. It's an irrelevant update of him, containing the word 'cancer.' It was something like ""I had a cancer-hard workout this morning"". In our native language it sounds better, 'cancer' is sometimes used as an adjective. 

Some girl I don't know commented on his status asking him why he had to use the word 'cancer'. He starts raging towards this girl, as per usual. He uses the word even more, because he is an alpha male of course. For no apparent reason he flips out completely. 

The girl then states she is suffering from cancer for the second time. Even though I know this asshole, I presumed he'd stop after that. He didn't. He literally stated she might as well be dead and the cancer should ideally spread to her entire family. 

He proudly links this to the entire group. There are mixed reactions, but most of the people think he crossed the line. The subject is dropped soon and everyone starts talking about something else. But I couldn't leave it at that. I wanted revenge, for myself but especially for that poor girl with cancer. I took screenshots of his comments and saved them.

And friday, the perfect opportunity for revenge presented itself. He posted in the group that he was invited for a job interview at a local company. I'm not sure if I crossed the line with the following, but I stand by what I did. I printed out the screenshots onto paper, put them in an envelope, and sent them to the small business where he was to be interviewed for a job. I anonymously addressed them to the personnel manager. 

He made another status this morning. When he showed up for the interview, the interviewer showed him the screenshots and told him this was no behaviour he'd tolerate in this business. Steve went batshit crazy again and he said he knew it had to be someone from the group. Many people laughed and that made him quit the group and unfriend everyone.

I've been smiling the entire day. That asshole had it coming.

2013-07-20 18:57:49+00:00,2135,A story about how an entire island got revenge on two guys harassing a girl with downs syndrome,Dysler,"So this is a story about what happend last summer on an island by the swedish west coast.
It is a very popular destination for rich swedes and norweigans during summer, and is packed with bars and fancy resturants.
Although, the people working there all know eachother well.

There is a very popular bar on this island, who has a regular with downs syndrome. She is there 2-3 times a week, always happy and loved by all. She has been on the island every summer for years, so all the staff and people living there knows her.
                                                            
Last year, during the monday of the busiest week of the year (packed with rich, loud people with big boats) two norweigan guys in their 40s started harassing and making fun of the regular with downs. 
The staff saw what happend, and threw them out. But the girl was in tears, and everyone was mad. The owner of the place quickly sent one of the staff to take pictures of the two men. He then sent them to every owner of a resturant, bar, nightclub and shop on the island and explained what had happend.

The following week, the two guys could not buy a beer or food on the entire islanď, and had to go by boat for 30 minutes to do so. I still get the chills when i hear this story.

2013-07-17 05:43:22+00:00,2922,Lying about heart problems?,GSXR450x,"**Background**:

I worked at a busy Waterpark similiar to Six Flags as a lifeguard/attendant. It was the middle of summer, there were thousands of people in the park, and good 'camping/setup' spots where limited by lunch time.

**Situation**:

While lifeguarding over a fake beach/wave pool, we were periodically required to tell customers on the dining table that the seating was short term seating only, while they eat their food etc. Otherwise people leave there towels and bags over every table, and flip out if anyone tries to eat at 'their table'

Most people are cool and clear out after eating, freeing it up for the next customers. These tables are constantly packed when it's busy.

One lady has decided that she'll pull 2 tables, and 8 chairs together, spread all her stuff around, and start reading a book (with a coffee). This is incredibly rude, and pisses a lot of customers off (rightly so).

So after the waves turn off (20 min on, 10 off) I do the walk through with the same speal ""Limited seating, appreciate if you could free up once you're finished your meals etc etc"" I get to this lady who says:

""Im drinking a coffee""

""I understand, but you can't really set up 'base' here, we keep the dining tables free for people with food to have somewhere to eat. There are plenty of spaces here, here n here""

""yeah, thanks...""

Another half hour goes, I go through the tables again, same speal etc, get to this lady.

""Sorry Ma'am, but I really have to ask you to move on shortly, you've taken up 8 seats and 2 tables for the last hour while only occupying one...""

""I'm reading a book! Get your manager if you have a problem, show some initiative! (She actually said that...)""

So call the duty manager over, he has a chat, calms her down, comes back to me and says ""She claims to have a heart problem and can't walk around much or be in the heat etc, so just let her be""

Not a problem, I'm not going to harass a lady with a *cough* heart problem, and the Manager is cool with it so I dont care.


**Revenge**:

About 3 hours later I was rotated on one of the more popular group waterslides. The lineup was over an hour.

Low and behold, look who it is! The same lady, with some of her friends.

She gets to the front of the line, attempts to step into the ride:

""Sorry Ma'am, unfortunately I can't let you ride this today""

""Why not!??!""

""As it's a 'thrill' ride, people with heart conditions aren't permitted to ride"" (not entirely true, they are just not advised to ride, I wasn't going to tell her this though)

""I don't have a heart condition!""

""I'm sorry if I was misinformed, but I've been notified that you have a heart condition, and so really wouldn't feel comfortable putting you in this situation, risking it etc, your friends are fine to go though!""

They all took off yelling and laughing etc

""This is b.s! I want to speak to your manager!""

""Certainly""

I radio'd to the Manager, briefly let him know the situation, and heard the amusement in his voice when he said he'll be around soon.

She waited another 30 mins standing at the top of this line, only to be greeted by, guess who, the same Manager she claimed she had the heart condition to. While putting on his incredibly sincere and concerned voice, told her how he couldnt possibly risk putting her in a situation like this, opening them up for court action etc. She tried pleading to him that she didn't really have a heart condition, and how it was something else etc.

2013-07-03 14:57:21+00:00,2221,DONT TOUCH MY CAKE,el_chunko,"Baked goods. Everyone loves baked goods. My sister, she probably loves them more then anyone. So on the day she was down and depressed after breaking up with her boyfriend, my brother and I swore to bring her cheer with a delicious chocolate cake.

We venture out the front door and hop into his Jeep and set on down the road to the local grocer. We arrive and as we are looking to park this women, who we will call the Blob, cuts us off and steals the parking spot we were waiting for. We shrugged it off as we are pretty relaxed fellows and parked in another spot. We make way into the grocery store, head directly to the baked goods counter, and wait in line to be served. The Blob pulls up behind us chattering away obnoxiously on her cell phone and completely oblivious to what was around her. Our turn to be served comes up, we select the last remaining chocolate cake, and ask the baker to out a message on our cake. She said it would take about ten minutes, as there was a line, and we told her we would be back to pick up our order. As we were walking away The Blob asks for a chocolate cake and is told there is none left and that we got the last one. She begins freaking out in a very entitled tone and demands that she receive said cake since we cut her off in the bakery line. However, the baker assures her we were here first and she would have to pick a different cake. At this point we could no longer hear what was happening but we didnt care as the Blob stole our parking spot, and got her just desserts as we took the last chocolate cake. However, our dealing with the Blob were far from over.

We headed to the frozen aisle to grab some pizza pockets, fries, chicken fingers, and other delectable snack foods as we were pretty starved. We headed back to the bakery counter only to find a different person behind the counter. We ask her for our cake and are told our sister picked it up. She then points down the bread aisle to the Blob with our cake in her motherfucking cart. Now most people would walk away and let this bitch eat her cake, but we were not backing down.

We followed her for some time through the grocery store. We decided to wait for an opportune moment and steal our cake back. The second she turned to grab something from the dairy fridge we gallopped over, grabbed the cake and ran headlong to the checkout. Looking back we saw she was distracted on her phone again and did not notice the cake was missing. We paid for our groceries and headed out to the truck.

As we were leaving we realized that maybe we could get a little extra revenge on her.

2013-06-21 18:15:01+00:00,2080,Steal my lunch? You're in for more than you expected.,rocketparrotlet,"This is a story from when I was in 8th grade.  To provide a little background, I was a nerdy kid of less than 100 pounds with no muscle whatsoever.  I was frequently bullied because of this, usually just verbal but sometimes more.  This kid named A realized that he could take my lunch and I couldn't do anything about it, so that went on for a few days.  He had a particular taste for packaged meat products- this is important.

After the second time he stole my lunch (and I went hungry as a result), I was fed up.  I went home, took a piece of beef jerky, and soaked it in Dave's Insanity sauce for 36 hours.  After sampling the meat (holy shit was it spicy, and I have a high tolerance for heat), I brought it in to school.  I told my friends and classmates what was about to go down so that they could watch it happen.

Well, what do you know, A came around and snatched the beef jerky out of my hands at lunch.  I hardly complained, just told him it was a special recipe of mine.  He took a giant bite and started to talk about how spicy it was, me telling him that was how I like it (and with a big shit-eating grin on my face).

Fast forward to 10 minutes later and A was visibly sweating, face red, swearing loudly about the beef jerky he was still nibbling on so he didn't look like a bitch in front of his friends.  He snatched my fruit snacks and applesauce, ate them in front of me, and then I knew I had to end this once and for all, so I tried to think of a plan.  Meanwhile, A spent the rest of lunch blocking anyone else from using the water fountain in order to wash the heat from his mouth.

On the way back from lunch, A still swearing at me, I told him I knew a little trick to get the heat out.  I told him to just massage the corners of his eyes, right near the tear ducts...

...A spent an entire period crying into the water fountain to wash the spice out of his eyes.  He never stole my lunch again.  And neither did anyone else.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1gt49z/steal_my_lunch_youre_in_for_more_than_you_expected/,pettyrevenge,109,
2013-06-20 15:37:45+00:00,2207,Threaten to sue me over your adult movie rental charges at a hotel? Be prepared to pay.,fierylady2,"I worked at a nice, 3 star hotel in a very rich suburb in 2007.  I worked the weekend night audit shift to have a little extra spending money while I was finishing up my Master's degree, since the rest of my weekly 8-5 money was going to pay my bills.  

It was Saturday morning around 5 am and I had just gotten finished putting all of the room checkout slips under the doors of the people checking out.  I was in back finishing up my paperwork when I hear ""ding ding ding"" (I would put a bell out if I was in back working so I knew when people came up to the desk.) I reply ""I will be back up in a minute"" and I heard ""ding ding ding"" again.  I ignore it since I knew he heard me, then he starts hitting the bell incessantly until I finally come up.

I come around the corner and take the bell out of his hands (since he's still ringing it even though I'm in front of him).  I smile and say ""How can I help you?"" and he replies ""There's a mistake on my bill.""  I take the bill and look at it, check his account, and say ""I don't see any mistakes on the bill.  What do you think is in error?""  He replies, ""These video charges... they aren't mine.""  I look at the bill again and see around $250 in video movie charges.  I reply back ""Sir, these were movies were checked out of your room and the system automatically processes them.""

He looks uncomfortable and he then accuses the housekeeping staff of renting the movies while he was out of his room.  I highly doubt this, but trying to give him the benefit of the doubt I say I will look into it.  He says he'll come back in a little bit.  I go back to the movie rental system and print out his rental report.  I don't really review it because I need to check my audit paperwork and finish running my reports.

He returns around 6:30 am and in tow with him are a group of other adults and kids checking out (he's chatting with them, so I assume they're in the same group).  He asks me if I have removed the charges and I go and grab his checkout report.  

One thing you should know is that the rental system in most hotels will tell the hotel staff exactly what movies were watched, when they were watched, and how long they were watched.  Usually if movies are flipped on by mistake (usually by a kid or rolling/sitting on the remote), most people catch it within the first few minutes and call down immediately to have the charges removed.  Which we have no problem with because hey, it happens.

I look over his report and ALL the movies rented are adult films.  They were all watched for 15-20 minutes and they were all late at night at almost the same exact time (there is no way the housekeeping staff was here that late at night or would be in someone's room). It was hard not to smirk, but I put a smile on my face and politely say ""I'm sorry sir, but the rental report shows that you did check out these movies and watch them."" I show him the report and his face totally falls.

Then this guy narrows his eyes and out of no where stars yelling at me. ""Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you, I DID NOT RENT THESE MOVIES.  YOUR HOUSEKEEPING STAFF ARE THE ONES WHO WATCHED THESE MOVIES.  THEY ARE STEALING MY HARD EARNED MONEY AND I'M GOING TO SUE YOU AND THE HOTEL.""

Well, I do not take well to being yelled at or being told I'm going to be sued.  So in front of all his friends and their kids, I loudly start reading the times, movie titles, and how long they were watched for.  A few of the adults start pulling their kids away from him, a few starting laughing at him, and one guy even said ""You sicko, just pay the nice lady your bill for your pornos.""  The best part: All the titles were for granny porn. 

He grabs the bill from me and runs out of the hotel (literally ran).  A bunch of the adults start laughing harder and I hope is that to this day they have not let him live it down.

**tl;dr** - Guy in hotel has about $250 in adult movie rentals.  He accuses the housekeeping staff of watching them in his room, so I read the list of granny porn he watched out loud to him in front of his friends.

**Edit 1**: Spelling

**Edit 2**: Not sure what to say to those who think it's fake... I really have no way of proving it true or false.  I haven't worked with the company since I graduated in 2008 and the only thing I have are my tax forms to prove I worked there.  So, think what you want... it happened and I've been laughing about it for years.  Just wanted others to share in my little bit of revenge since I don't get to do it that often.  It's a self post, so I don't get any karma for it one way or the other.

2013-06-12 15:39:14+00:00,2348,Petty Revenge at the Strip Club,DrRat,"A little bit of background before I get into the petty revenge. I’m a dancer at a strip club in Florida. It’s a small club in a relatively conservative area, so it’s pretty tame compared to a lot of other places. It’s more of a bikini bar as we must keep our bottoms on and our nipples covered with tape or tassels at all times under penalty of losing our job (which I’m OK with). In the past few years strip clubs have become more mainstream and popular with all types of people – not just the clichéd perverted old men (although we definitely still get those guys). We regularly host bachelorette parties, couples, groups of women, and groups of couples come in to enjoy the show. We even get middle-aged couples (they’re always the most fun and surprisingly accepting to the scene).  For the most part, the women are pretty cool with being surrounded by half-naked strippers, and enjoy hanging out with us, and we’re happy to have them there. MOST of them….not all. We get the occasional girlfriend or wife who comes in with a ‘holier than thou’ attitude who just sits there and scowls at everyone. Clearly she was dragged in against her will and wants to show her displeasure by trying to ruin the night for everyone. If you try to make conversation with them, they make passive-aggressive remarks putting you and your profession down.  That’s fine. Dancers have to have tough skin and lots of confidence, so we usually just go to the dressing room and laugh about how insecure the girl is. 


For those of you who aren’t familiar with how most strip clubs are set up, here is a brief explanation. Most have a bar right when you walk in so you can grab a drink. There is typically a stage with a dancer on it either in the middle of the club, or running along one wall. Generally, the closer to the stage you sit, the more open you are to talking to girls and getting private dances. The stage will have chairs around it which is called ‘the tip rail’. At the tip rail you have a very close view of the women on stage, but it is heavily implied that you must tip the dancer to sit there. At my club, there are about a dozen chairs around the stage.  When a dancer receives a tip at the tip rail, she normally does something a little extra for the guy. If it’s a dollar or two I just let them stick it in my G-string. If it’s $5-$10 I’ll motorboat, or shake my butt. If it’s $10-$15 I’ll wrap my thighs around their neck and jiggle the lady bits. Anything over $15 I’ll climb off the stage and give them a 30 second lap dance.  If a douchebag sits at the tip rail and tips nothing, then I will completely ignore them. An additional note: if you’re sitting at the tip rail, and all the chairs around the tip rail are full, and the club is packed your ass had better be tipping generously, because if you’re just sitting there taking up space from someone who would otherwise be tipping, then you’re essentially taking money out of my pocket. It’s truly frustrating, but we can't really say anything about it because tipping at the tip rail is only heavily implied, not required.


Here is where the petty revenge comes into play. Every once in a while one of those scowling, angry women sits at the tip rail –usually with the boyfriend or group of friends who are having a GREAT time – and doesn’t tip a single dollar. Her friends are usually tipping, but she will just sits there, arms crossed, pissed off and bitter. For the longest time my reaction to these women would be just to ignore them just like I do with non-tipping men. Then I mentioned it to a co-worker about how annoying these girls are because they bring down the mood of the night, and don’t tip when they should be. She told me I’m taking the wrong approach in ignoring them. Next time it happens, treat the girl like she tipped $15 – wrap your legs around her neck and stick your crotch right in her face. So I did. The next time a pissy girl came in and sat at the tip rail during a busy night and didn’t tip, I SHOWERED the girl with attention: boobs in her face, ass jiggling, thighs wrapping around her neck, pussy in the face, the whole nine yards despite her not tipping a single dollar. This is what happened: the guys LOVED it and threw TONS of money on the stage because, hey, girl –on –girl. The woman? Madder than hell, but unable to do anything about it because she’s sitting at the tip rail and I’m just doing my job. In addition, I’m the one smiling having a great time while she looks like a curmudgeon. It’s a win-win for me.
I now do this on a regular basis with almost the exact same results each time: I make more money, and at the same time piss off someone who clearly looks down upon my job.

Edit: I really hate when people edit, but it's pretty clear some of you have never been to a strip club. The atmosphere is VERY relaxed and chill. No one is sexually harassing anyone. The tip rail is literally the only place I do this. If someone isn't comfortable with it, they have a choice of about a hundred other chairs they are more than welcome to sit at without any disturbance.

2013-05-29 18:27:54+00:00,2994,Very Petty Revenge on Bratty Child in Waiting Room,jsh1138,"I just saw another thread here that reminded me of this story and thought I might as well contribute

So a few years ago I was at the vet's office waiting to pick up my dog from some routine something or other. I was the only person in the waiting room at first, but after awhile a mid 30's woman comes in with a young boy, probably 5 or 6 years old. 

For whatever reason, in a totally empty waiting room, they come and sit very close to me, over in the corner in a little alcove or whatever near a table with a bunch of magazines and coloring books on it. Before anyone says ""well no shit they came and sat near the coloring books"", there was more than one table like this in that waiting room

Ok so the mom is sitting across from me and the kid is next to her and in between us are these magazines and all that and some crayons and just junk on the table. Well I'm reading a magazine and the kid picks up a magazine that is obviously not something he's interested in, like the Economist or something. I turn a page in mine, he turns one in his. I sigh, he sighs. I move my leg, he moves his leg. I pick up another magazine, he picks up another magazine. He's copying me, in other words

So at first this was vaguely amusing, but then the longer it went on the less funny it got. Obviously I'm tired of waiting for my dog, ready to leave, etc, and this kid is mimicking everything I do with this shit eating grin on his face like he's got me and there's nothing I can do about it

Eventually it gets so that he's mocking my eye movements and facial expressions, stuff like that. I look over at the mom with a look of ""are you really going to just let your kid do this for 15 min straight to a total stranger?"" kind of in disbelief, and she's smiling at him like he's the most amazing kid in the world and clearly encouraging him to mock me some more

Up until this point, not a single word has been spoken between the 3 of us, its all non-verbal communication. But it was clear (to me anyway lol) that the kid was a brat, I wasn't in the mood, and the mom was over indulgent of him and something had to be done to right the balance of the universe

By this time it was obvious to the kid I was annoyed and I had been sitting totally still not doing anything for a minute or two while I thought this through, so he was afraid his game was over I guess. So finally I moved my arm with elaborate non-chalance and he got this huge grin on his face like ""fuck yeah! this guy still hasn't figured out i'm the king of this waiting room!"" and he mimics my arm movement very obviously

So then i reach over and get a coloring book. He gets a coloring book. I get a crayon, he gets a crayon. I slowly take the paper wrapper off the crayon, he take his wrapper off his crayon. He shoots his mom a jubilant glance once in awhile and she beams back at him like he's a good boy and is taking his first crap in the adult toilet or something

So i'm sitting there with this crayon and he's sitting there with his, waiting to mock me more, and the mom is looking on waiting to see how special and brilliant her child is going to be, and then i stick the crayon in my mouth and start chewing. 

Only not really, I palmed it and was making these exaggerated chewing motions with my jaw like ""OMG this crayon is SO good!"" with this look on my face like I was loving it. So then boy wonder stuffs his crayon in his mouth for real and starts going to town on it, bits of wax all in his teeth and shit, it was glorious

Finally mom springs into action and snatches him up by one arm and starts smacking his ass with the other hand, clearly furious, while staring at me the whole time like she wishes she was hitting *me*. I stare back with the shit-eating grin I just learned from her 5 year old. Then after about 5 smacks, she grabs the crying child and storms out of the vet's office in a huff

I have no idea what they were even there for, since they left without getting it, but I like to think that they went home with a little lesson in waiting room etiquette and I left with my (very) petty revenge and my loyal dog",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1fa7k5/very_petty_revenge_on_bratty_child_in_waiting_room/,pettyrevenge,231,
2013-05-26 01:10:04+00:00,2027,Revenge on a gas thief.,Riarkraa,"I live in a decent area that is situated a bit out into the country. I know most of my neighbors within a mile by name and we all help each other out all the time; this includes lending gasoline.

I had filled up the day before [gas station is 2 miles from the house and has competitive prices] so i knew my tank was supposed to show full. I come out to leave for work and turn the car on like normal and watch the gas gauge rise on back up...half way. Ok, no big deal; parents might have borrowed some. I can ask them when I get home.

They say no, they didn't, and offer to let me fill up from the gas cans we keep filled and stored for whatever we might need it for. I top my tank back off with this welcome help and go on in for the night. The next morning, crank up the car and... 1/4 a tank. Something fishy is up.

Asked my nearest neighbors if perhaps they had siphoned my tank for an emergency; its happened before, so figured perhaps that was the explanation. Nope. No one had done so. I figured I could only conclude there was some one stealing my gas. Time to fix that.

I go on to the gas station and fill up my tank again. I also fill a 1 gallon jug most of the way with diesel, then top off the jug with gasoline. The combine mixture now, for all intents and purposes, appears and smells like gasoline. 

I head on home and set up a pipe with a cap and sink it on into my gas tank, then take it out to be sure there were no leaks seeping into the pipe. I put the pipe back in and anchor it inside my tanks receiving tube [the portion leading down into the gas tank from the cap] and fill it with the gasoline-diesel, close my cap and go on in for the night.

Come out the next morning to find my neighbor's boyfriend across the street in a panic. I check the pipe on my car and sure enough, drained dry. Their car would no longer crank as they had poured their stolen goods into the tank.

2013-05-22 20:55:42+00:00,3117,"Really, I just wanted to get to the restroom.",msingerman,"This story dates from last June.  I was headed to San Diego for a conference.  The night before, I went out for some drinks with a coworker who would also be there.  A few drinks turned into us pretty much closing down the bar.  When I woke up at 6:30 later that morning, I actually felt great - I figured I must have drunk my way through the hangover!  This was of course a very stupid thought, and as the morning dragged on through getting to the airport, getting through security, and waiting at the gate, my head decided I am an idiot and deserve to be punished.  It was not wrong.

I made my way through the plane to my row, where I was to be seated in the window (a personal preference).  As I approached my row, I saw a woman sitting in the middle seat, with her belongings on my seat.  I politely said that it was my seat and waited for her to move them.  She let out an overly-large sigh, then laboriously moved her things onto her lap.  She then sat there.  And sat.  I asked her if she would mind letting me by, and she said the oddest thing:

""Go over me.""

Now at first, I assumed that this was my fault.  I assumed that in my awful, terrible hangover, I had forgotten how people board cramped seats and that I was wrong for assuming she would and should get up to let me in.  But then I remembered, I'm an idiot.  So I assumed she had some sort of physical disability which made standing and sitting difficult or painful for her, and rather than embarrass her I did as she requested, I went over her.

Shortly before takeoff, she stood up and hollered at her husband, who was in the back of the plane with their two children:

""I don't know why you couldn't get us seats together!  Honestly, this is absurd, why didn't you?!""

Lady, I got an idea why.

I didn't really care about her constantly reshuffling things or her armrest-hogging.  It did bum me out when her daughter came up to our row with a cheese and cracker platter and asker her mom if she wanted some and the lady simply said ""No.""  Eventually, I was able to fall asleep.

For those who don't drink, there is a phenomenon called the beer shits.  After a night of heavy drinking, you will often have a large amount of gas (and other things which go along with it) the next day.  About halfway through out flight, I felt this coming on, and I decided I had no choice but to go.  I asked her if I could please get out.  The gentleman in the aisle seat immediately got out, but she again said:

""Go over me.""

Now by this point, I was pretty irritable.  I had an awful headache, my stomach was doing somersaults, and I was about to blow an O-ring, and this miserable bitch wanted me to go over her?  On a moving plane?  Fine, I would.  I swung my right leg over her, then put my ass over her face, nearly touching.  A slight tremble in the flight, and I released a full-on, seemingly never ending fart, a cloud of noxious gas which should have had me arrested for war crimes.  I let the whole thing go.  Afterwards, I turned, made full eye contact, and said ""Sorry.  Turbulence.""  Everyone around me was fully and truly disgusted, and to them I am still so sorry, but I did what I did for the greater good.

2013-05-18 21:01:28+00:00,2236,I destroyed my nasty stepsister's ability to show off her wedding.,blurfactor,"Anon account for the obvious.

My stepsister was raised to expect everything handed to her on a platter. She's the first-born idol of her side of the family. She's not an only child but she fills every cliche of the spoilt brat only kid. I feel sorry for her brother and sister. They get treated so differently, although they're okay people for it they do miss out on a lot from their parents.

Stepsister is also a bigoted, racist cow. The filth that spills from her mouth and her attitudes about anybody who isn't attractive, cool, or *normal* is sickening. I've lived with it for years and I'm pretty bitter about it, though I keep the peace for my mom's sake. Worst that's happened between us is a screaming match where I ended up bawling and wilting because she hates the idea of gays being visibly gay, gays being allowed around kids, gay marriage, and she wonders out loud why we can't just shut the fuck up and hide like good little freaks. Me, I'm lesbian and out.

I'm not terribly confident at the best of times, though I'll stand my ground when it comes to that kind of bigotry, but her confidence is absolute. she feels she's right all the time and entirely dismisses anything that stands in the way of her bigotry and goes into attack if she feels threatened, and everything threatens her. Fuck I hate her.

Occasionally I check her facebook page (we're not friended, but it's well worth seeing what she's up to in order to prepare for her dramas before they hit the family). Before her wedding she had a meltdown on facebook at the cost of the photographer she wanted. I know the guy she wanted to use, and he's damned good and charges worthwhile prices for good work.

The kicker here is that's my profession too. Most of my income comes through my photography. Commercial and product though, not weddings thankfully.

And in a little post on the wall of a friend of hers, hidden from general view, she said she planned to get around even paying for a wedding photographer by inviting me. She knows I always have a camera on me and one or another of them comes with me everywhere. The presumptive cow decided she'd get free wedding photos out of me.

Day of the wedding I brought my worst camera body with a broken flash, and a useless 17-85mm lens (a rubbish lens to start with) that I borrowed (ironically from the photographer she wouldn't pay for) and had suffered from a water spill. It took photos with bad halos around EVERYTHING, and I took photos constantly in small jpg mode.

She asked for the photos from me after the wedding and I gave her the cards with them all on, straight from the camera.

It made her cry. She went fucking MENTAL at me to her and my family, but not a soul except her and her husband lay any blame on me for taking shit photos because hey, I was never hired for the job and never told to my face I'd be needed as a photographer, let alone paid for anything. If she had a clue beyond the superficial she'd realize that her wedding, the actual event, and the marriage that followed was the most special part of it all - but no. She considers the ability to show off her wedding to be the most important thing, and I removed some of that ability from her.

I took a small professional hit I'm sure, but I can live with that if it keeps her away from me.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1elg58/i_destroyed_my_nasty_stepsisters_ability_to_show/,pettyrevenge,266,

2013-05-02 15:23:40+00:00,2335,Don't fuck with an Australian. Mate.,jubjubmacrub,"This is your typical asshole neighbour revenge with a twist.

I have an asshole neighbour. He is an elderly-ish man - maybe around 60. Still works down in town. Anyway, we share the start of our driveway, except his goes past my house and down the valley a ways, where his house is. 

Now we had just got our driveway paved, meaning he had to park up on the road for the two days they were laying the sand and pavers. Its maybe a 25 meter walk down to his house. 

Not only did he berate me at long length when our paths met at the letterbox on the first day, but on the second, he outright abused me in front of my student (I tutor drums). I told my young student to go inside, as he was swearing furiously at me for having the nerve to ask him to park out front for two days. 

Fast forward to the next week. He decides to park in the middle of where our driveways split up. Meaning I have to park out on the road. Keep in mind this is actually my property, he's just a prick. That night, instead of abusing him the next time I saw him, I thought of a better revenge. 

In the dead of the night, I take a pack of frozen prawns out of my freezer. I sneak down my driveway and kneel down by one of his tyres. I then begin sliding frozen prawns one by one into his hubcap. Pushing them far enough in that they are invisible from the out side. I systematically fill each of his four hubcaps with two kilos of frozen prawns (4.4 pounds). 

Now keep in mind this is in the middle of a boiling hot Australian summer. Even by the next morning i could smell the prawns had thawed and were beginning to cook. Over the course of the next week I watched him inspect his car thoroughly, trying to work out where the abhorrent stench was coming from. He looked in his engine, all through his car, in his fucking exhaust for christs sake. 

But never deep within his hubcaps. 

They must have festered there for a good month before he finally sold his car. The smell was bloody horrible. Serves him right, the cunt.

2013-04-26 17:19:47+00:00,4105,"""Do you have any proof?""",Strange_Bedfellow,"This took place in a golf tournament I was playing in a few years ago. 

There was a long drive contest on the 18th hole. The way a long drive competition works in a tournament is there is a little marker with a pad of paper on it out in the fairway. If you hit your ball in the fairway past the marker, you sign the paper, and place the marker next to where your ball was. It's an honor system sort of thing, but then again, that's golf for you.

I was in the second-to-last group, one of my good friends was in the group behind me. I step up to the tee, tee up, and free the beast all over that golf ball. By some fluke, it ends up drawing down the right side of the fairway. I crushed this thing. Based on yardage left, I hit this ball a little over 330 yards. I had the previous long drive beat by almost 20 yards. I happily signed the marker, and put it next to my ball.

After I finished the hole, I walked off the green, and watched the foursome behind us tee off and play the hole in. You know, waiting for my friend, and to see if anybody beat my drive. Now, the men's tee box that we were supposed to play from was on the left side of the hole, and the ladies was 40 or so yards up and on the right side of the hole. I saw one of the guys tee up from the ladies tee, hit his drive, walk up, sign the marker, and move it to his ball. That shit ain't right.

They finish the hole, and my friend comes up to me and confirms my suspicions. This chucklefuck had hit from the ladies tee and taken my long drive. He beat me by two yards. I went up to the asshole, and had this conversation with him.

Me: ""Are you really going to take that drive?""

Him: ""Yep.""

Me: ""That's cheating, chief. You didn't win.""

Him: ""Do you have any proof?""

Well, fuck. It's his word against mine. The other guys in his foursome are his friends. My jimmies are at maximum overrustle.

We go to the post-tournament dinner. Sure enough, when they call the long drive winner up, this smug fucknut goes up and collects his (my) $50 Tim Hortons gift card. 

Oh, but what's this? He dropped something when he stood up. It's his door prize raffle ticket. It's number 77. Well, I'm just going to take this, you know, for my troubles. I lean over in my chair, and snag it off the floor

An hour later, we're at the final prize. It's the door prize draw. The prize?
 A $1000 MasterCard prepaid gift card. The MC rifles through the drum with the tickets. The universe must have been on my side that day, because the MC pulls out a ticket, and speaks into the microphone.

""The winner of the MasterCard prepaid card is... Ticket 77.""

Asshole McTerribleperson loses his shit. He's jumping up and down, yelling ""I won I won I won ohmygod I won!""

He runs up to the front to the MC, who then asks for the winning ticket. Fuckface sticks his hand in his back pocket. Then his other back pocket. Then the side pockets. His face looks like he just watched his dog just get run over. Repeatedly.

I'm crazy excited at this point, but I make a show of checking my ticket. Then I hold up the ticket and call out,

""I got it!""

I run up to the front, and give it to the MC. 

Douchebag McGee isn't happy about this. He starts yelling about how I stole his ticket and ticket 77 was totally his and I'm a cheater and a liar.

I look him dead in the eyes, and ask him deadpan ""do you have any proof?""

He looks like he's about to cry. The MC sends him to sit down, and I collect the $1000 dollar gift card.

Because I'm the type to salt the wound, as I leave, I walk past his table, and say quietly to him ""Enjoy your Tim card. You deserve it."" 

Pretty sure he popped a blood vessel. But I didn't stick around to find out. I had beers to buy for my friends.

2013-04-22 21:19:11+00:00,2723,College Party Throwers vs. Weekend Campers,[deleted],"When I was in college, my roommate and I were both engineers. This meant lots of tests/quizzes/labs on Fridays. The guys that lived below us were in one of the several colleges (I don't know which one) that had no class on Fridays, and so would hold parties almost every Thursday night. Obviously, not an ideal situation for us. Conversations with the downstairs neighbors resulted in near fisticuffs, so we decided another tact was required.

My roommate and I were climbers, we would go camping/climbing frequently, and after one particularly loud Thursday party, we were set to head out. My roommate, the acoustical engineer, brought in several impressive looking speakers from his lab along with some acoustical foam. We used the foam to ""soundproof"" the front door and we hooked the speakers up up, laid them down on the floor, face down, cranked the volume to max, and just before we left on Friday at about two, we hit play on a 5 second loop of ""Achy Breaky Heart."" ""Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart,"" repeat, repeat, repeat.

We returned about 50 hours later to death threats on the door. It appears that because we put the speakers face down and because of the acoustical foam, the noise was nearly inaudible at our front door, so the Police would not make entry, and the super was never available on weekends. So they got 50 full hours of achy break heart. 

We negotiated a ceasefire. No more parties past midnight on Sunday through Thursday in exchange for no more weekends of Billy Ray.

TL;DR - You throw a party before my test, you get Billy Ray Cyrus for the whole weekend.

2013-04-17 12:25:12+00:00,3325,"Here, have a parking ticket!",Radijs,"A little over a year ago I had just gotten my motorcycle license and I was on my way home.

I wasn't driving particularly fast, just some 5-10 kph over the speed limit, pretty normal.

Up behind me comes a car tearing up the asphalt. But I'm not in a hurry, my bike is new and I'm not gonna risk a ticket just cause this guy is in a hurry.

He starts to come up really really close behind me. Just a meter or two between his front bumper and my rear wheel. So now he's driving dangerously and putting me at risk. So I move over to the right side of the lane and give him room to pass figuring he'll go on on his jerkish way and be done with it.

Well...nope! He passes me and then slows down in front of me, and starts to break at random basically trying to tick me off even more.
At the next traffic light I tell the guy how dangerous his driving was and that he should quit it. Apparently I shouldn't have because he flips his lid and starts opening his car door, probably to give me a good kicking.

Thankfully the light turns green, I gun the engine, now really thinking ""fuck traffic regulations this guy's dangerous!"" Of course motorcycle in dense traffic beats a car no matter how nuts the driver is so I get away.

Later that evening I'm doing grocery shopping, no longer in my biking clothes and guess who I see at the checkout lane next to me? Yeah it's the asshole.

I'm out of the store before him and heeey, there's his car... And I happen to have found an old parking ticket on the ground. Rather then keying his car I slide the paper underneath his windshield and keep my distance, I'm gonna enjoy this little bit of payback....

And oh boy did I! Not only did he completely flip his shit about the ticket ( Which btw has a diffrent plate number on it but apparently he's blind with rage ).

Bonus points because there's 2 cops nearby. The asshole stomps over to them and begins to rant and curse and swear at them like there's no tomorrow. At first the officers try to calm him down but this guy's fucking nuts. So after a minute or so the officers have enough, perform the most beautiful takedown I've seen in my life and put the cuffs on him, he gets stuffed in the back of the van and hauled off to the station.

TL;DR: I give an asshole driver a fake parking ticket. Guy flips his lid and gets arrested for it.

**Edit: Thanks for all the cool comments everyone!**

Edit 2: Most of you have enjoyed this story immensely, but reasonably there have been a few comments that say that I made this up. I'll admit readily that it's a pretty incredulous story and I'm glad I can enjoy telling it now.

I do think it's unfortunate that this happened though. The revenge is sweet but the dangerous situations on the road are most definately not. Motorcyclists are vulnerable parties in traffic and dangerous driving like this can lead to horrible accidents. So I would definately prefer that this situation had never ocurred to begin with and I wouldn't wish this kind of situation to happen to anyone.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1cj0wl/here_have_a_parking_ticket/,pettyrevenge,247,

At a past job I had a long commute. It was 62 miles door to door. To save money I bought an early 80's Rabbit Diesel from an old man for $2000. 40MPG and it ran like a top.  
However, it was gutless, and some of this commute was through the foothills of the Colorado Front Range. Some of the larger hills would slow my top speed to about 50 on this 70MPH Interstate. I can handle this just fine, especially with the money it saved me.  

However, even though this is a three lane hiway and I kept to the right 100% of the time (never even tried to pass people on the very rare occasion it was an option) some people would still honk angrily or flip me off when they came up behind me. I was somehow inconveniencing them to force them to pass. Bear in mind my shift did not make me commute in rush hours... there was little to no traffic. 
One guy lost his everloving mind. Honking and flipping me off, he paced in the next lane becide me for a while- foaming and spitting, screaming and using every rude gesture in the book. Completely lost it. Then he moved on.  
 A few minutes later I arrive at work, and my boss asks me to sit in on a interview as the tech interviewer. I settle in and wait. The first smiling candidate that walks in, looks at me, and loses his smile. It is Mr Foaming Nutbag!

 Without saying a word, he turns and walks back out. I spend the next 5 minutes giggling while I explain to the boss what just happened.

2013-04-15 17:34:00+00:00,3089,Job Interview Revenge,[deleted],"So about 5 years ago I had a meeting in Beverly Hills. I flew in from Canada (my residence at the time) because this partner company was so important to our development in a product we were releasing. I prepared for about 2 weeks with our team and made the client aware that I was traveling abroad and looking forward to the 2 hours we had to go through fine details. Everything was confirmed, everyone was excited.

I landed in LA the day before, prepped, drove across town about 2 hour morning commute. Got to his office and sat in the waiting room while the admin told me he would be along shortly. I sat and sat...and sat. Finally she came out and told me that ""Lou"" had another meeting come up and apologized but couldn't make it. She would be happy to take any materials I had so he could review.

I reiterated how far I had traveled, that it was confirmed (at great expense) on several occasions. She said ""so sorry"".

He never showed up and then didn't respond to an email I sent for about 2 weeks where I showed my disappointment. H

is response was one **curt** line explaining his no-show.


     *""When my CEO calls me, I go. Sorry.""*


I later found out from people in our industry that he is a self important douchebag and that this is typical behavior. Nobody likes him, and he got to his position because of family. It turned out we didn't need his company and their competitor proved to be a great partner (silver lining).

Fast forward to a year ago...I am now the ""interviewing boss"" in my current company (same line of business) and we were hiring for a VP role out of NY. Wouldn't you know it his resume ended up in my desk. I told our admin (the entire back story) and to make sure to book the interview, he didn't know it was me that was first interviewer.

He told her that he would love to interview in LA where he lives, but unfortunately we said that he would have to make his way to NY if he was truly interested.

Well I guess he was. He flew all the way to NY and drove out to Long Island where my admin made him wait for 1 hour before informing him that I was unfortunately unable to make it and we would have to reschedule. So Sorry. I was chuckling about this from my office (In LA).

He emailed me and was VERY UPSET, to which I did not respond for a week (I couldn't wait a whole 2 weeks).

My response was verbatim, ""Apologies, but when my CEO calls, I go. Sorry""

I expected a long winded email back from him, but no - he simply said ""**Fuck You**"". It made me so happy and our company still laughs about it.

He also is still not working...he is ""consulting"". jobless asshole. He is still despised by our entire industry.

2013-04-09 15:07:49+00:00,3017,Me and a motel,[deleted],"Ex boyfriend is on the down and outs with nowhere to sleep. I take him to a motel and pay for the room via credit card. I wait at the car while he takes the t.v. remote to the room. He literally opens the door and tosses it on the bed and closes the door. As he is walking back to the car so I can take him to get something to eat, cops pull into the parking lot. Of course he has a warrant and they arrest him within 5 minutes.
I go back into the motel office and ask for a refund. I am told that I have to come back in the morning and speak with a manager.
The next morning the manager Calls Me, and tells me that there will be no refund as the room was used. I demand to see the room and go down there. 
They open the room, there are cigarette butts in the ashtray, but no ashes, the toilet paper is still wrapped but the sheets on the bed have been pulled down. Oddly there is not a dent in the pillows or a wrinkle on the bottom sheet. 
I proceed to argue with the manager and I quote he told me ""that we don't rent rooms out by the hour, I don't know what dirty deeds you did in there or how many men you had in there last night"". Umm excuse me! I have my own home and my own bed to do all of the dirty deeds my devious little mind can come up with! I was livid.
I went on the internet and found the corporate office in France. I wrote them a letter with a copy of my receipt (has time of transaction on it) and a copy of the arrest report ( has a time of arrest on it, literally 12 minutes after I paid for room).
Fast forward 2 weeks. I get a phone call from the motel asking me top come down. When I get there I am met by a very nicely dressed man with a French accent (AWESOME!). He asked me to point out the employees that were there when I got  the room and when I inspected the room. I did. They were arrested, it turn out they processed the refund but pocketed the money. My money was refunded and I got vouchers for 5 free nights for 2 people.

2013-03-19 03:20:28+00:00,2928,Revenge on a rude and obnoxious parent,swinebone,"I'm in graduate school and my paying job is as a behavioral therapist for a few families that have kids with autism. I often take my clients out to the local mall or whatever to engage them with the community.

One of my clients, ""Sean,"" has been diagnosed with both autism and a rare chromosomal abnormality. He's nonverbal and has severe physical and mental handicaps, but the dude is seriously one of the coolest people ever. He's obsessed with one of the department stores in the mall that employs pianists. I've spent hours sitting by the piano and listening to them play, which is fine because it's easy money for me and it's probably his most favorite thing ever to do.

The other week we were in there hanging out. ""Sean"" is standing up and rocking back and forth on his feet, clapping and squealing to himself at times. He may have been a little louder than the average customer, but it was a busy Thursday afternoon and he wasn't being disruptive in any way.

Lo and behold, a random woman comes up behind me and taps me forcefully on my shoulder. She tells me that Sean is being way too loud, for which I immediately politely apologize for. She continues to say that ""people like 'Sean' shouldn't be out in public"" and I ""should be ashamed to have a child like that.""

A few minutes later, the woman returns with her children and strikes up a short conversation with the pianist. Most of the pianists are elderly women that are just there to get out of the house, and since Sean and I are there all the bloody time I know them all by name and they often sit down with us during their breaks for small talk.

The woman asks the pianist if some of her brood could play on the piano, as her oldest is ""just *the* talk of her art school"" and is ""incredibly brilliant at the piano for her age level!"" The pianist looked her dead in the eye and said, ""I'm sorry, but we try not to encourage rude behavior in our stores. Perhaps children as brilliant as yours shouldn't be out in public?""

2013-03-07 16:59:22+00:00,2037,Super Bass... how about super evicted.,spaghettibeans,"I inherited a small bungalow home in central Florida. It wasn't much but it was home. The neighbors house were close on all sides which normally wasn't an issue.

A house next to the bedroom side of me was rented out to a young group of people who occasionally had loud late night parties. To me this wasn't a problem as i worked nights. For the other neighbors it was a nightmare. The group would always seem to turn the music off before the cops would arrive, threaten violence or vandalism to people if they would walk over to complain etc.

I was trying to stay out of the drama, until one of the punks got a new  ""system"" for his car. The bass would literally shake my walls. I tried to be civil and even asked politely for him to wait at least until I was awake ,around 12pm ,to rattle the few brain cells he had left into oblivion.  He blatantly refused and I'm pretty sure he did it more often to piss me off.

So, I did what the other neighbors had neglected to do. I got on the tax collectors website found out who owned the house. It was owned by an elderly couple in Massachusetts, where I'm from. After talking to them and gathering complaints form the others who had been harassed the landlords had enough and sent them a notice to vacate, which they ignored. 

I ended up being appointed (volunteer) property manager, and escorted a police officer to hand delivering the eviction notice to them 

The look on their face was priceless.

2013-02-28 17:35:17+00:00,2063,Strand my girlfriend? Enjoy your hike.,Magnus_Fojar,"I've been reading this subreddit since it started, and it's definitely  become one of my favorites. So I'm glad to finally contribute. I apologize if it's a bit long.

Background:

During college I was in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend Mary (now my wife). We went to neighboring state schools, which meant a lot of 3-4 hour drives back and forth most weekends. On this particular weekend Mary discovered that her friend, Jess, was also planning on visiting my school. They only lived about 30 minutes apart from each other, so it made sense to carpool for the long ride up. Jess offered to use her car if Mary would drive them up there, with the condition that Jess would drive Mary home on the way back.

Since it's a college town, parking was at a premium, and free parking was even harder to find. Luckily, some of my friends had a free lot on the outskirts of town. Since we're all doing each other favors I offered to park Jess' car there and save everyone some money.

I met them both when they arrived Friday afternoon.  Jess went to hang out with her friends,  and I parked her car in the free lot. I should mention that it's a very large town, and it was easily a 25 minute walk from Jess' friend's apartment to the free lot. That is, if you know where the free lot is located...

Anyway, we had an awesome weekend and Sunday rolls around meaning its time for Jess and Mary to go home. I was engaged in an all-day student club event when I got a phone call from Mary stating the following:  

Jess had decided that she didn't have time to drop Mary off at home anymore. And that she would leave Mary several towns over. At which point Mary should call another friend to take her the rest of the way. Oh, and can I go get Jess her car and bring it to her since I still had her keys?  Oh hell no!

I was pissed, and I was certainly not going to let Jess strand my girlfriend in an unfamiliar place with no means to get home. Mary was upset and didn't really know what to do since Jess was being a selfish bitch. It was at this point that I realized the only way I could guarantee for Mary to get home was to make the long drive there myself to drop her off. So I left my event, leaving my understanding friends shorthanded, and went to meet that bitch Jess.

The revenge:

I told Jess ""Sure, come to my apartment and I'll take care of you."" She arrived expecting her car, and was handed only keys. I pointed her in the direction of the lot, walked to my car and started driving Mary home. The thing is, the free lot was in an obscure and far away part of town. It took me 25 minutes to walk there, moving at a relatively fast pace, and knowing exactly where I was going.

Jess was still calling me 2 hours later trying to find her car from my intentionally vague directions. Mary was half way home before Jess even started her trip. I hope she grasped the irony that by trying to save 30 minutes, and screwing over my girlfriend, she ended up losing 2 hours of her time. But, that's probably giving her too much credit.

TL;DR:  My girlfriend's ""friend"" was willing to strand my girlfriend to save herself a half hour. She completely went back on everything she promised after taking advantage of our kindness. So I cost her 2 hours of her time, and a lot of stress.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/19emql/strand_my_girlfriend_enjoy_your_hike/,pettyrevenge,171,

You know the scam. Whine about perfectly good food to get some sort of comp.
In their old age, my parents befriended another older couple who would pull this stunt everywhere they went. After my mother told me a few stories about how their new friends had shown them how to get discounted or free meals, I felt like I was suddenly the responsible adult, concerned about the bad influence these people were on my parents. While visiting my parents with my girlfriend, this other couple attended dinner with us. As I expected, the food was brought to the table and they immediately began dramatically complaining to one another about the quality/taste/temperature/etc. They were making a scene in order to attract the attention of the waitress. When our waitress returned to ask how we were doing, the miserable old bastard who played the lead role in their act took a deep breathe, struck a dramatic pose (with his hand raised to begin gesticulating for emphasis) and bega--I leaned forward and cut him off before he could finish the first word: ""Everything is absolutely fantastic. It's all great! Thank you very much!"" She smiled, and began her obligatory ""Great, well if you need any--"" when he made a second attempt. ""We come here all the time an--"". I didn't acknowledge that he was speaking at all, repeated that all was just as we ordered and thank her again. He was stunned and thrown off from his routine by my interruption. During this pause the waitress walked away (It seemed clear that she knew what they were trying to accomplish). He turned bright red. I turned to my girlfriend and, smiling and without lowering my voice, stated how pitiful it is that some people could be dishonest, deceitful and put at risk the livelihood of a cook, server or hostess for a pathetic discount or a free early-bird special.

After she found everything she needed, she went up the register where a 50-ish year old woman was manning the ancient (read: not digital, almost a typewriter) register.

After a few minutes of slowly clicking and completing the sale, my sister gave her the money and took her items, but didn't leave. The cashier leaned over the register and told her, ""move aside, little girl. Better luck next time"". My sister then asked, ""do you have a customer service desk?"". Confused, the woman replied ""no, no we do not. Our cashiers handle everything"".

""Alright"", my sister mused, ""I'd like to return these items"".

""Are you serious?"".

By now, a sizable line had built up behind my sister, and they were starting to murmur about why the only register in the store was taking so long.

""Yes, I'd like to return these items please"".

By now, it seemed like half the store was waiting for this crabby cashier to finish with my sister, and even the store manager was out on the floor at this point, watching it all.

*Finally*, the return was complete. ""Please don't put those items away yet"" my sister advised the cashier as she was handed her change. She grabbed the items, put them back on the desk, and looked the cashier right in the eye.

2013-01-04 16:59:29+00:00,2567,"""It's OK ladies, this round is on me!""",PrinceBarrington,"A couple of years back myself and a couple of friends were enjoying some late night weekend drinking. As usual, the bar was packed and I was still waiting for drinks after 40 minutes or so. I am not a patient person. I saw many people come and go from the bar yet I was still to be served. When I finally secured a place at the bar, about to hail the bar steward, only to notice a sharp, digging pain in my left side. I look, a young girl, around 18 yo was stood there, I heard her friend tell her to 'dig her elbows deeper'. Then she somehow managed to get in front of me to the bar, block my path and allow her pal access. I had waited too long for this to happen and not yet being drunk I quickly thought of a plan. 

""It's OK ladies, allow me. This rounds on me. What would you like?""

They requested their order, though I never bothered to listen to it. They then freed up some space for me to get to the bar. I ordered my drink and nothing more. I then proceeded to explain to the barman how I had heard these girls talking about school and probably weren't old enough for drinking. I turned around to see them casting me some really evil looks as I left the bar with only my drink. They lost their place, had to wait some more time only to be refused drinks as they failed to produce ID.

tl;dr Girl elbows me out of the way in a bar queue, I offer to buy drinks and instead buy only my own, alert the bartender to possible under-age drinking. Feel like a boss all night.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/15yhae/its_ok_ladies_this_round_is_on_me/,pettyrevenge,144,
2013-01-01 17:59:57+00:00,2082,Enjoy your first class seat lady...,Muuviestar,"I arrive at the gate to work a flight.  The crew finds out that the plane has been downgraded to a smaller aircraft.  This new aircraft has only one cabin of service and holds about 20 less people.  There is a very wealthy woman (identified by her designer luggage, jewelry, and entitlement) screaming at the gate agent that she wants a first class seat.  The gate agent explains that this aircraft does not have a first class cabin, but she is in row three and that is close to the front. 

She continues to scream at the gate agent and makes unreasonable demands.  When boarding begins I find her. She sits down in row 1 and refuses to move when I ask to see her boarding pass and redirect her to row 3.  I ask her again to move and she says to the window, ""I am through speaking to the help."" 

Fine. 

I move the nice couple originally sitting in row 1 to row 3. I move a mom with her screaming crying infant into row 1 next to the lady who doesn't speak to the help. The entire flight the baby cried, and the entire flight the woman looked around for a new seat but we were full. Ha.

2012-12-14 03:19:40+00:00,2658,"""You should be paying ME to talk to YOU!""",dragongrl,"   Many many many years ago, in the early days of cell phones, I worked customer service for a cell phone company, who's name is just a bunch of letters.  This man called in, and I was lucky enough to get him on my headset.
  
   ""Thank you for calling &lt;redacted&gt;.  How can I help you?""

   Him (screaming) ""This fucking phone isn't working!  I can't make calls and people call me and just get my voice mail!  Fix it god damnit!""

   Usually, the first thing we do is have to customer power the phone off and then on again.  Nine times out of ten, this re-registered the phone on the cell site and made it work again.  So I suggest this to him.  He just continues to scream.

   ""Fuck you I'm not doing that!  I'm a fucking lawyer.  My time is very valuable!  People pay me hundreds of dollars an hour.  You should be paying ME to talk to YOU!""

   As he's ranting, I'm checking out the computer.  We had two programs; one that was Windows based, contained all the normal account stuff and a DOS based program that would show you what cell sites they were pinging off of, as well as allow you to deauthorize their phone, basically knocking it off the cell site until they powered the phone off and on (sometimes the phones got hung up between sites).  The Windows program could be seen by the bosses, but the DOS one could not.

   I check his account in Windows.  He's all paid up and everything's fine from that angle.  I pull up the DOS program and sure enough, the cell sites aren't picking up his phone.  So I tell him again to just turn the phone off and on again, and that should fix the problem.

   ""FUCK YOU!  I shouldn't have to do that!  I shouldn't have to do anything you dumb bitch!  You need to fix this right now.  And I want my account credited for every second I can't use my phone!""
    I explain that we can't do that, his service is fine, all he has to do is pick up the cell site again.  He continues to scream, yell and threaten to get me fired if I don't fix his phone and give him credit.  I keep telling him he has the ability to fix the problem himself if he just presses that one little power button. After some more cursing and sputtering, he finally hangs up on me.

   After he hangs up and my ears stop bleeding, I go to add my notes about the call into the Windows program.  I look back at the previous notes and see this guy has been a douche-nozzle to every single operator he's ever spoken to.  So I write his phone number down on a little post-it and stick it to my computer.  For the rest of the time I worked there, whenever I had a spare minute, I'd pull his phone up in the DOS program and knock it off the cell site.  And I did it completely randomly.  Sometimes once a day, sometimes as many as twenty.

Circling the parking lot for literally a half hour looking for a spot since my roommate insisted she couldn't go shopping alone.  Finally found a spot in the way back of the parking lot.  Doesn't matter.

I wait for the car leaving the spot to exit, turn signal on.  He leaves and as I begin to pull in, someone whips out from behind me and makes it into the spot before I can, almost hitting my car in the process and scaring the shit out of me.

But he moved so quickly to get my spot that he ended up parking crookedly and couldn't exit his car.

So I just pulled up behind him.  Now he couldn't adjust.  And he was too heavy to climb across to the passenger door, though he did attempt it.

He was giving me the middle finger and shouting at me to move so he could readjust.  I literally stayed there for 15 minutes (to my roommate's annoyance) until he called security who asked me to move.

When I told security what had happened, *he made the guy leave the parking space or be ticketed.*

Fantastic.

A mid 30s woman in an Acura whips into adjacent parking spot, opens her door hard into my door and does not say whoops, sorry, or even kiss my arse. She did not even make eye contact with me sitting there in the passenger seat with the window open. She simply locked her car and hurried off.

I stewed about this for a minute or so, while enjoying my fries. The gulls were gathering in numbers as I had tossed a few chips out for them, and then I noticed she had left her sunroof open. I tossed a chip and scored 2-points directly into the Acura. The gulls showed interest so I tossed another. One brave gull dropped right down into the car to get the chips. I kept tossing chips and managed to get 6 gulls squabbling inside her car.

2012-11-05 17:52:12+00:00,4464,"Run-over Another Snowman, Jackass—I can build these all day.",TheCannibalLector,"12 years ago, when I was in 10th grade, my sister (who was 8 at the time) built a giant snowman after an unusually heavy Pennsylvania snow.  She spent all day on this thing and it was actually pretty impressive.  

The town I'm from is actually a borough and it only has something like 7,000 people who live there, meaning High School classes were small and relatively tight-knit.  There was one particular kid, who I'll call Scotty, who drove me up the fucking wall.  He never did anything to me personally, but he just had a massively annoying way about him.  To make matters worse, it seemed as if I had way too many classes with him to be statistically possible.

One of Scotty's irritating behaviors is that he drove a loud, redneck-ish, John-Deere-green truck.  It was obnoxious as hell and (important to the story later) had a huge brush guard on the front of it.    

Well, on the evening after she built her snowy sentinel, I heard the sound of Scotty's truck making its way down the street from inside our livingroom.  Then I heard the ""pfft"" of someone running over a snowman and laughing.  Unfortunately for my sister, she had built it close to the road and too easily within the range of this semi-guided asshole.  She was rather upset to see her day's work splattered all over the street...  Something needed to be done about this.

So, the next morning, I woke up early and began building another snowman.  It was glorious.  I made the classic, three section, scarf-wearing, sticks-for-arms-and-vegetables-for-a-face snowman.

This new snowman's cheery countenance betrayed a grim and dark secret, however; Frosty was built on top of a fire hydrant at the corner of our yard where there was no curb.

For a good two days I dreamt of Scotty wrapping his stupid truck around my masterpiece out in the yard.  But no dice.  I didn't see him at all anywhere around town so I thought I was out of luck.

Then, on the evening of the 4th day, I heard it.  My family was eating dinner and I heard the low grumble of fate's motors kicking from gear to gear.  Would they find themselves abruptly halted in about 10 seconds?  It all depends on you, Scotty boy...

So I start chewing my food really fast because, knowing the idiot, I knew what was happening next.  The final acceleration sounded off like a chaotic crescendo as he plowed straight into—not through—the snowman with the deafening crunch of twisting metal.

My family ran outside and it took everything I had to not laugh before I got out there.  There stood Scotty, dazed and bewildered and caught-off guard by a battle that he lost before he realized it had begun.

2012-11-02 22:03:31+00:00,3540,Evil elementary school girl,LaserGuidedHerpes,"Ok this may be an example of preemptive revenge, but considering how it happened I'm still pretty sure I was entirely in the right. not sure how petty it was. But anyways...

 In elementary school I wasn't the most popular kid, I was into books, had big glasses, into video games, got very grades, classic nerd. I had friends sure, but I did tend to be the butt of the classic ""nerdy-kid"" jokes.

One day in class we were doing some sort of busy work and I was seated across from one of the girls (let's call her BitchJ) who always loved to make fun of me and give me crap. The girl for some reason was stamping her feet up and down on the floor like a crazy person (not just the nervous knee thing that most people get from time to time, full on lifting and dropping them fuckers). 

The massive shockwaves from her dinosaur stomping ending up knocking her glasses off the desk and somewhere right beneath her feet. Being the good guy that I was, I immediately yelled out ""BitchJ, STOP, WATCH YOUR FEET!"". She stops her foot, a few inches from her glasses, then looks at me and just asks, ""Why?"".

Now I could have told her that she was about to ruin her glasses, but for some reason I didn't. I happened to not be wearing my own glasses at the time, and on a lark I told her, ""You're about to step on my glasses"". 

The bitch got the biggest grin on her face, lifted her foot back up and smashed it back down onto her own glasses. BitchJ heard them crack and bent down to pick the glasses up, still grinning at me without breaking her gaze. When she lifted the glasses up and looked at them, and realized they were her own, she started crying, loudly. Ran to the teacher.

It was wonderful",http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/12jbgy/evil_elementary_school_girl/,pettyrevenge,103,
