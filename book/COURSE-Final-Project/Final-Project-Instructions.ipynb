    "For the final project, you will apply the critical and technical skills that you've learned this semester on a topic and dataset of your choice. You are free to choose **any topic or dataset** that you want, but it must be related to culture or the humanities in some way. You can pick a dataset that we've worked with in class or one of the midterm project options, but in that case you must analyze  it from a substantially different angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore a question or curiosity about this dataset, you will use **at least one of the methods** that we've learned in class — data analysis with Pandas, word frequencies, tf-idf, topic modeling, NER, network analysis, or mapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "After your **computational analysis**, you will **write a 1,000-2,000 word Medium blog post** that tells a story or makes an argument based on your results and findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, you will partly describe your data-driven analysis, but you will also relay what's interesting and important about the analysis to your reader. We want to encourage you to write for target audiences beyond Prof. Walsh and the TAs. Who else will find this blog post interesting? How would you write for that audience? How would you write for your friends or family?\n",

    "## Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final project, you have the option of working alone or working with up to 2 partners. To find collaborators, you can post your project idea to this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ziQlXzihf49iaUnTlhbj3nA0YnSc1Mm7dTi-iApxPDk/edit?usp=sharing) and say how many collaborators you're looking for. If other students are interested in working with you, they can hopefully email you to connect.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You will again publish your blog post to our [Medium course page](https://medium.com/introduction-to-cultural-analytics) ([instructions for posting are here](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213904978-Add-a-draft-or-post-to-publication)). Each partner will submit a Jupyter notebook to Gradescope (\"Final-Project-LASTNAME.ipynb\") that includes a link to your blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're finished with the project, you will also fill out a [self/peer evaluation](https://forms.gle/8UiDc25RQBCzytnm9) and evaluate the participation of each group member. If group members participate less than others, their grades will be adjusted to reflect this contribution."
